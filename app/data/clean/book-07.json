The revelation only confirms the dark fear that has haunted her since childhood. In fact, what little she knows about her birth and her mother's subsequent death, is a fragile web of evasions and lies.<br /><br />Determined to expose the truth at any cost, Haskell takes a job at Chicago's famed Oriental Institute in the city where her mother once lived and loved. But as she searched the shadows of the past, she finds that the truth can sometimes be deadly.",

    "description": "Valencia is the fast-paced account of one girl's search for love and high times in the drama-filled dyke world of San Francisco's Mission District. Through a string of narrative moments, Tea records a year lived in a world of girls: there's knife-wielding Marta, who introduces Michelle to a new world of radical sex; Willa, Michelle's tormented poet-girlfriend; Iris, the beautiful boy-dyke who ran away from the South in a dust cloud of drama; and Iris's ex, Magdalena Squalor, to whom Michelle turns when Iris breaks her heart. Valencia conveys a blend of youthful urgency and apocalyptic apathy.",

    "description": "In <i>The Right Address</i>, Carrie Karasyov and Jill Kargman seared through the upper crust of New York\u2019s glitterati with wicked glee. In their delicious new novel, <i>Wolves in Chic Clothing</i>, they train their merciless spotlight on the young princes and princesses poised to inherit Park Avenue. <br /><br />Julia, a hip, downtown salesgirl at Pelham\u2019s jewelry store, finds her social life turned on its head when she is asked to deliver a necklace to the store\u2019s young heiress, Lell Pelham, on Lell\u2019s wedding day. Beguiled by Julia\u2019s earnest cluelessness and her vintage-chic vibe, Lell and her gang adopt Julia, and \u201cEliza Doolittle\u201d her into passing as the heiress to a family fortune, just for a laugh. Dazed by the whirlwind of trust funds, pedigrees, Cosmopolitans, and penthouses in her new world, Julia is unprepared for the ardent advances of Lell\u2019s husband\u2014or the vicious claws her new \u201cfriends\u201d develop when they decide Julia is an ingrate, and demote her from society goddess to penniless cling-on with one well-timed editorial. Suddenly, she must return the borrowed couture clothes and try to remember who she was before the body snatching took place. Hilarious and completely addictive, <i>Wolves in Chic Clothing</i> is a modern-day rags-to-riches-and-back-again fairy tale that will leave fans stamping their Manolo Blahniks for more.",

Believed to be possessed, she is brought to a convent for observation. And into her cell stumbles Father Cayetano Delaura, who has already dreamed about a girl with hair trailing after her like a bridal train. As he tends to her with holy water and sacramental oils, Delaura feels something shocking begin to occur. He has fallen in love, and it isn't long until Sierva Maria joins him in his fevered misery. <br /><br />Unsettling and indelible, <i>Of Love and Other Demons</i> is an evocative, majestic tale of the most universal experiences known to woman and man.",

In Paris, Francisco Solano -- the future dictator of Paraguay -- begins his courtship of the young, beautiful Irish courtesan Ella Lynch with a poncho, a Paraguayan band, and a horse named Mathilde. Ella follows Franco to Asunci\u00f3n and reigns there as his mistress. Isolated and estranged in this new world, she embraces her lover's ill-fated imperial dream -- one fueled by a heedless arrogance that will devastate all of Paraguay.<br />With the urgency of the narrative, rich and intimate detail, and a wealth of skillfully layered characters, The News from Paraguay recalls the epic novels of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Mario Vargas Llosa.",

Unfortunately, the much-anticipated event is soon overshadowed by a murder as daring as it is sudden. It\u2019s a case of weeding out a cunning killer who can turn up anywhere\u2014and Wolfe must do it quickly. Because a second case awaits his urgent attention: a society widow on a mailing list of poison-pen letters leading to a plot as dark as any orchid Wolfe has ever encountered.",

    "description": "\"Air Guitar\" is Dave Hickey's \"memoir without tears\"--a journey through the vernacular cultural landscape of the United States in the second half of the twentieth century. Looking back from the vantage-point of his adopted hometown of Las Vegas, Nevada, Hickey speculates on everything from jazz and rock-and-roll to basketball and professional wrestling--from magic and psychedelia to gambling and the culture of \"little stories\"--from automotive design to series television to Saturday-morning cartoons. The emphasis in these twenty-three essays is on the way \"the arts\" function in the drift of everyday life, outside the venues of official culture, and on singular \"lives in the arts, \" lived outside those venues, with meditations on the careers of Liberace, Hank Williams, Chet Baker, Andy Warhol, Johnny Mercer, Norman Rockwell, magicians Siegfield &amp; Roy, and wrestler Lady Godiva. Underlying Hickey's writing is an abiding belief that cultural life in a democracy can, and occasionally does function in a democratic manner, sustained by the whims of affection and the commerce of opinion.",

    "description": "In January 2002 Rory Stewart walked across Afghanistan-surviving by his wits, his knowledge of Persian dialects and Muslim customs, and the kindness of strangers. By day he passed through mountains covered in nine feet of snow, hamlets burned and emptied by the Taliban, and communities thriving amid the remains of medieval civilizations. By night he slept on villagers' floors, shared their meals, and listened to their stories of the recent and ancient past. Along the way Stewart met heroes and rogues, tribal elders and teenage soldiers, Taliban commanders and foreign-aid workers. He was also adopted by an unexpected companion-a retired fighting mastiff he named Babur in honor of Afghanistan's first Mughal emperor, in whose footsteps the pair was following. Through these encounters--by turns touching, confounding, surprising, and funny--Stewart makes tangible the forces of tradition, ideology, and allegiance that shape life in the map's countless places in between.",

    "description": "<b>The multi-million-copy bestseller that coined the phrase for tragic American blunders abroad.</b><br /><br />First published in 1958, The Ugly American became a runaway national bestseller for its slashing expose of American arrogance, incompetence, and corruption in Southeast Asia. Based on fact, the book's eye-opening stories and sketches drew a devastating picture of how the United States was losing the struggle with Communism in Asia. Combining gripping storytelling with an urgent call to action, the book prompted President Eisenhower to launch a study of our military aid program that led the way to much-needed reform.<p>\"Powerful and absorbing.... Should be required reading in Washington\". -- Kirkus Reviews</p><p>\"Not only important but consistently entertaining.... The attack on American policy in Asia this book makes is clothed in sharp characterizations, frequently humorous incident, and perceptive descriptions of the countries and people where the action occurs\". -- Robert Trumbull, former chief correspondent for the New York Times in China and Southeast Asia</p>",

    "description": "Lonnie Kingman is in a bind. He's smack in the middle of assembling a civil suit, and the private investigator who was doing his pretrial legwork has just dropped dead of a heart attack. In a matter of weeks the court's statute of limitations will put paid to his case. Five years ago David Barney walked when a jury acquitted him of the murder of his rich wife, Isabelle. Now Kingman, acting as attorney for the dead woman's ex-husband and their child (and sure that the jury made a serious mistake), is trying to divest David Barney of the profits of that murder. But time is running out, and David Barney still swears he's innocent.<br /><br />When Kinsey Millhone agrees to take over Morley Shine's investigation, she thinks it is a simple matter of tying up the loose ends. Morley might have been careless about his health, but he was an old pro at the business. So it comes as a real shock when she finds his files in disarray, his key informant less than credible, and his witnesses denying ever having spoken with him. It comes as a bigger shock when she finds that every claim David Barney has made checks out. But if Barney didn't murder his wife, who did? It would seem the list of candidates is a long one. In life, Isabelle Barney had stepped on a lot of toes.<br /><br />Somewhere out there, a killer waits to see just what Kinsey will find out. Somewhere out there, someone's been getting away with murder, and this time it just might turn out to be Kinsey's.",

    "description": "Taken by surprise, a small coastal town is overrun by an invading army with little resistance. The town is important because it is a port that serves a large coal mine. Colonel Lanser, the head of the invading battalion, along with his staff establishes his HQ in the house of the democratically elected and popular Mayor Orden.<br /><br />As the reality of occupation sinks in and the weather turns bleak, with the snows beginning earlier than usual, the \"simple, peaceful people\" of the town are angry and confused. Colonel Lanser, a veteran of many wars, tries to operate under a veil of civility and law, but in his heart he knows that \"there are no peaceful people\" amongst those whose freedom has been taken away by force. The veil is soon torn apart when Alexander Morden, an erstwhile alderman and \"a free man,\" is ordered to work in the mine. He strikes out at Captain Loft with a pick axe, but Captain Bentick steps into its path and dies of it. After a summary trial, Morden is executed by a firing squad. This incident catalyzes the people of the town and they settle into \"a slow, silent, waiting revenge.\" Sections of the railroad linking the port with the mine get damaged regularly, the machinery breaks down often, and the dynamo of the electricity generators gets short circuited. Whenever a soldier relaxes his guard, drinks or goes out with a woman, he is killed. Mayor Orden stands by his people, and tries to explain to Col. Lanser that his goal \u2013 \"to break man\u2019s spirit permanently\" \u2013 is impossible.<br /><br />The cold weather and the constant fear weighs heavy on the occupying force, many of whom wish the war to end so that they can return home. They realize the futility of the war and that \"the flies have conquered the flypaper.\" Some members of the resistance escape to England and ask the English for explosives so that the townspeople can intensify their efforts. English planes parachute-drop small packages containing dynamite sticks and chocolates all around the town. In a state of panic, the army takes the Mayor and his friend Dr. Winter, the town doctor and historian, hostage and lets it be known that any action from resistance will lead to their execution. Mayor Orden knows that nothing can stop his people and that his death is imminent. He tells his wife that while he can be killed, the idea of Mayor (and freedom and democracy) is beyond the reach of any army. Before his execution, Mayor Orden reminds Dr. Winter of the dialogues of Socrates in the Apology, a part he played in the high school play, and tells him to make sure that the debt is repaid to the army, i.e., that the resistance is continued.",

    "description": "Whether we love or hate Sigmund Freud, we all have to admit that he revolutionized the way we think about ourselves. Much of this revolution can be traced to <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, the turn-of-the-century tour de force that outlined his theory of unconscious forces in the context of dream analysis. Introducing the id, the superego &amp; their problem child, the ego, Freud advanced scientific understanding of the mind immeasurably by exposing motivations normally invisible to our consciousness. While there's no question that his own biases &amp; neuroses influenced his observations, the details are less important than the paradigm shift as a whole. After Freud, our interior lives became richer &amp; vastly more mysterious. These mysteries clearly bothered him--he went to great (often absurd) lengths to explain dream imagery in terms of childhood sexual trauma, a component of his theory jettisoned mid-century, tho now popular among recovered-memory therapists. His dispassionate analyses of his own dreams are excellent studies for cognitive scientists wishing to learn how to sacrifice their vanities for the cause of learning. Freud said of the work contained in <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, \"Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a lifetime.\" One would have to feel quite fortunate to shake the world even once.--Rob Lightner",

    "description": "The last book published during Kafka's lifetime, <i>A Hunger Artist</i> (1924) explores many of the themes that were close to him: spiritual poverty, asceticism, futility, and the alienation of the modern artist. <br /><br />He edited the manuscript just before his death, and these four stories are some of his best known and most powerful work, marking his maturity as a writer. In addition to \"First Sorrow,\" \"A Little Woman,\" and \"Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse People\" is the title story, \"A Hunger Artist,\" which has been called by the critic Heinz Politzer \"a perfection, a fatal fulfillment that expresses Kafka's desire for permanence.\" <br /><br />The three volumes Twisted Spoon Press has published: <i>Contemplation</i>, <i>A Country Doctor</i>, and <i>A Hunger Artist</i> are the collections of stories that Kafka had published during his lifetime. Though each volume has its own distinctive character, they have most often appeared in English in collected editions. They are presented here as separate editions, in new translations by Kevin Blahut, each with its own illustrator from the Prague community.",

    "description": "This comprehensive new look at the hormonal roller coaster that rules women's lives down to the cellular level, \"a user's guide to new research about the female brain and the neurobehavioral systems that make us women,\" offers a trove of information, as well as some stunning insights. Though referenced like a work of research, Brizedine's writing style is fully accessible. Brizendine provides a fascinating look at the life cycle of the female brain from birth (\"baby girls will connect emotionally in ways that baby boys don't\") to birthing (\"Motherhood changes you because it literally alters a woman's brain-structurally, functionally, and in many ways, irreversibly\") to menopause (when \"the female brain is nowhere near ready to retire\") and beyond. At the same time, Brizedine is not above reviewing the basics: \"We may think we're a lot more sophisticated than Fred or Wilma Flintstone, but our basic mental outlook and equipment are the same.\" While this book will be of interest to anyone who wonders why men and women are so different, it will be particularly useful for women and parents of girls.",

    "description": "In 1994, Rwanda was the scene of the first acts since World War II to be legally defined as genocide. Two years later, Clea Koff, a twenty-three-year-old forensic anthropologist, left the safe confines of a lab in Berkeley, California, to serve as one of sixteen scientists chosen by the United Nations to unearth the physical evidence of the Rwandan genocide. Over the next four years, Koff\u2019s grueling investigations took her across geography synonymous with some of the worst crimes of the twentieth century. <i><br /><br />The Bone Woman</i> is Koff\u2019s unflinching, riveting account of her seven UN missions to Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo, and Rwanda, as she shares what she saw, how it affected her, who was prosecuted based on evidence she found, and what she learned about the world. Yet even as she recounts the hellish nature of her work and the heartbreak of the survivors, she imbues her story with purpose, humanity, and a sense of justice. A tale of science in service of human rights, <i>The Bone Woman</i> is, even more profoundly, a story of hope and enduring moral principles.",

Minutes later, she stumbles upon a gallery containing a one-artist exhibition called \"The Sleeping Women,\" a mysterious series of paintings that has caused a sensation in the world of modern art. Collectors have come to believe that the canvases depict female nudes not in sleep but in death, and they command millions at auction. When Jordan approaches the last work in the series, she freezes. The face in the painting seems to be her own.<br /><br />This unsettling event hurls her back into a nightmare she has fought desperately to put behind her-for, in fact, the face in the painting belongs not to Jordan but to her twin sister, murdered one year ago. At the urging of the FBI, Jordan becomes both hunter and hunted in a duel with the anonymous artist, a gifted murderer who knows the secret history of Jordan's family, and truths that even she has never had the courage to face.",

The Internet is not part of daily life; the term \"dot-com\" has yet to be coined; and people's financial bubbles are burst for an entirely different set of reasons. What can all this mean for a young Midwestern man flush with promise, toiling at a thankless, poverty-wage job in corporate America, and hard at work on his first novel about acute knee pain and the end of the world?<br /><br />With <i>The Year of Endless Sorrows</i>, acclaimed playwright and finalist for the 2003 William Saroyan International Prize for Writing Adam Rapp brings readers a hilarious picaresque reminiscent of Nick Hornby, Douglas Copeland, and Rick Moody at their best\u2014a chronicle of the joys of love, the horrors of sex, the burden of roommates, and the rude discovery that despite your best efforts, life may not unfold as you had once planned.",

Daley, politician and self-promoter extraordinaire, from his inauspicious youth on Chicago's South Side through his rapid climb to the seat of power as mayor and boss of the Democratic Party machine. A bare-all account of Daley's cardinal sins as well as his milestone achievements, this scathing work by Chicago journalist Mike Royko brings to life the most powerful political figure of his time: his laissez-faire policy toward corruption, his unique brand of public relations, and the widespread influence that earned him the epithet of \"king maker.\" The politician, the machine, the city--Royko reveals all with witty insight and unwavering honesty, in this incredible portrait of the last of the backroom Caesars.<br /><br />New edition includes an Introduction in which the author reflects on Daley's death and the future of Chicago.",

Since their birth, Rose and Ruby Darlen have been known simply as \"the girls.\" They make friends, fall in love, have jobs, love their parents, and follow their dreams. But the Darlens are special. Now nearing their 30th birthday, they are history's oldest craniopagus twins, joined at the head by a spot the size of a bread plate. <br /><br />When Rose, the bookish sister, sets out to write her autobiography, it inevitably becomes the story of her short but extraordinary life with Ruby, the beautiful one. From their awkward first steps--Ruby's arm curled around Rose's neck, her foreshortened legs wrapped around Rose's hips-- to the friendships they gradually build for themselves in the small town of Leaford, this is the profoundly affecting chronicle of an incomparable life journey.<br /><br />As Rose and Ruby's story builds to an unforgettable conclusion, Lansens aims at the heart of human experience--the hardship of loss and struggles for independence, and the fundamental joy of simply living a life. This is a breath taking novel, one that no reader will soon forget, a heartrending story of love between sisters.",

    "description": "Matilda is a little girl who is far too good to be true. At age five-and-a-half she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Miss (\"The\") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.<br /><br />She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable. Roald Dahl, while keeping the plot moving imaginatively, also has an unerring ear for emotional truth. The reader cares about Matilda because in addition to all her other gifts, she has real feelings.",

    "description": "More than 100 vivid, graphic comparison pictures illustrate every point in this revised classic and can help any photographer maximize the creative impact of his or her exposure decisions. Peterson stresses the importance of metering the subject for a starting exposure, and then explains how to use various exposure meters and different kinds of lighting. The book contains lessons on each element of the exposure-aperature, shutter speed, iso-and how it relates to the other two in terms of depth of field, freezing and blurring action, and shooting in low light or at night. A section on special techniques explores such options as deliberate under- and overexposures, how to produce double exposures, bracketing, shooting the moon, and the use of filters. <i>Understanding Exposure</i> demonstrates that there are always creative choices about how to expose a picture-and that the decision is up to the photographer, not the camera.",

    "description": "Brendan Doyle, a specialist in the work of the early-nineteenth century poet William Ashbless, reluctantly accepts an invitation from a millionaire to act as a guide to time-travelling tourists. But while attending a lecture given by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1810, he becomes marooned in Regency London, where dark and dangerous forces know about the gates in time. Caught up in the intrigue between rival bands of beggars, pursued by Egyptian sorcerers, befriended by Coleridge, Doyle somehow survives. And learns more about the mysterious Ashbless than he could ever have imagined possible.<br /><br />Cover Illustration: Richard Carr",

    "description": "The first free elections in South Africa's history were held in 1994. Within a year legislation was drafted to create a Truth and Reconcilliation Commission to establish a picture of the gross human rights violations committed between 1960 and 1993. It was to seek the truth and make it known to the public and to prevent these brutal events ever happening again. From 1996 and over the following two years South Africans were exposed almost daily to revelations about their traumatic past. Antije Krog's full account of the Commission's work using the testimonies of the oppressed and oppressors alike is a harrowing and haunting book in which the voices of ordinary people shape the course of history.<br /><br />WINNER OF SOUTH AFRICA'S <i>SUNDAY TIMES </i>ALAN PATON AWARD",

    "description": "This classic book on formal languages, automata theory, and computational complexity has been updated to present theoretical concepts in a concise and straightforward manner with the increase of hands-on, practical applications. This new edition comes with Gradiance, an online assessment tool developed for computer science. Gradiance is the most advanced online assessment tool developed for the computer science discipline. With its innovative underlying technology, Gradiance turns basic homework assignments and programming labs into an interactive learning experience for students. By using a series of root questions and hints, it not only tests a student's capability, but actually simulates a one-on-one teacher-student tutorial that allows for the student to more easily learn the material. Through the programming labs, instructors are capable of testing, tracking, and honing their students' skills, both in terms of syntax and semantics, with an unprecedented level of assessment never before offered. For more information about Gradiance, please visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aw.com/gradiance\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.aw.com/gradiance</a>.",

    "description": "In this major work, James D. G. Dunn brings together more than two decades of vigorous and creative work on interpreting the letters of Paul into an integrated, full-scale study of Paul's thought.<br /><br />Using Paul's letter to the Romans as the foundation for constructing a fuller exposition of Paul's whole theology, Dunn's thematic treatment clearly describes Paul's teaching on such topics as God, humankind, sin, christology, salvation, the church, and the Christian life. In the process Dunn engages in a concise way what other important scholars have said regarding each area of inquiry.<br /><br />The Theology of Paul the Apostle represents a major contribution to the ongoing discussion regarding what Paul's theology is and what its continuing relevance is to the study and practice of religion and theology.",

In contrast to other books which are based on the lifecycle model of software development, the authors emphasize identifying and applying fundamental principles that are applicable throughout the software lifecycle. This emphasis enables readers to respond to the rapid changes in technology that are common today. Principles and techniques are emphasized rather than specific tools--users learn why particular techniques should or should not be used. Understanding the principles and techniques on which tools are based makes mastering a variety of specific tools easier. <b> </b> The authors discuss principles such as design, specification, verification, production, management and tools. Now coverage includes: more detailed analysis and explanation of object-oriented techniques; the use of Unified Modeling Language (UML); requirements analysis and software architecture; Model checking--a technique that provides automatic support to the human activity of software verification; GQM--used to evaluate software quality and help improve the software process; Z specification language. <b> </b> For software engineers.",

    "description": "<i>\u201cDaddy and Roger and \u2019em shot \u2019em a nigger.\u201d </i> Those words, whispered to ten-year-old Tim Tyson by a playmate, heralded a ?restorm that would forever transform the tobacco market town of Oxford, North Carolina.<br /><br />On May 11, 1970, Henry Marrow, a twenty-three-year-old black veteran, walked into a crossroads store owned by Robert Teel and came out running. Teel and two of his sons chased and beat Marrow, then killed him in public as he pleaded for his life.<br /><br />Like many small Southern towns, Oxford had barely been touched by the civil rights movement. But in the wake of the killing, young African Americans took to the streets. While lawyers battled in the courthouse, the Klan raged in the shadows and black Vietnam veterans torched the town\u2019s tobacco warehouses. Tyson\u2019s father, the pastor of Oxford\u2019s all-white Methodist church, urged the town to come to terms with its bloody racial history. In the end, however, the Tyson family was forced to move away.<br /><br />Tim Tyson\u2019s riveting narrative of that fiery summer brings gritty blues truth, soaring gospel vision, and down-home humor to a shocking episode of our history. Like <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, <i>Blood Done Sign My Name</i> is a classic portrait of an unforgettable time and place.",

    "description": "With two novels and one short story collection published to overwhelming critical acclaim (\"<b>Monkeys</b> takes your breath away,\" said Anne Tyler; \"heartbreaking, exhilarating,\" raved the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>), Susan Minot has emerged as one of the most gifted writers in America, praised for her ability to strike at powerful emotional truths in language that is sensual and commanding, mesmerizing in its vitality and intelligence. Now, with Evening, she gives us her most ambitious novel, a work of surpassing beauty. During a summer weekend on the coast of Maine, at the wedding of her best friend, Ann Grant fell in love. She was twenty-five. Forty years later--after three marriages and five children--Ann Lord finds herself in the dim claustrophobia of illness, careening between lucidity and delirium and only vaguely conscious of the friends and family parading by her bedside, when the memory of that weekend returns to her with the clarity and intensity of a fever-dream. <b>Evening</b> unfolds in the rushlight of that memory, as Ann relives those three vivid days on the New England coast, with motorboats buzzing and bands playing in the night, and the devastating tragedy that followed a spectacular wedding. Here, in the surge of hope and possibility that coursed through her at twenty-five--in a singular time of complete surrender--Ann discovers the highest point of her life. Superbly written and miraculously uplifting, <b>Evening</b> is a stirring exploration of time and memory, of love's transcendence and of its failure to transcend--a rich testament to the depths of grief and passion, and a stunning achievement.",

He hates waking up to the sound of his father's coughing, the smell of diesel oil, the noise of snow machines starting up.<br /><br />Only Oogruk, the shaman who owns the last team of dogs in the village, understands Russel's longing for the old ways and the songs that celebrated them. But Oogruk cannot give Russel the answers he seeks; the old man can only prepare him for what he must do alone. Driven by a strange, powerful dream of a long-ago self and by a burning desire to find his own song, Russel takes Oogruk's dogs on an epic journey of self-discovery that will change his life forever.A Newbery Honor BookAn ALA Best Book for Young AdultsAn ALA Notable BookA \"School Library Journal\" Best Book",

    "description": "A powerful, sensuous new novel from the critically acclaimed author of 'Evening'. 'Mesmerising.' Vogue 'The bedspread was sloughing off the foot of the bed, the white sheets were as flat as paper. This is not what she'd pictured when she asked him over for lunch today. It really wasn't.' Taking one single interlude -- two bodies entwined on a bed at midday, lovers rekindling an old affair -- Susan Minot's new novel chronicles a relationship from the alternating perspectives of a man and a women. Thoughts cascade through Benjamin's mind, memories of the chest thumping moment when he first met Kay; of the night they shared under the mosquito net on the pink bed in Oaxaca; and of his fiance, Vanessa, and the simple choices that face him. Memories unspool in Kay's mind too. She recalls the dangerous lure of Benjamin, the man who drove her scepticism away; the dread and the thrill of the first night they spent together; and now she asks herself, how has she let him slip back into her life like this? Graphic, provocative and reminiscent of Hanif Kureishi 'Intimacy', Susan Minot's new novel dissects a love affair in breathtaking detail.",

As the young Englishman Stephen Wraysford passes through a tempestuous love affair with Isabelle Azaire in France and enters the dark, surreal world beneath the trenches of No Man's Land, Sebastian Faulks creates a world of fiction that is as tragic as A Farewell to Arms and as sensuous as The English Patient. Crafted from the ruins of war and the indestructibility of love, Birdsong is a novel that will be read and marveled at for years to come.",

    "description": "The #1 bestseller that forever changed how we thought about JFK, published with a new epilogue in time for the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination.<br /><br />When it was originally published in 2003, AN UNFINISHED LIFE brought to light new revelations about JFK's health, his love affairs, his brothers and father, and the path JFK would have taken in the Vietnam entanglement if he had survived. A blockbuster bestseller, the book was embraced by critics and readers as a landmark assessment of our 35th president. Now, in time for what promises to be remarkable media attention on Kennedy's death and legacy, AN UNFINISHED LIFE returns with a new, strikingly incisive examination by Robert Dallek in which he further assesses JFK's impact and hold on American culture.",

    "description": "If the Kennedys are America's royal family, then John F. Kennedy was the nation's crown prince. Magnetic, handsome, and charismatic, his perfectly coifed image overshadowed the successes and failures of his presidency, and his assassination cemented his near-mythological status in American culture and politics. Struck down in his prime, he represented the best and the brightest of America's future, and when he died, part of the nation's promise and innocence went with him. That, at least, is the public version of the story.<br />The private version, according to Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour M. Hersh, is quite different. His meticulous investigation of Kennedy has revealed a wealth of indiscretions and malfeasance, ranging from frequent liaisons with prostitutes and mistresses to the attempted assassination of Fidel Castro to involvement in organized crime. Though scandals in the White House are nothing new, Hersh maintains that Kennedy's activities went beyond minor abuses of power and personal indulgences: they threatened the security of the nation--particularly in the realm of foreign policy--and the integrity of the office. Hersh believes it was only a matter of time before Kennedy's dealings were exposed, and only his popularity and charm, compounded by his premature death, spared such an investigation for so long. Exposure was further stalled by Bobby Kennedy's involvement in nefarious dealings, enabling him to bury any investigation of his brother and--by extension--himself.<p>Based on interviews with former Kennedy administration officials, former Secret Service agents, and hundreds of Kennedy's personal friends and associates, <i>The Dark Side of Camelot</i> rewrites the history of John F. Kennedy and his presidency.</p>",

    "description": "Martin Johnson is the towering second row forward who has come to set the standards of what a professional rugby player should do. His drive and physical presence mean that he is a natural leader on the pitch - and off it, too. In this, his long-awaited autobiography, he looks at the changing world of rugby. He explains why he led the England team to the brink of a strike in the autumn of 2000, and provides the definitive account of England's 2003 World Cup triumph, as well as Lions tours and all the goings-on that make rugby such a special sport. Hugely popular and respected, Martin Johnson has written vivid autobiography and a remarkable portrait of modern rugby.",

During World War I, the U.S. government went on a moral and medical campaign, quarantining and incarcerating young women who were thought to have venereal diseases. They were called \u201ccharity girls\u201d<br /><br />Charity Girl examines one of the darkest periods in our history, when patriotic fervor and fear led to devastating consequences. During World War I, the U.S. government went on a moral and medical campaign, quarantining and incarcerating young women who were thought to have venereal diseases. Most were called \u201ccharity girls,\u201d or working-class girls who happened to have had relationships with infected men. Through the eyes of one fictional charity girl, this novel explores an astonishing time. <br /><br />Frieda Mintz, a Jewish seventeen-year-old bundle wrapper at Jordan Marsh in Boston, spends one impulsive night with an infected soldier. Soon after, she is tracked down and sent to a makeshift detention center, where she is subject to invasive physical exams, poor living conditions, and a creeping erosion of all she thought she knew about herself. Buoying her, though, is a cast of women as strong as they are diverse, and they soon teach one another about dependence, and eventually independence. <br /><br />Charity Girl lays bare an ugly part of our past, when the government exercised a questionable level of authority at the expense of its citizens\u2019 rights. The book casts long shadows and explores the most important, urgent questions of desire, freedom, and identity.",

    "description": "<b>The magnificent second novel from the legendary author of <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i></b> <br /><br /> Following the astonishing success of his first novel, <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i>, Ken Kesey wrote what Charles Bowden calls \"one of the few essential books written by an American in the last half century.\" This wild-spirited tale tells of a bitter strike that rages through a small lumber town along the Oregon coast. Bucking that strike out of sheer cussedness are the Stampers. Out of the Stamper family's rivalries and betrayals Ken Kesey has crafted a novel with the mythic impact of a Greek tragedy.<br /><br />For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",

    "description": "Accused of mocking the inviolate codes of Islam, the Persian poet and sage Omar Khayyam fortuitously finds sympathy with the very man who is to judge his alleged crimes. Recognising genuis, the judge decides to spare him and gives him instead a small, blank book, encouraging him to confine his thoughts to it alone. Thus begins the seamless blend of fact and fiction that is <i>Samarkand</i>. Vividly re-creating the history of the manuscript of the Rubaiyaat of Omar Khayyam, Amin Maalouf spans continents and centuries with breathtaking vision: the dusky exoticism of 11th-century Persia, with its poetesses and assassins; the same country's struggles nine hundred years later, seen through the eyes of an American academic obsessed with finding the original manuscript; and the fated maiden voyage of the Titanic, whose tragedy led to the Rubaiyaat's final resting place - all are brought to life with keen assurance by this gifted and award-winning writer.",

    "description": "Provence, in the south of France, is a part of the world that has been\u2014and continues to be\u2014called a paradise. But one of the lessons that history teaches is that paradise is coveted and fought over. Successive waves of invaders have claimed\u2014or tried to claim\u2014those vineyards, rivers, olive groves, and hills.<br /><br />In Guy Gavriel Kay\u2019s new novel, Ysabel, this duality\u2014of exquisite beauty and violent history\u2014is explored in a work that marks a departure from Kay\u2019s historical fantasies set in various analogues of the past.<br /><br />Ysabel takes place in the world of today: in a modern springtime, in and around the celebrated city of Aix-en-Provence near Marseilles. Dangerous, mythic figures from the Celtic and Roman conflicts of the past erupt into the present, claiming and changing lives.<br /><br />The protagonist is Ned Marriner, the fifteen year-old son of a well-known photographer. Ned has accompanied his father, Edward Marriner, and a team of assistants to Provence for a six week \u201cshoot.\u201d",

    "description": "IN HIS BOOK The 100 Absolutely Unbreakable Laws of Business Success, Brian Tracy drew on his thirty years of experience and knowledge to present a set of principles or \"universal laws\" that lie behind the success of business people everywhere, in every kind of enterprise, large and small. This latest volume, The 21 Success Secrets of Self-Made Millionaires, is made up of entirely new material that shows how anyone, no matter where they are in life at this moment, can become a millionaire.<br /><br />The advice in this book is based on Brian Tracy's twenty-five years of research, teaching, and personal experience on the subject of self-made millionaires. Tracy himself used these ideas to rise from humble beginnings to become a millionaire. And Tracy has discovered that all successful people practice these 21 success secrets, whether they're consciously aware of it or not. In The 21 Success Secrets of Self-Made Millionaires Tracy not only identifies and defines each success secret, but also reveals its source and foundation, illustrates how it functions in the world, and shows how to apply it in life and work through specific steps and practical exercises that everyone can use.<br /><br />Easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to apply, The 21 Success Secrets of Self-Made Millionaires shows how anyone can cultivate the habits and behaviors that will enable them to achieve not just financial independence, but success in any area of life. Because, as Tracy writes, \"The most important part of achieving great success is not the money. It is the kind of person you have to become to earn that money and hold onto it.\"",

    "description": "Perhaps no other of his novels better reveals Giono's perfect balance between lyricism and narrative, description and characterization, the epic and the particular, than <i>The Horseman on the Roof</i>. This novel, which Giono began writing in 1934 and which was published in 1951, expanded and solidified his reputation as one of Europe's most important writers.<br /><br />This is a novel of adventure, a <i>roman courtois</i>, that tells the story of Angelo, a nobleman who has been forced to leave Italy because of a duel, and is returning to his homeland by way of Provence. But that region is in the grip of a cholera epidemic, travelers are being imprisoned behind barricades, and exposure to the disease is almost certain.<br /><br />Angelo's escapades, adventures, and heroic self-sacrifice in this hot, hallucinatory landscape, among corpses, criminals, and rioting townspeople, share this epic tale.",

    "description": "Gypsy Rose Lee\u2019s memoir became a New York Times bestseller in 1957, inspiring the 1959 hit musical, two movies, and three revivals. Now a fourth, directed by Arthur Laurents and starring Patti LuPone, is lighting up New York, winning top Broadway theatre awards, including three 2008 Tony Awards, as well as raves from critics and audiences: <br /><br /><i>\u201cNo matter how long you live, you\u2019ll never see a more exciting production.\u201d \u2014</i>Terry Teachout,<i> The Wall Street Journal </i><br /><br /><i>\u201cWatch out, New York! This GYPSY is a wallop-packing show of raw power.\u201d \u2014</i>Ben Brantley, <i>The New York Times </i><br /><br /><i>\u201cNot your ordinary theater experience. This is the best production of the best damn musical ever.\u201d </i>\u2014Liz Smith, Syndicated Columnist<br /><br />The memoir, which Gypsy began as a series of pieces for <i>The New Yorker, </i>contains photographs and newspaper clippings from her personal scrapbooks and an afterword by her son, Erik Lee Preminger. At turns touching and hilarious, Gypsy describes her childhood trouping across 1920s America through her rise to stardom as The<i> </i>Queen of Burlesque<i> </i>in 1930s New York\u2014where gin came in bathtubs, gangsters were celebrities, and Walter Winchell was king.<br /><br />Gypsy\u2019s story features outrageous characters\u2014among them Broadway\u2019s funny girl, Fanny Brice, who schooled Gypsy in how to be a star; gangster Waxy Gordon, who fixed her teeth; and her indomitable mother, Rose, who lived by her own version of the Golden Rule: \u201cDo unto others \u2026 before they do you.\u201d",

    "description": "\"Compulsive reading.\" -Norman Tebbit, The Sunday Times (London) <br />FORGOTTEN VOICES OF THE GREAT WAR is a touching, searing, and above all mesmerizing account of World War I, told in the voices of those who endured the tedium, heat, cold, pain, fear, and loss of the world's most brutal trench warfare to date. <br />In 1972 the British Imperial War Museum set about the momentous task of tracing ordinary veterans of the First World War and interviewing them in detail about their experiences. The Imperial War Museum Sound Archive, which includes recorded firsthand accounts of the experiences of American, British, Canadian, French, and German soldiers, as well as soldiers from the British Commonwealth, has since grown to be the most important collection of its kind in the world. The archive's recordings provide a vivid and compelling account of day-to-day life during one of the most harrowing periods of modern times. <br />These recordings, many of which have remained unheard for decades, contain the forgotten voices of a generation no longer with us. Only a small fraction of the material has been used by historians. Now, thirty years later, after hundreds of hours in the archive and unlimited access to the complete WWI audiotapes, acclaimed author Max Arthur and his team of researchers have created this remarkable landmark history of the Great War-told in the words of the ordinary men and women who experienced it in the raw. <br />",

    "description": "Muhammad Yunus is that rare thing: a bona fide visionary. His dream is the total eradication of poverty from the world. In 1983, against the advice of banking and government officials, Yunus established Grameen, a bank devoted to providing the poorest of Bangladesh with minuscule loans. Grameen Bank, based on the belief that credit is a basic human right, not the privilege of a fortunate few, now provides over 2.5 billion dollars of micro-loans to more than two million families in rural Bangladesh. Ninety-four percent of Yunus's clients are women, and repayment rates are near 100 percent. Around the world, micro-lending programs inspired by Grameen are blossoming, with more than three hundred programs established in the United States alone. <br /><br /><i>Banker to the Poor</i> is Muhammad Yunus's memoir of how he decided to change his life in order to help the world's poor. In it he traces the intellectual and spiritual journey that led him to fundamentally rethink the economic relationship between rich and poor, and the challenges he and his colleagues faced in founding Grameen. He also provides wise, hopeful guidance for anyone who would like to join him in \"putting homelessness and destitution in a museum so that one day our children will visit it and ask how we could have allowed such a terrible thing to go on for so long.\" The definitive history of micro-credit direct from the man that conceived of it, Banker to the Poor is necessary and inspirational reading for anyone interested in economics, public policy, philanthropy, social history, and business. <br /><br /> Muhammad Yunus was born in Bangladesh and earned his Ph.D. in economics in the United States at Vanderbilt University, where he was deeply influenced by the civil rights movement. He still lives in Bangladesh, and travels widely around the world on behalf of Grameen Bank and the concept of micro-credit.",

There are a few clues. A frame of microfilm surgically implanted beneath the flesh of his hip. Evidence that plastic surgery has altered his face. Strange things that he says in his delirium -- maybe code words. Initial: \"J.B.\" And a number on the film negative that leads to a Swiss bank account, a fortune of four million dollars, and, at last, a name: Jason Bourne.<p>But now he is marked for death, caught in a maddening puzzle, racing for survival through the deep layers of his buried past into a bizarre world of murderous conspirators -- led by Carlos, the world's most dangerous assassin.</p><p>And no one can help Jason Bourne but the woman who once wanted to escape him.</p><p></p>",

    "description": "No career in modern American letters is at once so brilliant, varied, and controversial as that of Norman Mailer. In a span of more than six decades, Mailer has searched into subjects ranging from World War II to Ancient Egypt, from the march on the Pentagon to Marilyn Monroe, from Henry Miller and Mohammad Ali to Jesus Christ. Now, in <i>The Castle in the Forest,</i> his first major work of fiction in more than a decade, Mailer offers what may be his consummate literary endeavor: He has set out to explore the evil of Adolf Hitler. <br /><br />The narrator, a mysterious SS man who is later revealed to be an exceptional presence, gives us young Adolf from birth, as well as Hitler\u2019s father and mother, his sisters and brothers, and the intimate details of his childhood and adolescence.<br /><br />A tapestry of unforgettable characters, <i>The Castle in the Forest</i> delivers its playful twists and surprises with astonishing insight into the nature of the struggle between good and evil that exists in us all. At its core is a hypothesis that propels this novel and makes it a work of stunning originality. Now, on the eve of his eighty-fourth birthday, Norman Mailer may well be saying more than he ever has before.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "Novelist Roddy Doyle, with his legendary skill in illuminating ordinary experience, here shares the story of his parents' lives, largely in their own words. Born in 1923 and 1925, respectively, married in 1951, Rory and Ita Doyle remember the details of their Dublin childhoods and their life together-the people and the politics, the joys and the losses-and show us the transformation of the intensely Catholic society of their youth into the vibrant modern Ireland of today. By turns poignant, wry, hilarious, and sweet but never sentimental, <i>Rory &amp; Ita</i> is an account of the moments that make up two intertwined lives and a book of tremendous warmth and humanity. It offers a whole new look at Doyle's heritage and source of inspiration.",

    "description": "In this masterful debut by a major new voice in fiction, Jon Clinch takes us on a journey into the history and heart of one of American literature\u2019s most brutal and mysterious figures: Huckleberry Finn\u2019s father. The result is a deeply original tour de force that springs from Twain\u2019s classic novel but takes on a fully realized life of its own.<br /><br /><i>Finn</i> sets a tragic figure loose in a landscape at once familiar and mythic. It begins and ends with a lifeless body\u2013flayed and stripped of all identifying marks\u2013drifting down the Mississippi. The circumstances of the murder, and the secret of the victim\u2019s identity, shape Finn\u2019s story as they will shape his life and his death.<br /><br />Along the way Clinch introduces a cast of unforgettable characters: Finn\u2019 s terrifying father, known only as the Judge; his sickly, sycophantic brother, Will; blind Bliss, a secretive moonshiner; the strong and quick-witted Mary, a stolen slave who becomes Finn\u2019s mistress; and of course young Huck himself. In daring to re-create Huck for a new generation, Clinch gives us a living boy in all his human complexity\u2013not an icon, not a myth, but a real child facing vast possibilities in a world alternately dangerous and bright.<br /><br /><i>Finn </i>is a novel about race; about paternity in its many guises; about the shame of a nation recapitulated by the shame of one absolutely unforgettable family. Above all, <i>Finn</i> reaches back into the darkest waters of America\u2019s past to fashion something compelling, fearless, and new.",

    "description": "Every kid thinks about running away at one point or another; few get farther than the end of the block. Young Sam Gribley gets to the end of the block and keeps going--all the way to the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York. There he sets up house in a huge hollowed-out tree, with a falcon and a weasel for companions and his wits as his tool for survival. In a spellbinding, touching, funny account, Sam learns to live off the land, and grows up a little in the process. Blizzards, hunters, loneliness, and fear all battle to drive Sam back to city life. But his desire for freedom, independence, and adventure is stronger. No reader will be immune to the compulsion to go right out and start whittling fishhooks and befriending raccoons. <p> Jean Craighead George, author of more than 80 children's books, including the Newbery Medal-winning <i>Julie of the Wolves</i>, created another prizewinner with <i>My Side of the Mountain</i>--a Newbery Honor Book, an ALA Notable Book, and a Hans Christian Andersen Award Honor Book. Astonishingly, she wrote its sequel, <i>On the Far Side of the Mountain</i>, 30 years later, and a decade after that penned the final book in the trilogy, <i>Frightful's Mountain</i>, told from the falcon's point of view. George has no doubt shaped generations of young readers with her outdoor adventures of the mind and spirit. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>",

    "description": "In Othello, Shakespeare creates a powerful drama of a marriage that begins with fascination (between the exotic Moor Othello and the Venetian lady Desdemona), with elopement, and with intense mutual devotion and that ends precipitately with jealous rage and violent deaths. He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean, moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello's African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine\u2014differences of race, of age, of cultural background\u2014that one should not, perhaps, be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello's standard-bearer, Iago, who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago's insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful, fascination\u2014which dominates the early acts of the play\u2014turns to horror, especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago's schemes; of an innocent Desdemona, who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults, the outcome of Othello's mistaken convictions about her faithlessness.",

    "description": "<b>Delve into <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, Nathaniel Hawthorne's meditation on human alienation and its effect on the soul in this story set in seventeenth-century Massachusetts and be dazzled by literature.</b><br /><br /> In Nathaniel Hawthorne's dark novel, <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, <b>a single sinful act ruins the lives of three people</b>. None more so than Hester Prynne, a young, beautiful, and dignified woman, who conceived a child out of wedlock and receives the public punishment of having to always wear <b>a scarlet \"A\" on her clothing</b>.<br /><br /> She refuses to reveal the father of her child, which could lighten her sentence. Her husband, the aptly-named Roger Chillingworth, who Hester thought had died in a shipwreck but was actually being held captive by Native Americans, <b>arrives at the exact moment</b> of her deepest public shaming and vows to get <b>revenge</b>. Her lover, Arthur Dimmesdale, remains safely unidentified, but is wracked with guilt.<br /><br /> Though originally published in 1850, the story is <b>set in seventeenth-century Massachusetts</b> among Hawthorne's Puritan ancestors. In <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, he created a story that <b>highlighted both their weaknesses and their strengths</b>. His knowledge of their beliefs and his admiration for their way of life was balanced by his concerns about their rigid and oppressive rules.<br /><br /><b>Complete and unabridged</b>, this elegantly designed, clothbound edition features an elastic closure and a new introduction by Mike Lee Davis.",

    "description": "The finest of all Conrad's tales, <em>Heart of Darkness</em> is set in an atmosphere of mystery and menace, and tells of Marlow's perilous journey up the Congo River to relieve his employer's agent, the renowned and formidable Mr. Kurtz. What he sees on his journey, and his eventual encounter with Kurtz, horrify and perplex him, and call into question the very bases of civilization and human nature. Endlessly reinterpreted by critics and adapted for film, radio, and television, the story shows Conrad at his most intense and sophisticated. The other three tales in this volume depict corruption and obsession, and question racial assumptions. Set in the exotic surroundings of Africa, Malaysia, and the east, they variously appraise the glamour, folly, and rapacity of imperial adventure. This revised edition uses the English first edition texts and has a new chronology and bibliography.",

    "description": "<b>\n  <i>When I opened the door of the flat there was a picture postcard lying in the hallway. It showed a reproduction of a painting by Joan Mir\u00f3. I turned the card over. Neatly written, in green ink, was what appeared to be a date and time: 20 May\u201311:00. There was no explanatory message, no indication of who had written the card. The printed details told me that the reproduction was entitled \u201cWoman of the Night.\u201d The painting could be found at the Mir\u00f3 Foundation. May 20 was the next day.<br /></i>\n  <br /></b><br />Lucas, a musician and translator living in Barcelona\u2019s Gothic Quarter, comes home one day to find this cryptic invitation. When he appears at the appointed time, he sets in motion a series of bizarre, seemingly interconnected events that disrupt his previously passive existence. He meets the alluring Nuria and they begin an intense love affair. He is approached by a band of Barcelona\u2019s mythic roof dwellers and has a run-in with a fire-eating prophet. <br /><br />But when he and Nuria are kidnapped by a religious cult with roots stretching back to the thirteenth-century, Lucas realizes that his life is spinning out of control. The cult\u2019s megalomaniac leader, Pontneuf, maintains that Nuria and Lucas are essential to his plan to revive the religion. While Nuria is surprisingly open to Pontneuf and his theories, Lucas is outraged and makes his escape. Back in Barcelona, Lucas wanders the streets in a drug-and-alcohol induced haze, pining for Nuria and struggling to make sense of what happened to him. He recounts his improbable adventures to his friends, who are wholly entertained by the story and deeply dubious of its truth, an understandable skepticism as Lucas fast becomes the quintessential unreliable narrator. <br /><br /><br />With the alluring and enchanting Barcelona as a vibrant backdrop, <i>The Color of a Dog Running Away</i> is a love story, tale of adventure and historical thriller all rolled into one unforgettable and mesmerizing package; a novel that will beguile and disturb in equal measure.",

    "description": "What if you didn't believe in God, but then met the Devil? That is precisely the dilemma in the mysterious tale of Gideon Mack. <br /><br />A good man, and, ironically, a good minister despite his atheism, Mack leads a respectable and well-intentioned life in a small Scottish town. There he dutifully tends to his flock and even raises a small fortune for Christian charity running marathons. but the life he has constructed is shattered when Mack falls down a local ravine - known as the Black Jaws - and into the raging river below. Presumed drowned, he resurfaces three days later, bruised but alive. Even more unbelievable, Mack emerges from the waters claiming to have been rescued and cared for by the Devil in an underground cave.<br /><br />Suspended from the church, mocked by the tabloids and shunned as a madman, Gideon eventually disappears. The case is forgotten until a publisher received what appears to be Gideon's memoir of his experience with teh Devil and of the unusual life that precedes it.<br /><br />Himself the son of a minister, Mack grew up in a joyless household under his father's repressive thumb until a fateful clash over his watching an episode of Batman on the sabbath sets him free -- or so he thinks. Decades later while on a job in the woods, Mack's life is upended when he discovered a monolithic stone that he swears wasn't there the day before. Its mysterious - and possibly supernatural - appearance sets off the chain of events that leads to his fantastic encounter. <br /><br />Mixing realism and legend with a wealth of insight into faith, mortality and human behavior, The Testament of Gideon Mack is a mesmerizing and brilliantly imagined novel where perception must be questioned and truth lurks in the shadows.",

    "description": "From acclaimed novelist Mark Helprin, a lush, literary epic about love, beauty, and the world at war.<br /><br />Alessandro Giuliani, the young son of a prosperous Roman lawyer, enjoys an idyllic life full of privilege: he races horses across the country to the sea, he climbs mountains in the Alps, and, while a student of painting at the ancient university in Bologna, he falls in love. Then the Great War intervenes. Half a century later, in August of 1964, Alessandro, a white-haired professor, tall and proud, meets an illiterate young factory worker on the road. As they walk toward Monte Prato, a village seventy kilometers away, the old man\u2014a soldier and a hero who became a prisoner and then a deserter, wandering in the hell that claimed Europe\u2014tells him how he tragically lost one family and gained another. The boy, envying the richness and drama of Alessandro's experiences, realizes that this magnificent tale is not merely a story: it's a recapitulation of his life, his reckoning with mortality, and above all, a love song for his family.",

A note instructs him to see a Dr. Randle immediately, who informs him that he is undergoing yet another episode of acute memory loss that is a symptom of his severe dissociative disorder. Eric's been in Dr. Randle's care for two years -- since the tragic death of his great love, Clio, while the two vacationed in the Greek islands.<br /><br />But there may be more to the story, or it may be a different story altogether. As Eric begins to examine letters and papers left in the house by \"the first Eric Sanderson,\" a staggeringly different explanation for what is happening to Eric emerges, and he and the reader embark on a quest to recover the truth and escape the remorseless predatory forces that threatens to devour him.<br /><br /><i>The Raw Shark Texts</i> is a kaleidoscopic novel about the magnitude of love and the devastating effect of losing that love. It will dazzle you, it will move you, and will leave an indelible imprint like nothing you have read in a long time.",

He tells of the Nazi cult of the primeval German forest; the play of Christian and pagan myth in Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers; and the duel between a monumental sculptor and a feminist gadfly on the slopes of Mount Rushmore. The result is a triumphant work of history, naturalism, mythology, and art. <br /><br />\"A work of great ambition and enormous intellectual scope...consistently provocative and revealing.\"--New York Times<br /><br />\"Extraordinary...a summary cannot convey the riches of this book. It will absorb, instruct, and fascinate.\"--New York Review of Books",

    "description": "In 1855, Charlotte Bronte penned a 20-page fragment telling the story of a child of an apparently wealthy family, who is enrolled with great ceremony at a local ladies' school. But the girl's wealth and standing are illusory, as the school discovers when term bills go unpaid and the girl's father proves to be nonexistent. It is here that author Boylan takes up the story. The question of the girl's origins proves to be a stone thrown into a much larger Victorian pond. A local gentleman, Mr. Ellin, takes up the investigation, which leads him from the most posh clubs in London to the cesspools of the city's lowest quarters; the shocking secrets which come out of it will change his life, and everyone else's, forever.",

    "description": "The love story of Emperor Jahangir and Mehrunnisa, begun in the critically praised debut novel <i>The Twentieth Wife</i>, continues in Indu Sundaresan's <i>The Feast of Roses</i>. This lush new novel tells the story behind one of the great tributes to romantic love and one of the seven wonders of the world -- the Taj Mahal.<br /><br />Mehrunnisa, better known as Empress Nur Jahan, comes into Jahangir's harem as his twentieth and last wife. Almost from the beginning of her royal life she fits none of the established norms of womanhood in seventeenth-century India.<br /><br />Mehrunnisa is the first woman Jahangir marries for love, at the \"old\" age of thirty-four. He loves her so deeply that he eventually transfers his powers of sovereignty to her.<br /><br />Power and wealth do not come easily to Mehrunnisa -- she has to fight for them. She has a formidable rival in the imperial harem, Empress Jagat Gosini, who has schemed and plotted against Mehrunnisa from early on. Mehrunnisa's problems do not just lie within the harem walls, but at court, too, as she battles powerful ministers for supremacy. These ministers, who have long had Emperor Jahangir's confidence and trust, consider Mehrunnisa a mere woman who cannot have a voice in the outside world.<br /><br />Mehrunnisa combats all of this by forming a <i>junta</i> of sorts with three men she can rely on -- her father, her brother, and Jahangir's son Prince Khurram. She demonstrates great strength of character and cunning to get what she wants, sometimes at a cost of personal sorrow when she almost loses her daughter's love. But she never loses the love of the man who bestows this power upon her -- Emperor Jahangir. The Feast of Roses is a tale of this power and love, the story of power behind a veil.",

Instinct proves reliable. A murderous sociopath, Edgler Foreman Vess, has entered the house, intent on killing everyone inside. A self-proclaimed \"homicidal adventurer,\" Vess lives only to satisfy all appetites as they arise, to immerse himself in sensation, to live without fear, remorse or limits, to live with \"intensity.\" Chyna is trapped in his deadly orbit. <br />Chyna is a survivor, toughened by a lifelong struggle for safety and self-respect. Now she will be tested as never before. At first her sole aim is to get out alive--until, by chance, she learns the identity of Vess's next intended victim, a faraway innocent only she can save. Driven by a newly discovered thirst for meaning beyond mere self-preservation, Chyna musters every inner resource she has to save an endangered girl...as moment by moment, the terrifying threat of Edgler Foreman Vess intensifies.",

    "description": "\"The Sun Also Rises\" was Ernest Hemingway's first big novel, and immediately established Hemingway as one of the great prose stylists, and one of the preeminent writers of his time. It is also the book that encapsulates the angst of the post-World War I generation, known as the Lost Generation. This poignantly beautiful story of a group of American and English expatriates in Paris on an excursion to Pamplona represents a dramatic step forward for Hemingway's evolving style. Featuring Left Bank Paris in the 1920s and brutally realistic descriptions of bullfighting in Spain, the story is about the flamboyant Lady Brett Ashley and the hapless Jake Barnes. In an age of moral bankrupcy, spiritual dissolution, unrealized love, and vanishing illustions, this is the Lost Generation.",

    "description": "When Haitians tell a story, they say \"Krik?\" and the eager listeners answer \"Krak!\" In <b>Krik? Krak!</b> In her second novel, Edwidge Danticat establishes herself as the latest heir to that narrative tradition with nine stories that encompass both the cruelties and the high ideals of Haitian life. They tell of women who continue loving behind prison walls and in the face of unfathomable loss; of a people who resist the brutality of their rulers through the powers of imagination. The result is a collection that outrages, saddens, and transports the reader with its sheer beauty.",

    "description": "We meet him late in life: a quiet man, a good father and husband, a fixture in his Brooklyn neighborhood, a landlord and barber with a terrifying scar across his face. As the book unfolds, moving seamlessly between Haiti in the 1960s and New York City today, we enter the lives of those around him, and learn that he has also kept a vital, dangerous secret. Edwidge Danticat's brilliant exploration of the \"dew breaker\"\u2014or torturer\u2014is an unforgettable story of love, remorse, and hope; of personal and political rebellions; and of the compromises we make to move beyond the most intimate brushes with history. It firmly establishes her as one of America's most essential writers.",

    "description": "At age 24 Jamie Zeppa, a Canadian who had never been outside of North America, said goodbye to her fianc\u00e9 and her plans for graduate school and moved to Bhutan, a remote Buddhist kingdom in the Himalayas. <br /><br /><i>Beyond the Sky and the Earth</i> is an autobiographical work that details her experiences and transformations after spending three years in Bhutan. It is as much a book about Zeppa's day-to-day life in Bhutan as it is about the personal awakenings and realizations that she had while living there. <br /><br />Visitors to Bhutan, an increasingly hot tourist destination, are still few and far between, largely because of tight government restrictions on entry, visa requirements, and a law requiring tourists to spend at least $200 a day there. There aren't many books on Bhutan, and even fewer first-hand accounts of life there. <i>Beyond the Sky and the Earth</i> stands out as both an informative introduction to the people and culture of Bhutan and as a beautiful piece of travel literature set against the backdrop of one of the most remote and unspoiled places on earth. <br /><br />Zeppa recounts her experiences living abroad, such as learning to live without electricity and carrying on a forbidden affair with one of her students, in such a compelling way that even someone who has never left home will become entranced by her story and captivated by her unique experiences. <br /><br />Naturally, Zeppa experienced culture shock when she arrived in Bhutan. The hardships she encountered seemed insurmountable, and at first she thought she couldn't bear it and fantasized about returning to Canada. She had to learn a new language in order to communicate with her students, she had to learn to live on her own, and she had to learn to deal with homesickness. Perhaps her biggest challenge was learning how to reconcile her growing love for Bhutan with her nostalgia for her life in Canada, her family, and her fianc\u00e9. But after living among Bhutan's Himalayan peaks, lush valleys, colorful villages, and friendly people, and after gaining an appreciation for life in a place frozen in time, Zeppa realizes that she feels at home in Bhutan and wants to stay.<br /><br />Although to Zeppa Bhutan is a magical land, she cautions herself and the reader not to deem it \"the last Shangri-La,\" as is often done by the lucky travelers who make their way through the red tape required for entry into the kingdom. Bhutan is not without its problems: it is an underdeveloped country plagued by the problems that affect many places cut off from modernity. There is infant mortality, illness, and poverty. There are also domestic and international tensions that stem from the government's stringent regulations intended to preserve the national culture. Among them are the prohibition of foreign television and a requirement that people wear the national dress, a kira for women and a gho for men.<br /><br />Few of us will ever get to see the place that was Zeppa's home. But her narrative is so clear and insightful that you easily feel as though you are sharing this portion of her life with her. Even if you haven't had the experience of living abroad, or if the prospect of a trip to the furthest reaches of Asia is not in your cards, Zeppa's book is a worthy read on many levels. <br /><br />From her powerful use of language to describe the superb beauty of Bhutan's landscape to her passionate description of her spellbinding relationship with her future husband, <i>Beyond the Sky and the Earth</i> draws readers in and takes them on her rocky ride to self-realization. <br /><br />When trying to explain to a friend what she finds appealing about Bhutan, Zeppa writes: \"It takes a long time to find the true words, to put them in order, to tell the whole story. It is not just this or that, the mountains, the people, it is me and the way I can be here, the freedom to walk unafraid into the great dark night. It is a hundred thousand things and I could never trace or tell all the connections and reflections, the shadows and echoes and secret relations between them.\"<br /><br />But, in fact, Zeppa does tell the reader about these connections and reflections in a lyrical way. After reading the book, you will have a deep understanding, appreciation, and respect for Zeppa's strength of character and for the wonders of Bhutan.<br /><br /><i>Beyond the Sky and the Earth</i> is a delight to read in every way. Zeppa's beautiful prose, peppered alternately with funny observations and profound soul-searching, is a truly special and unique work that will leave you craving an adventure of your own.",

    "description": "With each and every new novel, Dean Koontz raises the stakes--and the pulse rate--higher than any other author. Now, in what may be his most suspenseful and heartfelt novel ever, he brings us the story of an ordinary man whose extraordinary commitment to his wife will take him on a harrowing journey of adventure, sacrifice, and redemption to the mystery of love itself--and to a showdown with the darkness that would destroy it forever. <br />What would you do for love? Would you die? Would you kill? <br />We have your wife. You can get her back for two million cash. Landscaper Mitchell Rafferty thinks it must be some kind of joke. He was in the middle of planting impatiens in the yard of one of his clients when his cell phone rang. Now he's standing in a normal suburban neighborhood on a bright summer day, having a phone conversation out of his darkest nightmare. <br />Whoever is on the other end of the line is dead serious. He has Mitch's wife and he's named the price for her safe return. The caller doesn't care that Mitch runs a small two-man landscaping operation and has no way of raising such a vast sum. He's confident that Mitch will find a way. <br />If he loves his wife enough. . . Mitch does love her enough. He loves her more than life itself. He's got seventy-two hours to prove it. He has to find the two million by then. But he'll pay a lot more. He'll pay anything. <br />From its tense opening to its shattering climax, The Husband is a thriller that will hold you in its relentless grip for every twist, every shock, every revelation...until it lets you go, unmistakably changed. This is a Dean Koontz novel, after all. And there's no other experience quite like it.",

    "description": "Though we routinely take to the air, for many of us flying remains a mystery. Few of us understand the how and why of jetting from New York to London in six hours. How does a plane stay in the air? Can turbulence bring it down? What is windshear? How good are the security checks? Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and author of Salon.com's popular column, \"Ask the Pilot,\" unravels the secrets and tells you all there is to know about the strange and fascinating world of commercial flight. He offers:<br /><br /><br />A nuts and bolts explanation of how planes fly Insights into safety and security Straight talk about turbulence, air traffic control, windshear, and crashes The history, color, and controversy of the world's airlines The awe and oddity of being a pilot The poetry and drama of airplanes, airports, and traveling abroad<br />In a series of frank, often funny explanations and essays, Smith speaks eloquently to our fears and curiosities, incorporating anecdotes, memoir, and a life's passion for flight. He tackles our toughest concerns, debunks conspiracy theories and myths, and in a rarely heard voice dares to return a dash of romance and glamour to air travel.",

    "description": "Vernon Culligan had been dead to the town of Draydon, Virginia, so long that when the crusty Vietnam vet finally died, only one person noticed. Twelve-year-old Gabe grew up in the foster care system until a social worker located his Uncle Vernon two years before. When he comes home to discover that his uncle has died of a heart attack, he's terrifed of going back into the system--so he tells no one. The next day, he discovers a strange note in his mailbox: I HAVE A SECRET. DO NOT BE AFRAID. And his uncle's body is gone. <br /><br />Thus begins a unique correspondence destined to save the two people that depended on Vernon for everything. Through flashbacks, we learn about Gabe and Vernon's relationship, and how finding each other saved them both from lives of suffering. But eventually, Vernon's death will be discovered, and how will Gabe and the mystery note writer learn to move forward? THE MAILBOX is not a story about death--though it begins with a death. It's also not a story about Vietnam vets, although the author works with Vietnam veterans and wrote this novel, in part, to illuminate their sacrifices and suffering. THE MAILBOX is a story about connections--about how two people in need can save each other.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

A compulsive gambler and brilliant mathematician prone to crippling epileptic seizures, he possesses the uncanny ability to calculate odds of any hand in the blink of an eye. But one night at an underground poker club, Caine makes a costly misscalculation, sending his life spinning out of control. Desperate, he agrees to test an experimental drug with unnerving side effects: inexplicable visions of the past, present, and future. Unsure whether he's perceiving an alternate reality or suffering a psychotic breakdown, Caine embarks on a journey that stretches beyond the possible into the world of the improbable. Gradually, he discovers the extent of his astonishing new ability -- but powerful, shadowy forces know Caine's secret. Now Caine must fight for his survival -- and his sanity . . .",

    "description": "<i>Of Mice and Men</i> was John Steinbeck's first masterpiece. Originally published in 1937, it's the timeless story of George Milton and Lennie Small, ranch hands who drift from job to job, always one step ahead of the law and a few dollars from the poorhouse. George is small, wiry, sharp-tongued and quick-tempered; slow witted Lennie is his opposite\u2014an immense man, brutishly strong but naturally docile, a giant with the mind of a child. Despite their difference, George and Lennie are bound together by a shared vision: their own small farm, where they'll raise cows, pigs, chickens, and rabbits, where they'll be their own bosses and live off the fat of the land.<br /><br />When they find work on a ranch in California's Salinas Valley, the dream at last seems within reach. If they can just save up a little money. . . . But their hopes, like \"the best-laid schemes of mice and men,\" begin to go awry. The story unfolds with the power and inevitability of a Greek tragedy, as Lennie commits an accidental murder, and George, in a riveting, deeply moving finale, must do what he can to make things turn our right.",

It is a series of science fiction books by Orson Scott Card. The series started with the novelette \"Ender's Game\", which was later expanded into the novel Ender's Game. It currently consists of eleven novels and ten short stories. The first two novels in the series, Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead, each won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, and were among the most influential science fiction novels of the 1980s.\n    \n    Also See <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/40409-ender-s-shadow\">Ender's Shadow</a> parallel series and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/72732-the-first-formic-war\">The First Formic War</a> prequel series.\n    \n    For the entire Ender's Universe in Chronological Order, see <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/119216-the-enderverse-chronological-order\">The Enderverse (Chronological Order)</a>.\n    \n    First Meetings in Ender's Universe is a collection of 3 Short Stories, and the original Ender's Game Novella.

    "description": "From a beloved and bestselling master of speculative fiction comes this chilling tale of a soulful loner who must overcome demons from his past -- and the demons he unwittingly unleashes -- when he starts renovating a faded Southern mansion. As Homebody eloquently proves, no contemporary writer outshines Orson Scott Card in crafting unlikely heroes or in suffusing the everyday world with an otherworldly glow.<br />Don Lark's cheery name belies his tragic past. When his alcoholic ex-wife killed their daughter in a car wreck, he retreated from the sort of settled, sociable lifestyle one takes for granted. Only the prospect of putting a roof over other people's heads seems to comfort Lark, and he goes from town to town, looking for dilapidated houses he can buy, restore and resell at a profit. In Greensboro, North Carolina, Lark finds his biggest challenge yet -- a huge, sturdy, gorgeous shell that's suffered almost a century of abuse at the hands of greedy landlords and transient tenants. As he sinks his teeth into this new project, Lark's new neighborhood starts to work its charms on him. He strikes up a romance with the wry real estate agent who sold him the house. His neighbors, two charming, chatty old ladies, ply him endlessly with delicious Southern cooking. Even Sylvie, the squatter Lark was once desperate to evict from the old house, is now growing on him.<br /><br />But when Lark unearths an old tunnel in the cellar, the house's enchantments start to turn ominous. Sylvie turns cantankerous, even dangerous. There's still a steady supply of food from next door, but it now comes laced with increasingly passionate pleas for Lark to vacate the house at once. In short, everybody seems to want to get rid of him. Whether this is for his own good or theirs, Lark digs in his heels for reasons even he's not sure of. He embarks on a struggle for his life -- and his friends'-- against a house with a past even more tragic than his own. If Lark wins, he gets the kind of home and community he's always dreamed of. If he loses, all is lost....",

    "description": "Guatemalan diplomat and writer Miguel Angel Asturias (1899\u20131974) began this award-winning work while still a law student. It is a story of a ruthless dictator and his schemes to dispose of a political adversary in an unnamed Latin American country usually identified as Guatemala. The book has been acclaimed for portraying both a totalitarian government and its damaging psychological effects. Drawing from his experiences as a journalist writing under repressive conditions, Asturias employs such literary devices as satire to convey the government\u2019s transgressions and surrealistic dream sequences to demonstrate the police state\u2019s impact on the individual psyche. Asturias\u2019s stance against all forms of injustice in Guatemala caused critics to view the author as a compassionate spokesperson for the oppressed. My work,\u201d Asturias promised when he accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature, \u201cwill continue to reflect the voice of the people, gathering their myths and popular beliefs and at the same time seeking to give birth to a universal consciousness of Latin American problems.\u201d",

Virtually self-taught, he excelled as an athlete, a man of letters, a printer, a scientist, a wit, an inventor, an editor, and a writer, and he was probably the most successful diplomat in American history. David Hume hailed him as the first great philosopher and great man of letters in the New World. </p><p>Written initially to guide his son, Franklin's autobiography is a lively, spellbinding account of his unique and eventful life. Stylistically his best work, it has become a classic in world literature, one to inspire and delight readers everywhere.</p>",

    "description": "\"Book Two of The Prince of Nothing\" finds the Holy War continuing its inexorable march southward. But the suspicion begins to dawn that the real threat comes not from the infidel but from within...Steering souls through the subtleties of word and expression, Kellhus strives to extend his dominion over the Men of the Tusk. The sorcerer Achamian and his lover, Esmenet, submit entirely, only to have their faith - and their love - tested in unimaginable ways. Meanwhile, the warrior Cnaiur falls ever deeper into madness. Convinced that Kellhus will betray their pact to murder his father, Cnaiur turns to the agents of the Second Apocalypse and strikes an infernal bargain. The Holy War stands on a knife edge. If all is not to be lost, the great powers of the world will have to choose between their most desperate desires and the end of the world. Between hatred and hope. Between Anasurimbor Kellhus and the second apocalypse.",

The third book has been referred to as The Book That Shall Not Be Named by Bakker, since the title of this book is considered to be a spoiler for the preceding volumes.",

A pioneering advocate of the infant science of cryonics, he has arranged to have his body frozen until the day when humanity will possess the knowledge, the technology, and the courage to revive him. <br /><br />Yet when Ben resumes life after a frozen interval of eighty-three years, the world is altered beyond recognition. Thanks to cutting-edge science, eternal youth is universally available and the perfection of cloning gives humanity the godlike power to re-create living beings from a single cell. As Ben and his family are resurrected in the mid-twenty-first century, they experience a complex reunion that reaches through generations--and discover that the deepest ethical dilemmas of humankind remain their greatest challenge. . . .",

In the course of his epic and enlightening journey, he endures danger, delay, and dismaying circumstances.<br /><br />Gauging the state of affairs, he talks to Africans, aid workers, missionaries, and tourists. What results is an insightful mediation on the history, politics, and beauty of Africa and its people.<br /><br />In a new postscript, Theroux recounts the dramatic events of a return to Africa to visit Zimbabwe.",

    "description": "This collection of important stories by novelist, journalist, teacher, and Palestinian activist Ghassan Kanafani includes the stunning novella Men in the Sun (1962), the basis of the The Deceived. Also in the volume are \"The Land of Sad Oranges\" (1958), \"'If You Were a Horse...'\" (1961), \"A Hand in the Grave\" (1962), \"The Falcon\" (1961), \"Letter from Gaza\" (1956), and an excerpt from Umm Saad (1969). In the unsparing clarity of his writing, Kanafani offers the reader a gritty look at the agonized world of Palestine and the adjoining Middle East.<br /><br />Born in Acre (northern Palestine) in 1936, Ghassan Kanafani was a major spokesman for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and founding editor of its weekly magazin Al-Hadaf. His novels, short stories, and plays have been published in sixteen languages. He was killed in a car-bomb explosion in Beirut in 1972.",

    "description": "<b>The Barnes Noble Review</b><br /><br />Dark mysticism and primordial natural magic clash with the ever-expanding boundaries of the \"civilized\" world in the second volume of Robin Hobb's Soldier Son trilogy, <i>Forest Mage</i>. <br /><br />The sequel to 2005's <i>Shaman's Crossing</i> finds protagonist Nevare Burvelle -- the second son of a nobleman and destined for a career in the military -- with his world turned upside down. After surviving a plague that wiped out many of the students and instructors at the king's military academy, Nevare returns home for his brother's wedding, only to learn that he has been medically discharged from the school. The plague usually leaves its survivors skeletally thin, but Nevare, inexplicably, has begun to gain massive amounts of weight. With his family believing he's a glutton, Nevare is disowned by his father and eventually ends up finding work as a lowly cemetery guard in a frontier town near the border with the Specks, a race of dapple-skinned forest dwellers who possess powerful natural magic. But in a world where technology never stops advancing, can the Specks survive? And what does the suddenly bloated Nevare have to do with their struggle?<br /><br />Set in a sprawling, vividly described realm that is as majestic as it is menacing, and powered by some extremely topical themes (environmentalism, cultural homogenization, human rights, religious persecution, etc.), the Soldier Son trilogy is easily Hobb's most significant work to date. Incorporating elements of military fantasy, New Age spirituality, and political allegory, <i>Forest Mage</i> can be faulted only for suffering from a serious case of middle-volume syndrome: As the second installment of a trilogy, it lacks both a true beginning and a satisfactory ending. All will be forgotten, however, when the concluding volume (tentatively entitled <i>Renegade Magic</i>) of this unique and powerfully moving saga is released in 2007. <i>Paul Goat Allen</i>",

    "description": "The young scholar Archimedes has just had the best three years of his life at Ptolemy's Museum at Alexandria. To be able to talk and think all day, every day, sharing ideas and information with the world's greatest minds, is heaven to Archimedes. But heaven must be forsaken when he learns that his father is ailing, and his home city of Syracuse is at war with the Romans.<br /><br />Reluctant but resigned, Archimedes takes himself home to find a job building catapults as a royal engineer. Though Syracuse is no Alexandria, Archimedes also finds that life at home isn't as boring or confining as he originally thought. He finds fame and loss, love and war, wealth and betrayal-none of which affects him nearly as much as the divine beauty of mathematics.",

For only on that sprawling continent--a haven for misfits of both the animal and human kingdoms--could a nervous Anglican minister who gambles on the instructions of the Divine become allied with a teenaged heiress who buys a glassworks to help liberate her sex. And only the prodigious imagination of Peter Carey could implicate Oscar and Lucinda in a narrative of love and commerce, religion and colonialism, that culminates in a half-mad expedition to transport a glass church across the Outback.",

In the summer, Dillard stalks muskrats in the creek and contemplates wave mechanics; in the fall she watches a monarch butterfly migration and dreams of Arctic caribou. She tries to con a coot; she collects pond water and examines it under a microscope. She unties a snake skin, witnesses a flood, and plays 'King of the Meadow' with a field of grasshoppers.",

By addressing the horror of the Holocaust through cartoons, the author captures the everyday reality of fear and is able to explore the guilt, relief and extraordinary sensation of survival - and how the children of survivors are in their own way affected by the trials of their parents. A contemporary classic of immeasurable significance.",

    "description": "The Cajun coast of Louisiana is home to a way of life as unique, complex, and beautiful as the terrain itself.\u00a0 As award-winning travel writer Mike Tidwell journeys through the bayou, he introduces us to the food and the language, the shrimp fisherman, the Houma Indians, and the rich cultural history that makes it unlike any other place in the world. But seeing the skeletons of oak trees killed by the salinity of the groundwater, and whole cemeteries sinking into swampland and out of sight, Tidwell also explains why each introduction may be a farewell\u2014as the storied Louisiana coast steadily erodes into the Gulf of Mexico.<br /><br />Part travelogue, part environmental expos\u00e9, <i>Bayou Farewell</i> is the richly evocative chronicle of the author's travels through a world that is vanishing before our eyes.",

Along the way, he meets an unforgettable generation of boy soldiers, brigands, street toughs and charming, willful girls\u2014all struggling for survival in the aftermath of natural catastrophe magnified by political callousness and brutal neglect.<br /><br />Peter Behrens transports the reader to another time and place for a deeply-moving and resonant experience. <i>The Law of Dreams</i> is gorgeously written in incandescent language that unleashes the sexual and psychological energies of a lost world while plunging the reader directly into a vein of history that haunts the ancestral memory of millions in a new millennium.",

Halpin now turns his unique talent to an unforgettable account of the pursuit of his true calling: teaching.<br /><br /><i>Losing My Faculties</i> follows Halpin through teaching jobs in an economically depressed white ethnic town, a middle-class suburb, a last-chance truancy prevention program in the inner city, and an ambitious college-prep urban charter school. In the same cuttingly observant voice that marked <i>It Takes a Worried Man</i>, Halpin tells us what it really means to be a teacher\u2014the ups and downs in the classroom, the battles with administrators and colleagues, and the joy of doing a job that matters. Not the tale of a hero who changes his troubled students\u2019 lives in one year, <i>Losing My Faculties</i> is, rather, the story of an all-too-fallible teacher who persists in spite of the frustrations that have driven so many others from the profession. After nine years of teaching, Halpin \ufb01nds his idealism in shreds but his sense of humor and love for his work blessedly intact.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "The critically acclaimed <i>New York Times</i> bestselling account of how the modern Middle East came into being after World War I, and why it is in upheaval today<br /><br />In our time the Middle East has proven a battleground of rival religions, ideologies, nationalisms, and dynasties. All of these conflicts, including the hostilities between Arabs and Israelis that have flared yet again, come down, in a sense, to the extent to which the Middle East will continue to live with its political inheritance: the arrangements, unities, and divisions imposed upon the region by the Allies after the First World War.<br /><br />In <i>A Peace to End All Peace</i>, David Fromkin reveals how and why the Allies came to remake the geography and politics of the Middle East, drawing lines on an empty map that eventually became the new countries of Iraq, Israel, Jordan, and Lebanon. Focusing on the formative years of 1914 to 1922, when all-even an alliance between Arab nationalism and Zionism-seemed possible he raises questions about what might have been done differently, and answers questions about why things were done as they were. The current battle for a Palestinian homeland has its roots in these events of 85 years ago.<br />",

    "description": "\"The object of life is impossible; one cuts out fabrication and creates reality. A mirror is held to the back of the head and one's hand has to move the opposite way from what was intended.\"<br /><br />In these closing lines from Impossible Object, one has embodied both Nicholas Mosley's subject of love and imagination, as well as his unmatched lyric style. In eight carefully connected stories that are joined by introspective interludes on related subjects, the author pursues the notion, through the lives of a couple seen by different narrators, that \"those who like unhappy ends can have them, and those who don't will have to look for them.\"<br /><br />The impossible object of the title, \"the triangle that can exist in two dimensions but not in three,\" is a controlling symbol for the impossibility of realizing the good life unless one recognizes the impossibility of attaining it: only then can it be possible to realize it, through a kind of renunciation, especially in \"a sophisticated, corrupt, chaotic world.\" Such a provocative theme, comic or tragic by turns, was met by critics in 1968 as brilliant, insightful, intense, and moving, but especially original.",

Pierson's puppeteers, the aliens who discovered it, are understandably wary of encountering the builders of such an immense structure and have assembled a team of two humans, a mad puppeteer and a kzin, a huge cat-like alien, to explore it. But a crash landing on the vast edifice forces the crew on a desperate and dangerous trek across the Ringworld.",

    "description": "\"A man who has attained mastery of an art reveals it in his every action.\"--<i>Samurai Maximum</i>.<br /><br />Under the guidance of such celebrated masters as Ed Parker and the immortal Bruce Lee, Joe Hyams vividly recounts his more than 25 years of experience in the martial arts. In his illuminating story, Hyams reveals to you how the daily application of Zen principles not only developed his physical expertise but gave him the mental discipline to control his personal problems-self-image, work pressure, competition. Indeed, mastering the spiritual goals in martial arts can dramatically alter the quality of your life-enriching your relationships with people, as well as helping you make use of all your abilities.",

    "description": "On August 5, 1949, a crew of fifteen of the United States Forest Service's elite airborne firefighters, The Smoke Jumpers, stepped into the sky above a remote forest fire in the Montana wilderness. Two hours after their jump, all but three of these men were dead or mortally burned from a <i>\"blowup\"</i> -- an explosive, 2,000-degree firestorm 300 feet deep and 200 feet tall -- a deadly explosion of flame and wind rarely encountered and little understood at the time.\u00a0 Only seconds ahead of the approaching firestorm, the foreman, R. Wagner Dodge, throws himself into the ashes of an <i>\"escape fire \"</i> - and survives as most of his confused men run, their last moments obscured by smoke. The parents of the dead cry murder, charging that the foreman's fire killed their boys.\u00a0 Exactly what happened in Mann Gulch that day has been obscured by years of grief and controversy. Now a master storyteller finally gives the Mann Gulch fire its due as tragedy.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These first deaths among the Forest Service's elite firefighters prompted widespread examination of federal fire policy, of the field of fire science, and of the frailty of young men. For Maclean, who witnessed the fire from the ground in August of 1949,\u00a0 and even then he knew he would one day become a part of its story.\u00a0 It is a story of Montana, of the ways of wildfires, firefighters, and fire scientists, and especially of a crew, young and proud, who <i>\"hadn't learned to count the odds and to sense they might owe the universe a tragedy.\"</i> This tale is also Maclean's own, the story of a writer obsessed by a strange and human horror, unable to let the truth die with these young men, searching for the last - and lasting - word. A canvas on which to tell many stories, including the story of his research into the story itself. And finally Nature's violence colliding with human fallibility.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Haunted by these deaths for forty years, Norman Maclean returned to the scene with two of the survivors and pursues the mysteries that Mann Gulch has kept hidden since 1949.\u00a0 From the words of witnesses, the evidence of history, and the research of fire scientists, Maclean at last assembles the scattered pieces of the Mann Gulch tragedy; in his last work that consumed 14 years of his life, and earned a 1992 National Book Critics Circle Award.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The excruciating detail of this book makes for a sobering reading experience. Maclean -- a former University of Chicago English professor and avid fisherman -- also wrote <u>\n  <em>A River Runs Through It and Other Stories</em>\n</u>, which is set along the Missouri River, one gulch downstream from Mann Gulch.<br /><br /><i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"A magnificent drama of writing, a tragedy that pays tribute to the dead and offers rescue to the living.... Maclean's search for the truth, which becomes an exploration of his own mortality, is more compelling even than his journey into the heart of the fire. His description of the conflagration terrifies, but it is his battle with words, his effort to turn the story of the 13 men into tragedy that makes this book a classic.\"</i>\u00a0<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 from <i>New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice, Best Books of 1992</i><br /><br /><u>\n  <i>The Men who Perished in the Mann Gulch Fire:</i>\n</u><br />Robert J.

    "description": "New York Times best-selling author Neil Gaiman's transcendent series SANDMAN is often hailed as the definitive Vertigo title and one of the finest achievements in graphic storytelling. Gaiman created an unforgettable tale of the forces that exist beyond life and death by weaving ancient mythology, folklore and fairy tales with his own distinct narrative vision.<br /><br />In PRELUDES &amp; NOCTURNES, an occultist attempting to capture Death to bargain for eternal life traps her younger brother Dream instead. After his 70 year imprisonment and eventual escape, Dream, also known as Morpheus, goes on a quest for his lost objects of power. On his arduous journey Morpheus encounters Lucifer, John Constantine, and an all-powerful madman.<br /><br />This book also includes the story \"The Sound of Her Wings,\" which introduces us to the pragmatic and perky goth girl Death.<br /><br />Includes issues 1-8 of the original series.",

While our dad was upstairs broadcasting something to the world, and we were listening in, or trying to find his frequency and listen to his voice . . . we would give up and go out in the snow with a phone rigged with alligator clips so we could listen in on others\u2019 conversations. There\u2019s something nearly sexual about this, hearing what other people are saying to their lovers, children, cousins, psychics, pastors. . . .</i><br /><br />The cumulative effect of this stunningly original collection seems to work on the reader in the same way\u2014we follow glimpses of dispossessed lives in the snow-buried reaches of Michigan\u2019s Keweenaw Peninsula, where nearly everyone seems to be slipping away under the ice to disappear forever. Through an unsettling, almost crazed gestalt of sketches, short stories, lists, indices and radio schematics, Monson presents a world where weather, landscape, radio waves and electricity are characters in themselves, affecting a community held together by the memories of those they have lost.<br /><br /><b>Ander Monson</b> is the editor of <i>DIAGRAM</i> and the New Michigan Press. He teaches at Grand Valley State University and lives in Michigan. Tupelo Press recently published his poetry collection, <i>Elegies for Descent and Dreams of Weather</i>.",

But when Mr. Bikferd falls in love with Pretzel Annie, the prophecy of an old homeless woman comes true: \u201cWho needs donuts when you\u2019ve got love?\u201d Mr. Bikferd bequeaths his donut collection to Sam, who uses it to save the old homeless woman from drowning in a basement flooded with coffee. <br /><br />This is a reissue of Mark Alan Stamaty\u2019s masterpiece of the absurd, first published 30 years ago and out of print nearly as long. With an illustration style that mixes a benign Hieronymus Bosch with an urban <i>Where\u2019s Waldo?</i>, Stamaty\u2019s off-the-wall humor is on target for little kids and big kids today.",

    "description": "He has been called the most trusted man in America. His 60-year-long journalistic career has spanned the Great Depression, several wars, and the extraordinary changes that have engulfed our nation over the last two-thirds of the 20th century. When Walter Cronkite advised his television audience in 1968 that the war in Vietnam could not be won, President Lyndon B. Johnson said: \"If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost middle America.\"<br /><br />Now, at the age of eighty, Cronkite has written his life story--the personal and professional odyssey of the original \"anchorman\" for whom that very word was coined. As a witness to the crucial events of this century--first for the <b>Houston Press</b>, then for the <b>United Press</b> wire service, and finally for <b>CBS</b> in the fledgling medium of television--Cronkite set a standard for integrity, objectivity, enthusiasm, compassion, and insight that is difficult to surpass. He is an overflowing vessel of history, and a direct link with the people and places that have defined our nation and established its unique role in the world.<br /><br />But Walter Cronkite is also the man who loved to drive race cars \"for the same reason that others do exhibitionist, dangerous stunts. It sets us apart from the average man; puts us, in our own minds, on a level just a little above the chap who doesn't race.\" He is also the man whose \"softheartedness knows no rational bounds\" and who always had \"great problems at the theater, tearing up at the slightest offense against animals and people, notably the very old or the very young.\" He is the man who could barely refrain from spitting on the defendants at the Nuremberg Trials, and who could barely announce President Kennedy's assassination over the air for the sobs in his throat.<br /><br />Walter Cronkite helped launch the juggernaut of television, and tried to imbue it with his own respect for quality and ethics; but now he occupies a ringside seat during the decline of his profession and the ascent of the lowest common denominator. As he aptly observes, \"They'd rewrite Exodus to include a car chase.\" <br /><br />Still, the American people know the difference. They know that for decades they have had the privilege of getting their news from a gentleman of the highest caliber. And they will immensely enjoy <b>A Reporter's Life.</b>",

    "description": "In 2025, with the world descending into madness and anarchy, one woman begins a fateful journey toward a better future<br /><br />Lauren Olamina and her family live in one of the only safe neighborhoods remaining on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Behind the walls of their defended enclave, Lauren\u2019s father, a preacher, and a handful of other citizens try to salvage what remains of a culture that has been destroyed by drugs, disease, war, and chronic water shortages. While her father tries to lead people on the righteous path, Lauren struggles with hyperempathy, a condition that makes her extraordinarily sensitive to the pain of others.<br /><br />When fire destroys their compound, Lauren\u2019s family is killed and she is forced out into a world that is fraught with danger. With a handful of other refugees, Lauren must make her way north to safety, along the way conceiving a revolutionary idea that may mean salvation for all mankind.",

And they are being stalked by a lone wolf, Morgra, possessed of a mysterious and terrifying power known as the Sight. Morgra knows that one of the pups born beneath the castle holds a key to power even stronger than her own power that could give her control of this world and the next. But the pack she hunts will do anything to protect their own, even if it means setting in motion a battle that will involve all of nature, including the creature the wolves fear the most: Man.",

Together, they will embark on a breathtaking journey to the most exotic locale on earth, where the greatest mystery of ancient Egypt, a chilling danger, and an explosive passion are waiting.<br /><br />Steeped in ancient mystery, drama, and action, <i>The Seventh Scroll</i> will pull you in for an adventure of a lifetime.<br />",

    "description": "<b>The Pulitzer Prize-nominated novel from the author of the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling novel <i>We Were the Mulvaneys</i></b><br /><br />Joyce Carol Oates has taken a shocking story that has become an American myth and, from it, has created a novel of electrifying power and illumination. Kelly Kelleher is an idealistic, twenty-six-year-old \u201cgood girl\u201d when she meets the Senator at a Fourth of July party. In a brilliantly woven narrative, we enter her past and her present, her mind and her body as she is fatally attracted to this older man, this hero, this soon-to-be-lover. Kelly becomes the very embodiment of the vulnerable, romantic dreams of bright and brave women, drawn to the power that certain men command\u2014at a party that takes on the quality of a surreal nightmare; in a tragic car ride that we hope against hope will not end as we know it must end. One of the acknowledged masters of American fiction, Joyce Carol Oates has written a bold tour de force that parts the black water to reveal the profoundest depths of human truth.",

    "description": "From the bestselling author of Tenth of December comes a splendid new edition of his acclaimed collaboration with the illustrator behind The Stinky Cheese Man and James and the Giant Peach! Featuring fifty-two haunting and hilarious images, The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip is a modern fable for people of all ages that touches on the power of kindness, generosity, compassion, and community.<br /><br />In the seaside village of Frip live three families: the Romos, the Ronsens, and a little girl named Capable and her father. The economy of Frip is based solely on goat\u2019s milk, and this is a problem because the village is plagued by gappers: bright orange, many-eyed creatures the size of softballs that love to attach themselves to goats. When a gapper gets near a goat, it lets out a high-pitched shriek of joy that puts the goats off giving milk, which means that every few hours the children of Frip have to go outside, brush the gappers off their goats, and toss them into the sea. The gappers have always been everyone\u2019s problem, until one day they get a little smarter, and instead of spreading out, they gang up: on Capable\u2019s goats. Free at last of the tyranny of the gappers, will her neighbors rally to help her? Or will they turn their backs, forcing Capable to bear the misfortune alone?<br /><br />Featuring fifty-two haunting and hilarious illustrations by Lane Smith and a brilliant story by George Saunders that explores universal themes of community and kindness, The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip is a rich and resonant story for those that have all and those that have not.<br /><br />Praise for The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip<br /><br />\u201cIn a perfect world, every child would own a copy of this profound, funny fable. . . . Every adult would own a copy too, and would marvel at how this smart, subversive little book is even deeper and more hilarious than any child could know.\u201d\u2014Entertainment Weekly<br /><br />\u201cSaunders\u2019s idiosyncratic voice makes an almost perfect accompaniment to children\u2019s book illustrator Smith\u2019s heightened characterizations and slightly surreal backdrops.\u201d\u2014Publishers Weekly<br /><br />\u201cA riveting, funny, and sly new fairy tale.\u201d\u2014Miami Herald",

    "description": "A fascinating tale of murder, intrigue, and betrayal. A gripping hour-by-hour account told through the eyes of the hunted and the hunters, this is history as you've never read it before.<br /><br />The murder of Abraham Lincoln set off the greatest manhunt in American history -- the pursuit and capture of John Wilkes Booth. From April 14 to April 26, 1865, the assassin led Union cavalry and detectives on a wild twelve-day chase through the streets of Washington, D.C., across the swamps of Maryland, and into the forests of Virginia, while the nation, still reeling from the just-ended Civil War, watched in horror and sadness. <br /><br />At the very center of this story is John Wilkes Booth, America's notorious villain. A Confederate sympathizer and a member of a celebrated acting family, Booth threw away his fame and wealth for a chance to avenge the South's defeat. For almost two weeks, he confounded the manhunters, slipping away from their every move and denying them the justice they sought. <br /><br />Based on rare archival materials, obscure trial transcripts, and Lincoln's own blood relics, Manhunt is a fully documented work, but it is also a fascinating tale of murder, intrigue, and betrayal. A gripping hour-by-hour account told through the eyes of the hunted and the hunters, this is history as you've never read it before.",

    "description": "The <i>enfant terrible</i> of French letters, Jean-Nicholas-Arthur Rimbaud (1854-91)\u00a0was a defiant and precocious youth who wrote some of the most remarkable prose and poetry of the nineteenth century, all before leaving the world of verse by the age of twenty-one. More than a century after his death, the young rebel-poet continues to appeal to modern readers as much for his turbulent life as for his poetry; his stormy affair with fellow poet Paul Verlaine and his nomadic adventures in eastern Africa are as iconic as his hallucinatory poems and symbolist prose.<br /><br />The first translation of the poet's complete works when it was published in 1966, <i>Rimbaud: Complete Works, Selected Letters</i> introduced a new generation of Americans to the alienated genius\u2014among them the Doors's lead singer Jim Morrison, who wrote to translator Wallace Fowlie to thank him for rendering the poems accessible to those who \"don't read French that easily.\" Forty years later, the book remains the only side-by-side bilingual edition of Rimbaud's complete poetic works.<br /><br />Thoroughly revising Fowlie's edition, Seth Whidden has made changes on virtually every page, correcting errors, reordering poems, adding previously omitted versions of poems and some letters, and updating the text to reflect current scholarship; left in place are Fowlie's literal and respectful translations of Rimbaud's complex and nontraditional verse. Whidden also provides a foreword that considers the heritage of Fowlie's edition and adds a bibliography that acknowledges relevant books that have appeared since the original publication. On its fortieth anniversary, <i>Rimbaud</i> remains the most authoritative\u2014and now, completely up-to-date\u2014edition of the young master's entire poetic ouvre.",

His finest work is \"Ficciones\" (1944), a collection of brilliantly-crafted, essay-like short stories. This edition, updated from the original 1976 edition by the same authors, offers a comprehensive selection of stories from the work with a full introduction, detailed notes, a generous vocabulary, bibliography, as well as chronological and other tables.",

    "description": "Like other great nineteenth-century novels - The Scarlet Letter, Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary - Machado de Assis's Dom Casmurro explores the themes of marriage and adultery. But what distinguishes Machado's novel from the realism of its contemporaries, and what makes it such a delightful discovery for English-speaking readers, is its eccentric and wildly unpredictable narrative style. Far from creating the illusion of an orderly fictional \"reality, \" Dom Casmurro is told by a narrator who is disruptively self-conscious, deeply subjective, and prone to all manner of marvelous digression. As he recounts the events of his life from the vantage of a lonely old age, Bento continually interrupts his story to reflect on the writing of it: he examines the aptness of an image or analogy, considers cutting out certain scenes before taking the manuscript to the printer, and engages in a running, and often hilarious, dialogue with the reader. But the novel is more than a performance of stylistic acrobatics. It is an ironic critique of Catholicism, in which God appears as a kind of divine accountant whose ledgers may be balanced in devious as well as pious ways. It is also a story about love and its obstacles, about deception and self-deception, and about the failure of memory to make life's beginning fit neatly into its end. First published in 1900, Dom Casmurro is one of the great unrecognized classics of the turn of the century by one of Brazil's greatest writers. Newly translated and edited by John Gledson, with an afterword by Joao Adolfo Hansen, this Library of Latin America edition is the only complete, unabridged, and annotated translation available of one of the most distinctive novels ofthe last century.",

    "description": "Everything is rational in capitalism, except capital or capitalism itself. The stock market is certainly rational; one can understand it, study it, capitalists know how to use it, and yet it is completely delirious, it is mad. That's why we say: the rational always is the rationality of an irrational. Marx is fascinated by capitalist mechanisms precisely because the system is demented, yet works very well at the same time. Down below, there are investments of desire that cannot be confused with the investments of interest: all kinds of libidinous-unconscious flows that make up the delirium of this society. The true history is the history of desire.\"This collection of essays and interviews edited by Sylvere Lotringer and published in 1995, focuses on the French anti-psychiatrist and theorist's work as director of the experimental La Borde clinic (\"A Clinic Unlike Any Other\") and longtime collaborator with the philosopher Gilles Deleuze.\"Chaosophy\" is a groundbreaking introduction to Guattari's theories on \"schizo-analysis\" a process meant to replace Freudian interpretation with a more pragmatic, experimental, and collective approach rooted in reality. Unlike Freud, Guattari believes that schizophrenia is an extreme mental state induced by the capitalist system itself, which keeps enforcing neurosis as a way of maintaining normality. Guattari's post-Marxist vision of capitalism provides a new definition not only of mental illness, but also of the micropolitical means of its subversion.This collection contains key essays, such as, \"Balance-Sheet Program for Desiring-Machines\" and \"Capitalism and Schizophrenia,\" co-signed by Deleuze (with whom he co-authored \"Anti-Oedipus\" and \"A Thousand Plateaus\"), and the perennially provocative \"Everybody Wants To Be a Fascist.",

This was the series that helped introduce into English such characters as Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, Paul Virilio, Michel Foucault, and most famously in the Semiotext(e) lineage, Jean Baudrillard. With more recent introductions of such names as the Italian Franco \"Bifo\" Berardi and Paolo Virno, and the German Peter Sloterdijk, this series is now, for all intents and purposes, Semiotext(e)'s \"Theory\" series.\n    \n    <em>The MIT Press</em>",

    "description": "Hailed by The Comics Journal as one of Europe\u2019s most important and innovative comics artists, David B. has created a masterpiece in Epileptic, his stunning and emotionally resonant autobiography about growing up with an epileptic brother. Epileptic gathers together and makes available in English for the first time all six volumes of the internationally acclaimed graphic work.<br /><br />David B. was born Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Beauchard in a small town near Orl\u00e9ans, France. He spent an idyllic early childhood playing with the neighborhood kids and, along with his older brother, Jean-Christophe, ganging up on his little sister, Florence. But their lives changed abruptly when Jean-Christophe was struck with epilepsy at age eleven. In search of a cure, their parents dragged the family to acupuncturists and magnetic therapists, to mediums and macrobiotic communes. But every new cure ended in disappointment as Jean-Christophe, after brief periods of remission, would only get worse.<br /><br />Angry at his brother for abandoning him and at all the quacks who offered them false hope, Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois learned to cope by drawing fantastically elaborate battle scenes, creating images that provide a fascinating window into his interior life. An honest and horrifying portrait of the disease and of the pain and fear it sowed in the family, Epileptic is also a moving depiction of one family\u2019s intricate history. Through flashbacks, we are introduced to the stories of Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois\u2019s grandparents and we relive his grandfathers\u2019 experiences in both World Wars. We follow Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois through his childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, all the while charting his complicated relationship with his brother and Jean-Christophe\u201ds losing battle with epilepsy. Illustrated with beautiful and striking black-and-white images, Epileptic is as astonishing, intimate, and heartbreaking as the best literary memoir.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "Between the classic films of Walt Disney in the 1940s and the televised cartoon revolution of the 1960s was a critical period in the history of animation. Amid Amidi, of the influential <i>Animation Blast</i> magazine and CartoonBrew blog, charts the evolution of the modern style in animation, which largely discarded the \"lifelike\" aesthetic for a more graphic and often abstract approach. Abundantly found in commercials, industrial and educational films, fair and expo infotainment, and more, this quickly popular cartoon modernism shared much with the painting and graphic design movements of the era. Showcasing hundreds of rare and forgotten sketches, model boards, cels, and film stills, <i>Cartoon Modern</i> is a thoroughly researched, eye-popping, and delightful account of a vital decade of animation design.",

    "description": "<b>A surprising assessment of the failures and successes of modern Japan.</b><br /><br />In <i>Dogs and Demons</i>, Alex Kerr chronicles the many facets of Japan's recent, and chronic, crises -- from the failure of its banks and pension funds to the decline of its once magnificent modern cinema. He is the first to give a full report on the nation's endangered environment -- its seashores lined with concrete, its roads leading to nowhere in the mountains -- as well as its \"monument frenzy,\" the destruction of old cities such as Kyoto and construction of drab new ones, and the attendant collapse of its tourist industry. Kerr writes with humor and passion, for \"passion,\" he says, \"is part of the story. Millions of Japanese feel as heartbroken at what is going on as I do. My Japanese friends tell me, 'Please write this -- for us.'\"",

    "description": "Masculinity without men. In Female Masculinity Jack Halberstam takes aim at the protected status of male masculinity and shows that female masculinity has offered a distinct alternative to it for well over two hundred years. Providing the first full-length study on this subject, Halberstam catalogs the diversity of gender expressions among masculine women from nineteenth-century pre-lesbian practices to contemporary drag king performances.<p>Through detailed textual readings as well as empirical research, Halberstam uncovers a hidden history of female masculinities while arguing for a more nuanced understanding of gender categories that would incorporate rather than pathologize them. He rereads Anne Lister's diaries and Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness as foundational assertions of female masculine identity. He considers the enigma of the stone butch and the politics surrounding butch/femme roles within lesbian communities. He also explores issues of transsexuality among \"transgender dykes\"---lesbians who pass as men---and female-to-male transsexuals who may find the label of \"lesbian\" a temporary refuge. Halberstam also tackles such topics as women and boxing, butches in Hollywood and independent cinema, and the phenomenon of male impersonators.</p><p>Female Masculinity signals a new understanding of masculine behaviors and identities, and a new direction in interdisciplinary queer scholarship. Illustrated with nearly forty photographs, including portraits, film stills, and drag king performance shots, this book provides an extensive record of the wide range of female masculinities. And as Halberstam clearly demonstrates, female masculinity is not some bad imitation of virility, but a lively and dramatic staging of hybrid and minority genders.</p>",

    "description": "This is the story of the rise to national power of a desperately poor young man from the Texas Hill Country. The Path to Power reveals in extraordinary detail the genesis of the almost superhuman drive, energy, and ambition that set LBJ apart. It follows him from the Hill Country to New Deal Washington, from his boyhood through the years of the Depression to his debut as Congressman, his heartbreaking defeat in his first race for the Senate, and his attainment, nonetheless, at age 31, of the national power for which he hungered. In this book, we are brought as close as we have ever been to a true perception of political genius and the American political process.<br /><br />Means of Ascent, Book Two of The Years of Lyndon Johnson, was a number one national best seller and, like The Path to Power, received the National Book Critics Circle Award.",

    "description": "Hortense Joseph arrives in London from Jamaica in 1948 with her life in her suitcase, her heart broken, her resolve intact. Her husband, Gilbert Joseph, returns from the war expecting to be received as a hero, but finds his status as a black man in Britain to be second class. His white landlady, Queenie, raised as a farmer's daughter, befriends Gilbert, and later Hortense, with innocence and courage, until the unexpected arrival of her husband, Bernard, who returns from combat with issues of his own to resolve. <br /><br />Told in these four voices, <i>Small Island </i>is a courageous novel of tender emotion and sparkling wit, of crossings taken and passages lost, of shattering compassion and of reckless optimism in the face of insurmountable barriers---in short, an encapsulation of the immigrant's life.<br />",

    "description": "From Andrea Levy, author of <i>Small Island</i> and winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year and the Best of the Best Orange Prize, comes a story of one woman and two islands.<br /><br />Faith Jackson knows little about her parents' lives before they moved to England. Happy to be starting her first job in the costume department at BBC television, and to be sharing a house with friends, Faith is full of hope and expectation. But when her parents announce that they are moving \"home\" to Jamaica, Faith's fragile sense of her identity is threatened. Angry and perplexed as to why her parents would move to a country they so rarely mention, Faith becomes increasingly aware of the covert and public racism of her daily life, at home and at work.<br /><br />At her parents' suggestion, in the hope it will help her to understand where she comes from, Faith goes to Jamaica for the first time. There she meets her Aunt Coral, whose storytelling provides Faith with ancestors, whose lives reach from Cuba and Panama to Harlem and Scotland. Branch by branch, story by story, Faith scales the family tree, and discovers her own vibrant heritage, which is far richer and wilder than she could have imagined.<br /><br /><i>Fruit of the Lemon</i> spans countries and centuries, exploring questions of race and identity with humor and a freshness, and confirms Andrea Levy as one of our most exciting contemporary novelists.",

    "description": "At a time when relations between the United States and Europe are at their lowest ebb since World War II, this brief but cogent book is essential reading. Robert Kagan, a leading scholar of American foreign policy, forces both sides to see themselves through the eyes of the other. Europe, he argues, has moved beyond power into a self-contained world of laws, rules, and negotiation, while America operates in a \u201cHobbesian\u201d world where rules and laws are unreliable and military force is often necessary.<br /><br />Tracing how this state of affairs came into being over the past fifty years and fearlessly exploring its ramifications for the future, Kagan reveals the shape of the new transatlantic relationship. The result is a book that promises to be as enduringly influential as Samuel Huntington\u2019s <b>The Clash of Civilizations. </b>",

Whether they know it or not, Baxter's characters are floating above an abyss of unruly desire, inexplicable dread, unforeseen tragedy, and sudden moments of grace.<br /><br />A drunken graduate student hurtles cheerfully through a snowstorm to rescue a fiancee who no longer wants him. A hospital maintenance worker makes a perverse bid for his place in the sunlight of celebrity. A man and a woman who have lost their only child cling fiercely to the one thing they have left of her--their grief. Lit by the quiet lightning of Baxter's prose, <b>Through the Safety Net</b> is filled with rare artistry and feeling.",

    "description": "This is the story of the man without whom the name Charles Darwin might be unknown to us today. That man was Captain Robert FitzRoy, who invited the 22-year-old Darwin to be his companion on board the <em>Beagle</em> .<br /><br />This is the remarkable story of how a misguided decision by Robert FitzRoy, captain of HMS <em>Beagle</em> , precipitated his employment of a young naturalist named Charles Darwin, and how the clash between FitzRoy\u2019s fundamentalist views and Darwin\u2019s discoveries led to FitzRoy\u2019s descent into the abyss.<br /><br />One of the great ironies of history is that the famous journey\u2014wherein Charles Darwin consolidated the earth-rattling \u2018origin of the species\u2019 discoveries\u2014was conceived by another man: Robert FitzRoy. It was FitzRoy who chose Darwin for the journey\u2014not because of Darwin\u2019s scientific expertise, but because he seemed a suitable companion to help FitzRoy fight back the mental illness that had plagued his family for generations. Darwin did not give FitzRoy solace; indeed, the clash between the two men\u2019s opposing views, together with the ramifications of Darwin\u2019s revelations, provided FitzRoy with the final unendurable torment that forced him to end his own life.",

Her welcoming committee in Palermo includes a most unlikely CIA agent and several unseen enemies. Unfriendly eyes also observe Mrs. P's rendezvous with Farrell in a secluded mountain village and weapons are soon displayed. With mysterious forces hot after them, she and Farrell scurry for safety to a fortified country villa, where the bizarre chatelaine, once a star on Madison Avenue, is almost as unnerving as the dangers she's protecting them from.",

The twin threads of bright and dark, love and cruelty, hope and despair intertwine in a pattern as significant as it is enduring.<br /><br />Along with <i>Emily Climbs</i> and <i>Emily\u2019s Quest</i>, <i>Emily of New Moon</i> insightfully portrays the beauty and anguish of growing up.",

Suddenly, a series of crib deaths\u2014indistinguishable from SIDS except for the fevered testimony of one distraught mother with connections in high places\u2014draws the attention of the police and the national media and raises the possibility of the inconceivable: could there be a serial infant murderer on the loose? <br /><br />Orphaned as a child, out of place as an adult, gifted with delicate and terrifying powers of intuition, Lena finds herself playing a critical role in the case. But then there is the mystery of her own childhood to solve....Could the improbable deaths of a half-dozen babies be somehow connected to her own improbable survival? <br /><br />The beauty and originality of Diana Abu-Jaber's writing are here accompanied by deft, page-turning narrative tension and atmosphere, tugging the reader to an unforgettable conclusion.",

    "description": "Emily Dickinson, probably the most loved and certainly the greatest of American poets, continues to be seen as the most elusive. One reason she has become a timeless icon of mystery for many readers is that her developmental phases have not been clarified. In this exhaustively researched biography, Alfred Habegger presents the first thorough account of Dickinson's growth-a richly contextualized story of genius in the process of formation and then in the act of overwhelming production.<br /><br />Building on the work of former and contemporary scholars, <b> My Wars Are Laid Away in Books</b> brings to light a wide range of new material from legal archives, congregational records, contemporary women's writing, and previously unpublished fragments of Dickinson's own letters. Habegger discovers the best available answers to the pressing questions about the poet: Was she lesbian? Who was the person she evidently loved? Why did she refuse to publish and why was this refusal so integral an aspect of her work? Habegger also illuminates many of the essential connection sin Dickinson's story: between the decay of doctrinal Protestantism and the emergence of her riddling lyric vision; between her father's political isolation after the Whig Party's collapse and her private poetic vocation; between her frustrated quest for human intimacy and the tuning of her uniquely seductive voice.<br /><br />The definitive treatment of Dickinson's life and times, and of her poetic development, <b>My Wars Are Laid Away in Books</b> shows how she could be both a woman of her era and a timeless creator. Although many aspects of her life and work will always elude scrutiny, her living, changing profile at least comes into focus in this meticulous and magisterial biography.<br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their druid, which gives the recipient superhuman strength. The protagonist, the titular character, Asterix, along with his friend Obelix have various adventures.\n    \n    The Asterix series is one of the most popular Franco-Belgian comics in the world, with the series being translated into over 100 languages, and it is popular in most European countries. Asterix is less well known in the United States and Japan.\n    \n    The success of the series has led to the adaptation of several books into 11 films; eight animated, and three with live actors. There have also been a number of games based on the characters, and a theme park near Paris, Parc Ast\u00e9rix, is themed around the series.",

    "description": "In this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life journey of John Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second president of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as \"out of his senses\"; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the most moving love stories in American history. <p> This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship, and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, <i>John Adams</i> is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.</p>",

    "description": "Kathleen Brown examines the origins of racism and slavery in British North America from the perspective of gender. Both a basic social relationship and a model for other social hierarchies, gender helped determine the construction of racial categories and the institution of slavery in Virginia. But the rise of racial slavery also transformed gender relations, including ideals of masculinity. In response to the presence of Indians, the shortage of labor, and the insecurity of social rank, Virginia's colonial government tried to reinforce its authority by regulating the labor and sexuality of English servants and by making legal distinctions between English and African women. This practice, along with making slavery hereditary through the mother, contributed to the cultural shift whereby women of African descent assumed from lower-class English women both the burden of fieldwork and the stigma of moral corruption. Brown's analysis extends through Bacon's Rebellion in 1676, an important juncture in consolidating the colony's white male public culture, and into the eighteenth century. She demonstrates that, despite elite planters' dominance, wives, children, free people of color, and enslaved men and women continued to influence the meaning of race and class in colonial Virginia.",

    "description": "<i>This Side of Paradise,</i> F. Scott Fitzgerald's romantic and witty first novel, was written when the author was only twenty-three years old.

It remains the most courageous, insightful, and eloquent critique of the pre-1960s South.<br /><br /><br />\"I began to see racism and its rituals of segregation as a symptom of a grave illness,\" Smith wrote. \"When people think more of their skin color than of their souls, something has happened to them.\" Today, readers are rediscovering in Smith's writings a forceful analysis of the dynamics of racism, as well as her prophetic understanding of the connections between racial and sexual oppression.",

    "description": "Man's Search for Meaning has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Between 1942 and 1945 psychiatrist Viktor Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the stories of his many patients, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankl's theory\u2014known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos (\"meaning\")\u2014holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful. In the decades since its first publication in 1959, Man's Search for Meaning has become a classic, with more than twelve million copies in print around the world. A 1991 Library of Congress survey that asked readers to name a \"book that made a difference in your life\" found Man's Search for Meaning among the ten most influential books in America. At once a memoir, a meditation, a treatise, and a history, it continues to inspire us all to find significance in the very act of living.<br />(back cover)",

They were the worst-behaved class in the whole school.<br /><br />So begins this quirky classic, first published in 1977 and still relevant today as a lighthearted reminder to show our appreciation to those we value. The students don\u2019t proffer a shred of respect for their good-natured teacher Miss Nelson, but when the witchy substitute Miss Viola Swamp appears on the scene, they start to regret their own wicked ways. James Marshall\u2019s scritchy, cartoonish full-color ink and wash illustrations are hilarious. A back-to-school perennial!",

    "description": "It is a literary event when a genuinely new fictional voice comes along. When that voice achieves its newness not through a certain formal facility but through the freshness of its vision, there is truly something to celebrate. Matt Ruff was only twenty-two when Fool on the Hill was first published, but with his novel he gave us a story that won over readers of every persuasion. Not your usual first effort, Fool on the Hill is a full-blown epic of life and death, good and evil, magic and love.<br /><br />Think of the imaginative daring of Mark Helprin\u2019s Winter\u2019s Tale. The zany popism of Tom Robbins\u2019s Another Roadside Attraction. The gnomish fantasies of J.R. Tolkien. Think of these and you begin to get some idea of one of the most remarkable first novels to come along in years.<br /><br />In the world of Fool on the Hill dogs and cats can talk, a subculture of sprites lives in the shadows and underfoot (if you\u2019re the sensitive type, or drunk enough, you might see them cavorting across the lawn), and the Bohemians, a group of Harley- and horseback-riding students dedicated to all things unconventional, hold all-night revels for the glory of their cause.<br /><br />Then there is Stephen Titus George, the novel\u2019s youthful hero, who somehow finds himself the main player in a story that began well over a century ago. George is a mild-mannered flier of kites, a sometimes writer of bestselling fiction, and would-be knight looking for a maiden. George will find his girl and the century-old story will provide the proverbial dragon whose slaying will sanctify their love. But it will not be a sword that fells the foe but the transforming power of the imagination.",

    "description": "This definitive collection showcases thirty years of work by one of the most significant American poets of the twentieth century, bringing together verse that originally appeared in eight acclaimed books of poetry ranging from \"Hello: A Journal \"(1978) to \"Life &amp; Death\" (1998) and \"If I were writing this\" (2003). Robert Creeley, who was involved with the publication of this volume before his death in 2005, helped define an emerging counter-tradition to the prevailing literary establishment--the new postwar poetry originating with Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, and Louis Zukofsky and expanding through the lives and works of Charles Olson, Robert Duncan, Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov, and others. \"The Collected Poems of Robert Creeley, 1975-2005\" will stand together with \"The Collected Poems of Robert Creeley, 1975-2000\" as essential reading for anyone interested in twentieth-century American poetry.",

Few poets so thrillingly portray the physical world, or man's creaturely self, or the cycling strain of desire and self-reproach. Few poets so movingly evoke the human quest of \"a man alone,\" trying --to say something true that has body, because it is proof of his existence.. . <i> Middle Earth</i> is a revelatory collection, the finest work yet from an author of poems that are . . .marvels-unbuttoned, riveting, dramatic-burned into being-- (Tina Barr, <i>Boston Review</i>).",

With poems in the leading journals of the day -- American Poetry Review, Grand Street, Conjunctions, The Boston Review, to name just a few -- Gander plumbs the erotic depths of human interaction with the land. The poems in Science Steepleflower test this relationship with what Publisher's Weekly has called \"an inbred (and often haunting) spirituality\", bringing us to new vistas of linguistic and perceptive grace.",

    "description": "Read Daniel Pinchbeck's posts on the Penguin Blog<br />Cross James Merrill, H. P. Lovecraft, and Carlos Castaneda -each imbued with a twenty-first-century aptitude for quantum theory and existential psychology-and you get the voice of Daniel Pinchbeck. And yet, nothing quite prepares us for the lucidity, rationale, and informed audacity of this seeker, skeptic, and cartographer of hidden realms. <br />Throughout the 1990s, Pinchbeck had been a member of New York's literary select. He wrote for publications such as \"The New York Times Magazine,\" \"Esquire,\" and \"Harper's Bazaar.\" His first book, \"Breaking Open the Head,\" was heralded as the most significant on psychedelic experimentation since the work of Terence McKenna. <br />But slowly something happened: Rather than writing from a journalistic remove, Pinchbeck-his literary powers at their peak-began to participate in the shamanic and metaphysical belief systems he was encountering. As his psyche and body opened to new experience, disparate threads and occurrences made sense like never before: Humanity, every sign pointed, is precariously balanced between greater self-potential and environmental disaster. The Mayan calendar's \"end date\" of 2012 seems to define our present age: It heralds the end of one way of existence and the return of another, in which the serpent god Quetzalcoatl reigns anew, bringing with him an unimaginably ancient-yet, to us, wholly new-way of living. <br />A result not just of study but also of participation, \"2012\" tells the tale of a single man in whose trials we ultimately recognize our own hopes and anxieties about modern life.",

Returning to his native Paris, Florent finds a city he barely recognizes, with its working classes displaced to make way for broad boulevards and bourgeois flats. Living with his brother's family in the newly rebuilt Les Halles market, Florent is soon caught up in a dangerous maelstrom of food and politics. Amid intrigue among the market's sellers\u2014the fishmonger, the charcutiere, the fruit girl, and the cheese vendor\u2014and the glorious culinary bounty of their labors, we see the dramatic difference between \"fat and thin\" (the rich and the poor) and how the widening gulf between them strains a city to the breaking point.",

This new translation of the eleventh novel in Zola's Rougon-Macquart cycle captures the spirit of one of his greatest works.",

Out of Africa, the world's most ancient and stable landmass, Homo sapiens dispersed across the globe.\u00a0\u00a0And yet the continent that gave birth to human history has long been woefully misunderstood and mistreated by the rest of the world.<br /><br />In a book as splendid in its wealth of information as it is breathtaking in scope, British writer and photojournalist John Reader brings to light Africa's geology and evolution, the majestic array of its landforms and environments, the rich diversity of its peoples and their ways of life, the devastating legacies of slavery and colonialism as well as recent political troubles and triumphs. Written in simple, elegant prose and illustrated with Reader's own photographs, <b>Africa: A Biography of the Continent</b> is an unforgettable book that will delight the general reader and expert alike.\u00a0\u00a0<br /><br />\"Breathtaking in its scope and detail.\" --<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>",

    "description": "Neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran is internationally renowned for uncovering answers to the deep and quirky questions of human nature that few scientists have dared to address. His bold insights about the brain are matched only by the stunning simplicity of his experiments -- using such low-tech tools as cotton swabs, glasses of water and dime-store mirrors. In <em>Phantoms in the Brain,</em> Dr. Ramachandran recounts how his work with patients who have bizarre neurological disorders has shed new light on the deep architecture of the brain, and what these findings tell us about who we are, how we construct our body image, why we laugh or become depressed, why we may believe in God, how we make decisions, deceive ourselves and dream, perhaps even why we're so clever at philosophy, music and art. Some of his most notable cases:<br /><br /><br />A woman paralyzed on the left side of her body who believes she is lifting a tray of drinks with both hands offers a unique opportunity to test Freud's theory of denial.<br />A man who insists he is talking with God challenges us to ask: Could we be \"wired\" for religious experience?<br />A woman who hallucinates cartoon characters illustrates how, in a sense, we are all hallucinating, all the time.<br />Dr. Ramachandran's inspired medical detective work pushes the boundaries of medicine's last great frontier -- the human mind -- yielding new and provocative insights into the \"big questions\" about consciousness and the self.",

    "description": "When we first met him in Rabbit, Run (1960), the book that established John Updike as a major novelist, Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom is playing basketball with some boys in an alley in Pennsylvania during the tail end of the Eisenhower era, reliving for a moment his past as a star high school athlete. Athleticism of a different sort is on display throughout these four magnificent novels\u2014the athleticism of an imagination possessed of the ability to lay bare, with a seemingly effortless animal grace, the enchantments and disenchantments of life.<br /><br /><br /><br />Updike revisited his hero toward the end of each of the following decades in the second half of this American century; and in each of the subsequent novels, as Rabbit, his wife, Janice, his son, Nelson, and the people around them grow, these characters take on the lineaments of our common existence. In prose that is one of the glories of contemporary literature, Updike has chronicled the frustrations and ambiguous triumphs, the longuers, the loves and frenzies, the betrayals and reconciliations of our era. He has given us our representative American story.<br /><br /><br /><br />This Rabbit Angstrom volume is composed of the following novels: Rabbit, Run; Rabbit Redux; Rabbit is Rich; and Rabbit at Rest.",

    "description": "First published in 1968, <em>Weimar Culture</em> is one of the masterworks of Peter Gay's distinguished career. A study of German culture between the two wars, the book brilliantly traces the rise of the artistic, literary, and musical culture that bloomed ever so briefly in the 1920s amid the chaos of Germany's tenuous post-World War I democracy, and crashed violently in the wake of Hitler's rise to power. Despite the ephemeral nature of the Weimar democracy, the influence of its culture was profound and far-reaching, ushering in a modern sensibility in the arts that dominated Western culture for most of the twentieth century. Vivid and eminently readable, <em>Weimar Culture</em> is the finest introduction for the casual reader and historian alike.",

Published between 1967 and 2000, they chronicle the history of Vidal's \"American Empire\", from dawn to decay, by interweaving the private stories of two fictional American families with the public stories of historical personages. Although the seven novels were not published in order of historical chronology, they can be read in either historical or publication order without sacrificing narrative intelligibility. Vidal insisted on the title \"Narratives of Empire\" for the series, despite his publishers\u2019 preference for the safer, mainstream \"American Chronicles\".",

    "description": "Dorothy Parker, more than any of her contemporaries, captured the spirit of the Jazz Age in her poetry and prose, and <i>The Collected Dorothy Parker</i> includes an introduction by Brendan Gill in Penguin Modern Classics.<br /><br />Dorothy Parker was the most talked-about woman of her day, notorious as the hard-drinking bad girl with a talent for stinging repartee and endlessly quotable one-liners. The decadent 1920s and 1930s in New York were a time of great experiment and daring for women. For the rich, life seemed a continual party, but the excesses took their emotional toll. In the bitingly witty poems and stories collected here, along with her articles and reviews, she brilliantly captures the spirit of the decadent Jazz Age in New York, exposing both the dazzle and the darkness. But beneath the sharp perceptions and acidic humour, much of her work poignantly expresses the deep vulnerability of a troubled, self-destructive woman who, in the words of philosopher Irwin Edman, was 'a Sappho who could combine a heartbreak with a wisecrack'.<br /><br />Dorothy Parker (1893-1967) was born in West End, New Jersey, and grew up in New York. In 1916 she sold some of her poetry to the editor of <i>Vogue</i>, and was subsequently given an editorial position on the magazine. She then became drama critic of <i>Vanity Fair </i>and the central figure of the celebrated Algonquin Round Table, whose members included George S. Kaufman and Harpo Marx. Her collections of poems included <i>Enough Rope</i> (1926) and <i>Not So Deep as a Well</i> (1936), and her collections of stories included <i>Here Lies</i> (1939); in addition, she collaborated on and wrote screenplays including the Oscar-winning <i>A Star is Born</i> (1937), and Alfred Hitchcock's <i>Saboteur</i> (1942).<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>The Collected Dorothy Parker</i>, you might like Truman Capote's <i>The Complete Stories</i>, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.<br /><br />'She managed to express her real feelings in stanzas which snap and glitter like a Chanel handbag'<br />Peter Ackroyd, <i>The Times</i>",

Together and apart, Max and Eleanor participate in the great political and intellectual movements which shape the twentieth century, taking them from Cambridge and Berlin to the Spanish Civil War, Russia, the Sahara, and finally to Los Alamos to witness the first nuclear test.<br />-- Hopeful Monsters received Britain's prestigious Whitbread Award in 1990.<br />-- Praising Mosley's ability to distill complex modes of thought, the New York Times called Hopeful Monsters a virtual encyclopedia of twentieth century thought, in fictional form.<br />-- First U.S. edition by Dalkey Archive ('90), most recent paperback by Vintage ('93).",

    "description": "\"ART BUCHWALD DOES IT AGAIN. . . . A GREAT READ.\"<br />--Larry King, USA Today<br /><br />In 1948, an American innocent named Art Buchwald set sail for Paris, France, determined to crash Hemingway's moveable feast and make himself famous. What's more, he did it.<br /><br />Now he remembers those golden years--when he wrote for the Paris Herald Tribune, fell in love, spoofed Hemingway, dined with gangsters, and crashed costume balls in Venice. Everything that has made Buchwald one of the world's best-loved writers is in this funny, enchanting, poignant book. <br /><br />\"HONEST AND MOVING . . . A CONSUMMATE STORYTELLER.\"<br />--The New York Times Book Review<br /><br />\"ROLLICKING . . . The book gallops and gambols along. . . . Buchwald is a master of the anecdote.\"<br />--The Baltimore Sun",

    "description": "A provocative, eye-opening look at the way media shapes every aspect of our lives.<br /><br />Just when you thought there was nothing new to say about the media, along comes a book that transcends the conventional wisdom with an original vision, one that unites our most intimate personal concerns with far-reaching historical trends in an accessible way. From Princess Diana's funeral to the prospect of mass terror, from oral sex in the Oval Office to cowboy politics in distant lands, from high school cliques to marital therapy, from hip-hop nation to climbing Mt. Everest, from blogs to reality TV to the Weather Channel, Mediated takes us on a tour of every department of our media-saturated society. And at every turn we see ourselves as we are, immersed in options, surrounded by representations, driven to unprecedented levels of self-consciousness-and obliged by these circumstances to transform our very lives into performances.<br /><br />Sophisticated, satirical, sometimes searing, ultimately forgiving, Mediated tackles everything we take for granted and reintroduces us to it all as if for the first time. You'll laugh, you'll squirm, you'll agree, you'll object-but you'll find more Aha! moments packed into fewer pages than you've ever come across before.",

    "description": "Handel is a failed priest but abiding Catholic with elitist tendencies whose work as a doctor forces him to consider social questions that he would probably rather avoid. Picasso, as she calls herself, is a young artist who has been sexually abused by her brother but whose family thinks she is at fault for her dark moods. Sappho is, indeed, Sappho, the lesbian poet of ancient Greece, who here proclaims herself a sensualist and then proceeds to dissect \"the union of language and lust.\" The three converge in a place that may be England in a not-too-distant future made ugly by pollution and even uglier by greed. This is not a novel but an extended rift on art, sex, religion, social repression, the dangers of patriarchy, and everything that is wrong with the contemporary drift to the right. As such, it will be hard going for most readers, but those with some patience will discover exceptionally evocative writing and a vivifying review of some much-discussed contemporary issues.",

The child, Jordan, is rescued by Dog Woman and grows up to travel the world like Gulliver, though he finds that the world\u2019s most curious oddities come from his own mind. Winterson leads the reader from discussions on the nature of time to Jordan\u2019s fascination with journeys concealed within other journeys, all with a dizzying speed that shoots the reader from epiphany to shimmering epiphany.",

    "description": "<i>Prodigal Summer</i> weaves together three stories of human love within a larger tapestry of lives inhabiting the forested mountains and struggling small farms of southern Appalachia.<br /><br />From her outpost in an isolated mountain cabin, Deanna Wolfe, a reclusive wildlife biologist, watches a den of coyotes that have recently migrated into the region. She is caught off-guard by a young hunter who invades her most private spaces and confounds her self-assured, solitary life. On a farm several miles down the mountain, Lusa Maluf Landowski, a bookish city girl turned farmer's wife, finds herself unexpectedly marooned in a strange place where she must declare or lose her attachment to the land that has become her own. And a few more miles down the road, a pair of elderly feuding neighbors tend their respective farms and wrangle about God, pesticides, and the possibilities of a future neither of them expected.<br /><br />Over the course of one humid summer, these characters find their connections to one another and to the flora and fauna with whom they share a place. <i>Prodigal Summer</i> demonstrates a balance of narrative, drama and ideas that is characteristic of Barbara Kingsolver's finest work.",

    "description": "The final book in the Regeneration Trilogy, and winner of the 1995 Booker Prize <br />\"The Ghost Road\" is the culminating masterpiece of Pat Barker's towering World War I fiction trilogy. The time of the novel is the closing months of the most senselessly savage of modern conflicts. In France, millions of men engaged in brutal trench warfare are all \"ghosts in the making.\" In England, psychologist William Rivers, with severe pangs of conscience, treats the mental casualties of the war to make them whole enough to fight again. One of these, Billy Prior, risen to the officer class from the working class, both courageous and sardonic, decides to return to France with his fellow officer, poet Wilfred Owen, to fight a war he no longer believes in. Meanwhile, Rivers, enfevered by influenza, returns in memory to his experience studying a South Pacific tribe whose ethos amounted to a culture of death. Across the gulf between his society and theirs, Rivers begins to form connections that cast new light on his--and our--understanding of war. <br /> Combining poetic intensity with gritty realism, blending biting humor with tragic drama, moving toward a denouement as inevitable as it is devastating, \"The Ghost Road\" both encapsulates history and transcends it. It is a modern masterpiece<br />",

Until he meets Curt MacCrae, an emaciated, semi-homeless, high school dropout guitar genius, the stuff of which Lower East Side punk rock legends are made. Never mind that Troy's dad thinks Curt's a drug addict and Troy's brother thinks Troy's the biggest (literally) loser in Manhattan. Soon, Curt has recruited Troy as his new drummer, even though Troy can't play the drums. Together, Curt and Troy will change the world of punk, and Troy's own life, forever.",

For a year and a day later, four Mysterious Strangers appeared, and, as Amatus grew to manhood, they guided him on a perilous quest to discover his true identity--not to mention adventure, danger, tragedy, triumph, and true love.<br /><br />John Barnes has been heralded as \"one of the most able and impressive of SF's rising stars\" (<i>Publishers Weekly)</i> for his widely praised novels including <i>Orbital Resonance</i> and <i>A Million Open Doors.</i><br /><br />Now, in <i>One for the Morning Glory,</i> John Barnes has crafted an artful and immensely entertaining fable that takes its place as a modern fantasy classic beside such enduring works as William Goldman's <i>The Princess Bride</i> and T.H. White's <i>The Once and Future King.</i><br />",

Now, for the first time, Peter R. Mitchell and John Schoeffel have assembled the best of Chomsky's talks on the politics of power. With an eye to political activism and the media\u2019s role in popular struggle, as well as US foreign and domestic policy, Chomsky reinterprets the events of the past three decades, from foreign policy during the Vietnam War to the decline of welfare under the Clinton administration. Highlighting America\u2019s myriad of social inequalities and political issues while offering timely advice for much needed change, <i>Understanding Power</i> is definitive Chomsky.<br /><b></b><br /><b> \u2018Chomsky ranks with Marx, Shakespeare and the Bible as one of the ten most quoted sources in the humanities\u2019 <i>Guardian</i></b><br /><b></b><br /><b>\u2018Powerful and timely...his analysis is fair, meticulously researched and fascinating\u2019</b> <b>\n  <i>Observer</i>\n</b>",

    "description": "Born at the beginning of the twentieth century, Henry Smart lives through the evolution of modern Ireland, and in this extraordinary novel he brilliantly tells his story. From his own birth and childhood on the streets of Dublin to his role as soldier (and lover) in the Irish Rebellion, Henry recounts his early years of reckless heroism and adventure. At once an epic, a love story, and a portrait of Irish history, A Star Called Henry is a grand picaresque novel brimming with both poignant moments and comic ones, and told in a voice that is both quintessentially Irish and inimitably Roddy Doyle's.",

    "description": "<b><i>New York Times </i>Bestseller</b><br /><br /><b>The good, the bad, and the ugly, served up Bourdain-style.</b><br /><br />Bestselling chef and <i>No Reservations </i>host Anthony Bourdain has never been one to pull punches. In <i>The Nasty Bits</i>, he serves up a well-seasoned hellbroth of candid, often outrageous stories from his worldwide misadventures. Whether scrounging for eel in the backstreets of Hanoi, revealing what you didn't want to know about the more unglamorous aspects of making television, calling for the head of raw food activist Woody Harrelson, or confessing to lobster-killing guilt, Bourdain is as entertaining as ever. Bringing together the best of his previously uncollected nonfiction--and including new, never-before-published material--<i>The Nasty Bits</i> is a rude, funny, brutal and passionate stew for fans and the uninitiated alike. Anthony Bourdain is the author of seven books including the bestselling <i>Kitchen Confidential</i> and <i>A Cook's Tour</i>. A thirty-year veteran of professional kitchens, he is the host of <i>No Reservations </i>on the Discovery Channel, and the executive chef at Les Halles in Manhattan. He lives in New York City.<br /><br />Praise for Anthony Bourdain: \"Bourdain's enthusiasm is so intense that it practically explodes off the page . . . Bourdain shows himself to be one of the country's best food writers. His opinions are as strong as his language, and his tastes as infectious as his joy.\"--<i>New York Times Book Review</i><br /><br />\"[Writes] the kind of book you read in one sitting, then rush about annoying your coworkers by declaiming whole passages.\"--<i>USA Today</i><br /><br />\"Bourdain's prose is utterly riveting, swaggering with stylish machismo and a precise ear for kitchen patois.\"--<i>New York </i>magazine",

And tell your girls, my son, that when they're running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you - tell them that - brazen baggages you meet at dancing classes\"</b><br /><br />The marriage of Gertrude and Walter Morel has become a battleground. Repelled by her uneducated and sometimes violent husband, delicate Gertrude devotes her life to her children, especially to her sons, William and Paul - determined they will not follow their father into working down the coal mines. But conflict is evitable when Paul seeks to escape his mother's suffocating grasp through relationships with women his own age. Set in Lawrence's native Nottinghamshire, <i>Sons and Lovers</i> is a highly autobiographical and compelling portrayal of childhood, adolescence and the clash of generations.",

    "description": "Gregory Bateson was a philosopher, anthropologist, photographer, naturalist, and poet, as well as the husband and collaborator of Margaret Mead. With a new foreword by his daughter Mary Katherine Bateson, this classic anthology of his major work will continue to delight and inform generations of readers.<br /><br /> \"This collection amounts to a retrospective exhibition of a working life. . . . Bateson has come to this position during a career that carried him not only into anthropology, for which he was first trained, but into psychiatry, genetics, and communication theory. . . . He . . . examines the nature of the mind, seeing it not as a nebulous something, somehow lodged somewhere in the body of each man, but as a network of interactions relating the individual with his society and his species and with the universe at large.\"\u2014D. W. Harding, <i>New York Review of Books</i><br /><br /> \"[Bateson's] view of the world, of science, of culture, and of man is vast and challenging. His efforts at synthesis are tantalizingly and cryptically suggestive. . . .This is a book we should all read and ponder.\"\u2014Roger Keesing, <i>American Anthropologist</i><br /><br />",

Dennett, whom Chet Raymo of <i>The Boston Globe</i> calls \"one of the most provocative thinkers on the planet,\" focuses his unerringly logical mind on the theory of natural selection, showing how Darwin's great idea transforms and illuminates our traditional view of humanity's place in the universe. Dennett vividly describes the theory itself and then extends Darwin's vision with impeccable arguments to their often surprising conclusions, challenging the views of some of the most famous scientists of our day.",

    "description": "<b>A Leadership Network Publication</b> <i>A New Kind of Christian</i>'s conversation between a pastor and his daughter's high school science teacher reveals that wisdom for life's most pressing spiritual questions can come from the most unlikely sources. This stirring fable captures a new spirit of Christianity--where personal, daily interaction with God is more important than institutional church structures, where faith is more about a way of life than a system of belief, where being authentically good is more important than being doctrinally \"right,\" and where one's direction is more important than one's present location. Brian McLaren's delightful account offers a wise and wondrous approach for revitalizing Christian spiritual life and Christian congregations.<br /><br />If you are interested in joining a discussion group devoted to a <i>A New Kind of Christian</i> please visit <b><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NKOC\" rel=\"nofollow\">groups.yahoo.com/group/NKOC</a></b>.",

    "description": "The true story of an individual's struggle for self-identity, self-preservation, and freedom, <i>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</i> remains among the few extant slave narratives written by a woman. This autobiographical account chronicles the remarkable odyssey of Harriet Jacobs (1813\u20131897) whose dauntless spirit and faith carried her from a life of servitude and degradation in North Carolina to liberty and reunion with her children in the North.<br />Written and published in 1861 after Jacobs' harrowing escape from a vile and predatory master, the memoir delivers a powerful and unflinching portrayal of the abuses and hypocrisy of the master-slave relationship. Jacobs writes frankly of the horrors she suffered as a slave, her eventual escape after several unsuccessful attempts, and her seven years in self-imposed exile, hiding in a coffin-like \"garret\" attached to her grandmother's porch.<br />A rare firsthand account of a courageous woman's determination and endurance, this inspirational story also represents a valuable historical record of the continuing battle for freedom and the preservation of family.",

    "description": "The bestselling author of The Professor and the Madman and The Map That Changed the World examines the enduring and world-changing effects of the catastrophic eruption off the coast of Java of the earth's most dangerous volcano \u2014 Krakatoa. <br /><br />The legendary annihilation in 1883 of the volcano-island of Krakatoa \u2014 the name has since become a byword for a cataclysmic disaster \u2014 was followed by an immense tsunami that killed nearly forty thousand people. Beyond the purely physical horrors of an event that has only very recently been properly understood, the eruption changed the world in more ways than could possibly be imagined. Dust swirled round the planet for years, causing temperatures to plummet and sunsets to turn vivid with lurid and unsettling displays of light. The effects of the immense waves were felt as far away as France. Barometers in Bogot\u00e1 and Washington, D.C., went haywire. Bodies were washed up in Zanzibar. The sound of the island's destruction was heard in Australia and India and on islands thousands of miles away. Most significant of all \u2014 in view of today's new political climate \u2014 the eruption helped to trigger in Java a wave of murderous anti-Western militancy among fundamentalist Muslims: one of the first outbreaks of Islamic-inspired killings anywhere. <br /><br />Simon Winchester's long experience in the world wandering as well as his knowledge of history and geology give us an entirely new perspective on this fascinating and iconic event as he brings it telling back to life.",

    "description": "By the time the First World War ended in 1918, eight million people had died in what had been perhaps the most apocalyptic episode the world had known.<br /><br />This Very Short Introduction provides a concise and insightful history of the Great War--from the state of Europe in 1914, to the role of the US, the collapse of Russia, and the eventual surrender of the Central Powers. Examining how and why the war was fought, as well as the historical controversies that still surround the war, Michael Howard also looks at how peace was ultimately made, and describes the potent legacy of resentment left to Germany.<br /><br /><strong>About the Series: </strong> Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.<br />",

Waking up after a fantastic night unlike anything he's ever experienced, he discovers that his girlfriend, Jody, is a vampire. And surprise! Now he's one, too. For some couples, the whole biting-and-blood thing would have been a deal breaker. But Tommy and Jody are in love, and they vow to work through their issues. <br /><br />But word has it that the vampire who initially nibbled on Jody wasn't supposed to be recruiting. Even worse, Tommy's erstwhile turkey-bowling pals are out to get him, at the urging of a blue-dyed Las Vegas call girl named (duh) Blue. <br /><br />And that really sucks.",

    "description": "A longtime investigative journalist uncovers one of the great untold stories of twentieth-century international intrigue, and the secrets it has held until now.<br /><br />Shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis and Bobby Kennedy, two of the world\u2032s richest and most powerful men, disliked one another from the moment they first met. Over several decades, their intense mutual hatred only grew, as did their desire to compete for the affections of Jackie, the keeper of the Camelot flame.<br /><br />Now, this shocking work by seasoned investigative journalist Peter Evans reveals the culmination of the Kennedy-Onassis-Kennedy love triangle: Onassis was at the heart of the plot to kill Bobby Kennedy. Nemesis meticulously traces Onassis\u2032s trail - his connections, the way that he financed the assassination - and includes a confession kept secret for three decades. With its deeply nuanced portraits of the major figures and events that shaped an era, Nemesis is a work that will not soon be forgotten.",

    "description": "On a remote farm in South Africa, the protagonist of J. M. Coetzee's fierce and passionate novel watches the life from which she has been excluded. Ignored by her callous father, scorned and feared by his servants, she is a bitterly intelligent woman whose outward meekness disguises a desperate resolve not to become \"one of the forgotten ones of history.\" When her father takes an African mistress, that resolve precipitates an act of vengeance that suggests a chemical reaction between the colonizer and the colonized -- and between European yearnings and the vastness and solitude of Africa.<p><br /><br />A story told in prose as feverishly rich as William Faulkner's, <i>In the Heart of the Country</i> is a work of irresistable power. With vast assurance and an unerring eye, J. M. Coetzee has turned the family romance into a mirror of the colonial experience.</p>",

Starting in the present day and moving backward, the novel is told in the voices of the three women: fifteen-year-old part-black Rayona; her American Indian mother, Christine, consumed by tenderness and resentment toward those she loves; and the fierce and mysterious Ida, mother and grandmother whose haunting secrets, betrayals, and dreams echo through the years, braiding together the strands of the shared past.",

    "description": "The day the brochure came was a typical one. With a wife and five small children, a hectic schedule, and a new book due to his publishers, Nicholas Sparks was busy with his usual routine. The colorful mailer, however, described something very different: a tour to some of the most exotic places on Earth. Slowly, an idea took hold in Nicholas's mind and heart. In January 2003, Nicholas Sparks and his brother, Micah, set off on a three-week trip around the globe. It was to mark a milestone in their lives, for at thirty-seven and thirty-eight respectively, they were now the only surviving members of their family. And as they voyaged to the lost city of Machu Picchu high in the Andes. . . to mysterious Easter Island. . . to Ayers Rock in the Australian outback. . . and across the vast Indian subcontinent, the ultimate story of their lives would unfold. Against the backdrop of the wonders of the world and often overtaken by their feelings, daredevil Micah and the more serious, introspective Nicholas recalled their rambunctious childhood adventures and the tragedies that tested their faith. And in the process, they discovered startling truths about loss, love and hope. Narrated with irrepressible humor and rare candor, and including personal photographs, Three Weeks with my Brother reminds us to embrace life with all its uncertainties. . . and most of all, to cherish the joyful times, both small and momentous, and the wonderful people who make them possible.<br /><br /><i>Did You Know?---<br /><br />Three Weeks With My Brother is Nicholas's second work of non-fiction? (The first was Wokini, written with Olympic Gold Medalist Billy Mills.)<br /><br />Nicholas and Micah Sparks wrote the book together from separate coasts by talking on the phone and faxing drafts back and forth?<br /><br />The trip around the world was part of a Notre Dame alumni package?</i>",

But Zuni's appeal goes beyond recipes. Harold McGee concludes, \"What makes <em>The Zuni Caf\u00e9 Cookbook</em> a real treasure is the voice of Zuni's Judy Rodgers,\" whose book \"repeatedly sheds a fresh and revealing light on ingredients and dishes, and even on the nature of cooking itself.\" Deborah Madison (<em>Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone</em>) says the introduction alone \"should be required reading for every person who might cook something someday.\"",

    "description": "Fourteen-year-old Trixie Stone is in love for the first time. She's also the light of her father, Daniel's life -- a straight-A student; a pretty, popular freshman in high school; a girl who's always seen her father as a hero. That is, until her world is turned upside down with a single act of violence. Suddenly everything Trixie has believed about her family -- and herself -- seems to be a lie. Could the boyfriend who once made Trixie wild with happiness have been the one to end her childhood forever? She says that he is, and that is all it takes to make Daniel, a seemingly mild-mannered comic book artist with a secret tumultuous past he has hidden even from his family, venture to hell and back to protect his daughter. <p> With <i>The Tenth Circle</i>, Jodi Picoult offers her most powerful chronicle yet as she explores the unbreakable bond between parent and child, and questions whether you can reinvent yourself in the course of a lifetime -- or if your mistakes are carried forever.</p>",

    "description": "This first full-scale history of the development of the American suburb examines how -the good life- in America came to be equated with the a home of one's own surrounded by a grassy yard and located far from the urban workplace. Integrating social history with economic and architectural analysis, and taking into account such factors as the availability of cheap land, inexpensive building methods, and rapid transportation, Kenneth Jackson chronicles the phenomenal growth of the American suburb from the middle of the 19th century to the present day. He treats communities in every section of the U.S. and compares American residential patterns with those of Japan and Europe. In conclusion, Jackson offers a controversial prediction: that the future of residential deconcentration will be very different from its past in both the U.S. and Europe. <br />",

Henry provided an embarrassment of riches for the compilers of this volume.The final selection of the thirty-eight stories in this collection offers for the reader's delight those tales honored almost unanimously by anthologists and those that represent, in variety and balance, the best work of America's favorite storyteller.They are tales in his most mellow, humorous, and ironic moods.They give the full range and flavor of the man born William Sydney Porter but known throughout the world as O. Henry, one of the great masters of the short story.\"",

In this groundbreaking collection of essays and recipes, Bertolli evocatively explores the philosophy behind the food that Molly O\u2019Neill of the <i>New York Times</i> described as \u201cdeceptively simple, [with] favors clean, deep, and layered more profusely than a mille-feuille.\u201d<br /><br />From \u201cTwelve Ways of Looking at Tomatoes\u201d to Italian salumi in \u201cThe Whole Hog,\u201d Bertolli explores his favorite foods with the vividness of a natural writer and the instincts of a superlative chef. Scattered throughout are more than 140 recipes remarkable for their clarity, simplicity, and seductive appeal, from Salad of Bitter Greens, Walnuts, Tesa, and Parmigiano and Chilled Shellfish with Salsa Verde to Short Ribs Agrodolce and Tagliolini Pasta with Crab. Unforgettable desserts, such as Semifreddo of Peaches and Mascarpone and Hazelnut Meringata with Chocolate and Espresso Sauce, round out a collection that\u2019s destined to become required reading for any food lover.<br /><br />Rich with the remarkable food memories that inspire him, from the taste of ripe Santa Rosa plums and the aroma of dried porcini mushrooms in his mother\u2019s ragu to eating grilled bistecca alla Fiorentina on a foggy late autumn day in Chianti, <b>Cooking by Hand </b>will ignite a passion within you to become more creatively involved in the food you cook.",

It is said that angels found the land and saw it was good... and the ensuing race that rose from the seed of angels and men live by one simple rule: Love as thou wilt. <br /><br />Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay is a young woman who was born with a scarlet mote in her left eye. Sold into indentured servitude as a child, her bond is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, a nobleman with very a special mission... and the first one to recognize who and what she is: one pricked by Kushiel's Dart, chosen to forever experience pain and pleasure as one.<br /><br />Ph\u00e8dre is trained equally in the courtly arts and the talents of the bedchamber, but, above all, the ability to observe, remember, and analyze. Almost as talented a spy as she is courtesan, Ph\u00e8dre stumbles upon a plot that threatens the very foundations of her homeland. Treachery sets her on her path; love and honor goad her further. And in the doing, it will take her to the edge of despair... and beyond. Hateful friend, loving enemy, beloved assassin; they can all wear the same glittering mask in this world, and Ph\u00e8dre will get but one chance to save all that she holds dear. <br /><br />Set in a world of cunning poets, deadly courtiers, heroic traitors, and a truly Machiavellian villainess, this is a novel of grandeur, luxuriance, sacrifice, betrayal, and deeply laid conspiracies. Not since Dune has there been an epic on the scale of Kushiel's Dart-a massive tale about the violent death of an old age, and the birth of a new.",

He meets professional paranormal investigators and takes part in s\u00e9ances and a vigil in the most haunted house in Britain, tries out divining rods and ouija boards, and goes on set with TV's <i>Most Haunted</i>. But Will also seeks out the sceptics in clinical psychology and philosophy who ask if spirits are really just in our heads.<br /><br />His journey is full of bizarre, terrifying and hilarious experiences, each one a new insight into life, death and what might come after.",

The ghost, it turns out, is the stepfather of a young groupie who committed suicide after the 54-year-old Coyne callously used her up and threw her away. Now, determined to kill Coyne and anyone who aids him, the merciless ghost of Craddock McDermott begins his assault on the rocker's sanity.",

    "description": "<i>\u201cThey were born in the city from people born elsewhere.\u201d</i><br /><i>\n  <br /></i><b>What We All Long For</b> follows the overlapping stories of a close circle of second-generation twenty-somethings living in downtown Toronto. There\u2019s Tuyen, a lesbian avant-garde artist and the daughter of Vietnamese parents who\u2019ve never recovered from losing one of their children in the crush to board a boat out of Vietnam in the 1970s. Tuyen defines herself in opposition to just about everything her family believes in and strives for. She\u2019s in love with her best friend Carla, a biracial bicycle courier, who\u2019s still reeling from the loss of her mother to suicide eighteen years earlier and who must now deal with her brother Jamal\u2019s latest acts of delinquency. Oku is a jazz-loving poet who, unbeknownst to his Jamaican-born parents, has dropped out of university. He is in constant conflict with his narrow-minded and verbally abusive father and tormented by his unrequited love for Jackie, a gorgeous black woman who runs a hip clothing shop on Queen Street West and dates only white men. Like each of her friends, Jackie feels alienated from her parents, former hipsters from Nova Scotia who never made it out of subsidized housing after their lives became entangled with desire and disappointment. <br /><br />The four characters try to make a life for themselves in the city, supporting one another through their family struggles.<br /><br />There\u2019s a fifth main character, Quy, the child who Tuyen\u2019s parents lost in Vietnam. In his first-person narrative, Quy describes how he survived in various refugee camps, then in the Thai underworld. After years of being hardened, he has finally made his way to Toronto and will soon be reunited with his family \u2013 whether to love them or hurt them, it\u2019s not clear. His story builds to a breathless crescendo in an ending that will both shock and satisfy readers.<br /><i>\n  <br /></i><b>What We All Long For</b> is a gripping and, at times, heart-rending story about identity, longing and loss in a cosmopolitan city. No other writer has presented such a powerful and richly textured portrait of present-day Toronto. Rinaldo Walcott<i> </i>writes in <i>The Globe and Mail</i>: \u201c\u2026 every great city has its literary moments, and contemporary Toronto has been longing for one. We can now say with certainty that we no longer have to long for a novel that speaks this city\u2019s uniqueness: Dionne Brand has given us exactly that.\u201d Donna Bailey Nurse writes in the <i>National Post</i>: \u201c<b>What We All Long For</b><i> </i>is a watershed novel. From now on, Canadian writers will be pressed to portray contemporary Toronto in all its multiracial colour and polyphonic sound.\u201d <br /><br />But <b>What We All Long For</b><i> </i>is not only about a particular city. It\u2019s about the universal experience of being human. As Walcott puts it, \u201cBrand makes us see ourselves differently and anew.

    "description": "Aerial combat brings a thrilling new dimension to the Napoleonic Wars as valiant warriors ride mighty fighting dragons, bred for size or speed. When HMS Reliant captures a French frigate and seizes the precious cargo, an unhatched dragon egg, fate sweeps Captain Will Laurence from his seafaring life into an uncertain future \u2013 and an unexpected kinship with a most extraordinary creature. Thrust into the rarified world of the Aerial Corps as master of the dragon Temeraire, he will face a crash course in the daring tactics of airborne battle. For as France\u2019s own dragon-borne forces rally to breach British soil in Bonaparte\u2019s boldest gambit, Laurence and Temeraire must soar into their own baptism of fire.",

    "description": "<em>We hung the walls with old French movie posters advertising the films of Marcel Pagnol, films that had already provided us with both a name and an ideal: to create a community of friends, lovers, and relatives that span generations and is in tune with the seasons, the land, and human appetites. </em><br /><br />So writes Alice Waters of the opening of Berkeley's Chez Panisse Caf\u00e9 on April Fool's Day, <em>1980</em>. Located above the more formal Chez Panisse Restaurant, the Caf\u00e9 is a bustling neighborhood bistro where guests needn't reserve far in advance and can choose from the ever-changing \u00e0 la carte menu. It's the place where Alice Waters's inventive chefs cook in a more impromptu and earthy vein, drawing on the healthful, low-tech traditions of the cuisines of such Mediterranean regions as Catalonia, Campania, and Provence, while improvising and experimenting with the best products of Chez Panisse's own regional network of small farms and producers<em>.</em><br /><br />In the <em>Chez Panisse Caf\u00e9 Cookbook,</em> the follow-up to the award-winning <em>Chez Panisse Vegetables</em>, Alice Waters and her team of talented cooks offer more than <em>140 </em>of the caf\u00e9's best-recipes--some that have been on the menu since the day caf\u00e9 opened and others freshly reinvented with the honesty and ingenuity that have made Chez Panisse so famous. In addition to irresistible recipes, the <em>Chez Panisse Caf\u00e9 Cookbook</em> is filled with chapter-opening essays on the relationships Alice has cultivated with the farmers, foragers and purveyors--most of them within an hour's drive of Berkeley--who make it possible for Chez Panisse to boast that nearly all food is locally grown, certifiably organic, and sustainably grown and harvested.<br /><br />Alice encourages her chefs and cookbook readers alike to decide what to cook only after visiting the farmer's market or produce stand. Then we can all fully appreciate the advantages of eating according to season--fresh spring lamb in late March, ripe tomato salads in late summer, Comice pear crisps in autumn.<br /><br />This book begins with a chapter of inspired vegetable recipes, from a vivid salad of avocados and beets to elegant Morel Mushroom Toasts to straightforward side dishes of Spicy Broccoli Raab and Garlicky Kale. The Chapter on eggs and cheese includes two of the caf\u00e9's most famous dishes, a garden lettuce salad with baked goat cheese and the Crostata di Perrella, the caf\u00e9's version of a calzone. Later chapters focus on fish and shellfish, beef, pork, lamb, and poultry, each offering its share of delightful dishes. You'll find recipes for curing your own pancetta, for simple grills and succulent braises, and for the definitive simple roast chicken--as well as sumptuous truffed chicken breasts. Finally the pastry cooks of Chez Panisse serve forth a chapter of uncomplicated sweets, including Apricot Bread Pudding, Chocolate Almond Cookies, and Wood Oven-baked Figs with Raspberries.<br /><br />Gorgeously designed and illustrated throughout with colored block prints by David Lance Goines, who has eaten at the caf\u00e9 since the day it opened, <em>Chez Panisse Caf\u00e9 Cookbook</em> is destined to become an indispensable classic. Fans of Alice Waters's restaurant and caf\u00e9 will be thrilled to discover the recipes that keep them coming back for more. Loyal readers of her earlier cookbooks will delight in this latest collection of time-tested, deceptively simple recipes. And anyone who loves pure, vibrant, delicious fare made from the finest ingredients will be honored to add these new recipes to his or her repertoire.",

    "description": "David Mitchell follows his eerily precocious, globe-striding first novel, <i>Ghostwritten</i>, with a work that is in its way even more ambitious. In outward form, <i>number9dream</i> is a Dickensian coming-of-age journey: Young dreamer Eiji Miyake, from remote rural Japan, thrust out on his own by his sister\u2019s death and his mother\u2019s breakdown, comes to Tokyo in pursuit of the father who abandoned him. Stumbling around this strange, awesome city, he trips over and crosses\u2014through a hidden destiny or just monstrously bad luck\u2014a number of its secret power centers. Suddenly, the riddle of his father\u2019s identity becomes just one of the increasingly urgent questions Eiji must answer. Why is the line between the world of his experiences and the world of his dreams so blurry? Why do so many horrible things keep happening to him? What is it about the number 9? To answer these questions, and ultimately to come to terms with his inheritance, Eiji must somehow acquire an insight into the workings of history and fate that would be rare in anyone, much less in a boy from out of town with a price on his head and less than the cost of a Beatles disc to his name.",

    "description": "In this volume, Adrienne Rich pursues her signature themes and takes them further: the discourse between poetry and history, interlocutions within and across gender, dialogues between poets and visual artists, human damages and dignity, and the persistence of utopian visions. Here Rich continues taking the temperature of mind and body in her time in an intimate and yet commanding voice that resonates long after an initial reading. <em>Fox</em> is formidable and moving, fierce and passionate, and one of Rich's most powerful works to date. \"Justly celebrated....Rich has long wanted to set her readers' minds blazing...she succeeds.\"\u2014<em>Publishers Weekly</em> starred review \"Intimate, explorative, these are poems with a millennial feel, at once retrospective and forward-looking.\"\u2014<em>Washington Post Book World</em>",

The pioneers who used to be drawn by the hope of making a fortune from the mines can find easier picking elsewhere. But they still come for the romance of it, or old-fashioned organic mining. Or in the hope of finding the lost treasure of Hamlek Glint - scourge of the spaceways, privateer, adventurer, bandit.<br /><br />Will the TARDIS ever work again? Is Glint's lost treasure waiting to be found? And does the fabled Resurrection Casket, the key to eternal life, really exist? With the help of new friends, and to the horror of new enemies, the Doctor and Rose aim to find out.<br /><br /><i>Featuring the Tenth Doctor and Rose as played by David Tennant and Billie Piper in the acclaimed Doctor Who series from BBC Television.</i>",

Being royally undead isn't all it's cracked up to be - there are still bills to be paid. And Betsy is determined to live as normally as possible, even if it means getting a job. A \"feet\" she accomplishes with panache, landing her dream job selling designer shoes at Macy's.<br /><br />Things couldn't be better - except for her new friends, who keep pestering her while she's on the clock. As if she has time to socialize when there are deliciously sinful shoes to try on - and buy at a discount. It seems that vampires are being murdered in St. Paul, and they're all clamoring for Betsy to do something about it. The worse part is she's going to have to enlist the help of the one vamp who makes her blood boil: the oh-so-sexy Sinclair. Now, she's really treading on dangerous ground - high heels and all...",

    "description": "<i>Pathologies of Power</i> uses harrowing stories of life\u2014and death\u2014in extreme situations to interrogate our understanding of human rights. Paul Farmer, a physician and anthropologist with twenty years of experience working in Haiti, Peru, and Russia, argues that promoting the social and economic rights of the world\u2019s poor is the most important human rights struggle of our times. With passionate eyewitness accounts from the prisons of Russia and the beleaguered villages of Haiti and Chiapas, this book links the lived experiences of individual victims to a broader analysis of structural violence. Farmer challenges conventional thinking within human rights circles and exposes the relationships between political and economic injustice, on one hand, and the suffering and illness of the powerless, on the other.<br /><br />Farmer shows that the same social forces that give rise to epidemic diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis also sculpt risk for human rights violations. He illustrates the ways that racism and gender inequality in the United States are embodied as disease and death. Yet this book is far from a hopeless inventory of abuse. Farmer\u2019s disturbing examples are linked to a guarded optimism that new medical and social technologies will develop in tandem with a more informed sense of social justice. Otherwise, he concludes, we will be guilty of managing social inequality rather than addressing structural violence. Farmer\u2019s urgent plea to think about human rights in the context of global public health and to consider critical issues of quality and access for the world\u2019s poor should be of fundamental concern to a world characterized by the bizarre proximity of surfeit and suffering.",

    "description": "Raskolnikov, an impoverished student living in the St. Petersburg of the tsars, is determined to overreach his humanity and assert his untrammeled individual will. When he commits an act of murder and theft, he sets into motion a story that, for its excruciating suspense, its atmospheric vividness, and its depth of characterization and vision is almost unequaled in the literatures of the world. The best known of Dostoevsky\u2019s masterpieces, Crime and Punishment can bear any amount of rereading without losing a drop of its power over our imaginations.<br /><br />Dostoevsky\u2019s drama of sin, guilt, and redemption transforms the sordid story of an old woman\u2019s murder into the nineteenth century\u2019s profoundest and most compelling philosophical novel.<br /><br />Award-winning translators Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky render this elusive and wildly innovative novel with an energy, suppleness, and range of voice that do full justice to the genius of its creator.",

Never one to be content with yesterday\u2019s baking triumph, however, Peter continues to refine his recipes and techniques in his never-ending quest for extraordinary bread.<br /><br />In <i>The Bread Baker\u2019s Apprentice</i>, Peter shares his latest bread breakthroughs, arising from his study in several of France\u2019s famed <i>boulangeries</i> and the always-enlightening time spent in the culinary academy kitchen with his students. Peer over Peter\u2019s shoulder as he learns from Paris\u2019s most esteemed bakers, like Lionel Poil\u00e2ne and Phillippe Gosselin, whose <i>pain \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne</i> has revolutionized the art of baguette making. Then stand alongside his students in the kitchen as Peter teaches the classic twelve stages of building bread, his clear instructions accompanied by over 100 step-by-step photographs.<br /><br />You\u2019ll put newfound knowledge into practice with 50 new master formulas for such classic breads as rustic <i>ciabatta</i>, hearty <i>pain de campagne</i>, old-school New York bagels, and the book\u2019s Holy Grail\u2013Peter\u2019s version of the famed <i>pain \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne</i>. En route, Peter distills hard science, advanced techniques, and food history into a remarkably accessible and engaging resource that is as rich and multitextured as <br />the loaves you\u2019ll turn out. This is original food writing at its most captivating, teaching at its most inspired and inspiring\u2013and the rewards are some of the best breads under the sun.",

    "description": "Diana Abu-Jaber's vibrant, humorous memoir weaves together delicious food memories that illuminate the two cultures of her childhood--American and Jordanian. Here are stories of being raised by a food-obsessed Jordanian father and tales of Lake Ontario shish kabob cookouts and goat stew feasts under Bedouin tents in the desert. These sensuously evoked repasts, complete with recipes, paint a loving and complex portrait of Diana's impractical, displaced immigrant father who, like many an immigrant before him, cooked to remember the place he came from and to pass that connection on to his children. <i>The Language of Baklava</i> irresistibly invites us to sit down at the table with Diana's family, sharing unforgettable meals that turn out to be as much about \"grace, difference, faith, love\" as they are about food.",

    "description": "Shortly after his arrival in Uganda, Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan is called to the scene of a bizarre accident: Idi Amin, careening down a dirt road in his red Maserati, has run over a cow. When Garrigan tends to Amin, the dictator, in his obsession for all things Scottish, appoints him as his personal physician. And so begins a fateful dalliance with the central African leader whose Emperor Jones-style autocracy would transform into a reign of terror.<br /><br />In <b>The Last King of Scotland</b> Foden's Amin is as ridiculous as he is abhorrent: a grown man who must be burped like an infant, a self-proclaimed cannibalist who, at the end of his 8 years in power, would be responsible for 300,000 deaths. And as Garrigan awakens to his patient's baroque barbarism--and his own complicity in it--we enter a venturesome meditation on conscience, charisma, and the slow corruption of the human heart. Brilliantly written, comic and profound, <b>The Last King of Scotland</b> announces a major new talent.",

    "description": "In the ten years since its publication in 1988, Stephen Hawking's classic work has become a landmark volume in scientific writing, with more than nine million copies in forty languages sold worldwide. That edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book, including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which probed back in time to within 300,000 years of the universe's beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these observations, as well as his own recent research, Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book, written an entirely new chapter on wormholes and time travel, and updated the chapters throughout.",

And it is only the Speaker for the Dead, who is also Ender Wiggin the Xenocide, who has the courage to confront the mystery...and the truth.<br /><br /><br /><b><i>Xenocide</i>:</b><br />The war for survival of the planet Lusitania will be fought in the hearts of a child named Gloriously Bright.<br /><br />On Lusitania, Ender found a world where humans and pequininos and the Hive Queen could all live together; where three very different intelligent species could find common ground at last. Or so he thought.<br /><br />Lusitania also harbors the descolada, a virus that kills all humans it infects, but which the pequininos require in order to become adults. The Startways Congress so fears the effects of the descolada, should it escape from Lusitania, that they have ordered eh destruction of the entire planet, and all who live there. The Fleet is on its way, a second xenocide seems inevitable.<br /><br /><br /><b>\n  <i>Children of the Mind:</i>\n</b><br />The planet Lusitania is home to three sentient species: the Pequeninos; a large colony of humans; and the Hive Queen, brought there by Ender. But once against the human race has grown fearful; the Starways Congress has gathered a fleet to destroy Lusitania.<br /><br />Jane, the evolved computer intelligence, can save the three sentient races of Lusitania. She has learned how to move ships outside the universe, and then instantly back to a different world, abolishing the light-speed limit. But it takes all the processing power available to her, and the Starways Congress is shutting down the Net, world by world.<br /><br />Soon Jane will not be able to move the ships. Ender's children must save her if they are to save themselves.",

    "description": "<i>An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory</i> is a textbook intended for the graduate physics course covering relativistic quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, and Feynman diagrams. The authors make these subjects accessible through carefully worked examples illustrating the technical aspects of the subject, and intuitive explanations of what is going on behind the mathematics. After presenting the basics of quantum electrodynamics, the authors discuss the theory of renormalization and its relation to statistical mechanics, and introduce the renormalization group. This discussion sets the stage for a discussion of the physical principles that underlie the fundamental interactions of elementary particle physics and their description by gauge field theories.",

    "description": "<i>Fable for Another Time</i> is one of the most significant and far-reaching literary texts of postwar France. Composed in the tumultuous aftermath of World War II, largely in the Danish prison cell where the author was awaiting extradition to France on charges of high treason, the book offers a unique perspective on the war, the postwar political purges in France, and Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line\u2019s own dissident politics. \u00a0The tale of a man imprisoned and reviled by his own countrymen, the <i>Fable</i> follows its character\u2019s decline from virulent hatred to near madness as a result of his violent frustration with the hypocrisy and banality of his fellow human beings. In part because of the story\u2019s clear link to his own case\u2014and because of the legal and political difficulties this presented\u2014C\u00e9line was compelled to push his famously elliptical, brilliantly vitriolic language to new and extraordinary extremes in <i>Fable for Another Time.</i> The resulting linguistic and stylistic innovation make this work stand out as one of the most original and revealing literary undertakings of its time.\u00a0Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line (1894\u20131961) was a French writer and physician best known for the novels <i>Journey to the End of the Night</i> (1932) and <i>Death on the Installment Plan</i> (1936). C\u00e9line was accused of collaboration during World War II and fled France in 1944 to live first in Germany, then in Denmark, where he was imprisoned for over a year; an amnesty in 1951 allowed him to return to France. C\u00e9line remains anathema to a large segment of French society for his antisemitic writings; at the same time his novels are enormously admired by each new generation.",

    "description": "In 1975, on the eve of May Day, secret police sealed off a zoo in a small Czechoslovakian town and ordered the destruction of the largest captive herd of giraffes in the world.<br /><br />Ledgard tells the story of the giraffes from the moment of their capture in Africa to their deaths behind the Iron Curtain. We see them first through the eyes of Emil, a haemodynamicist (he studies blood flow in vertical creatures) who is chosen to accompany them from Hamburg into Czechoslovakia. There Amina, a sleepwalker, a factory girl, glimpses their arrival and goes each day to gaze up at them. She is with them at the end, blinding them with a torch, as Jiri, a sharpshooter, brings them down one by one.<br /><br /><i>Giraffe </i>is a story about strangeness, about creatures that are alien. It is also a story about captivity, about Czechoslovakia, a middling totalitarian state in the middle of Europe that is itself asleep, under a spell, a nation of sleepwalkers.",

    "description": "From Shel Silverstein, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Where the Sidewalk Ends</em> and <em>A Light in the Attic, </em>comes a<strong> </strong>poignant picture book about love and acceptance, cherished for over fifty years. This household classic is perfect for both young readers and lifelong fans.<br /><br /><strong>\"Once there was a tree...and she loved a little boy.\"</strong><br /><br />So begins a story of unforgettable perception, beautifully written and illustrated by the gifted and versatile Shel Silverstein. This moving parable for all ages offers a touching interpretation of the gift of giving and a serene acceptance of another's capacity to love in return.<br /><br />Every day the boy would come to the tree to eat her apples, swing from her branches, or slide down her trunk...and the tree was happy. But as the boy grew older he began to want more from the tree, and the tree gave and gave and gave. This is a tender story, touched with sadness, aglow with consolation.",

    "description": "Challenging, with several powerful arguments, some of our deepest beliefs about rationality, morality, and personal identity, Derek Parfit claims that we have a false view about our own nature. It is often rational to act against our own best interests, he argues, and most of us have moral views that are self-defeating. We often act wrongly, although we know there will be no one with serious grounds for complaint, and when we consider future generations it is very hard to avoid conclusions that most of us will find very disturbing.<br />",

    "description": "The first novel of Samuel Beckett's mordant and exhilirating midcentury trilogy intoduces us to Molloy, who has been mysteriously incarcerated, and who subsequently escapes to go discover the whereabouts of his mother. In the latter part of this curious masterwork, a certain Jacques Moran is deputized by anonymous authorities to search for the aforementioned Molloy. In the trilogy's second novel, Malone, who might or might not be Molloy himself, addresses us with his ruminations while in the act of dying. The third novel consists of the fragmented monologue - delivered, like the monologues of the previous novels, in a mournful rhetoric that possesses the utmost splendor and beauty - of what might or might not an armless and legless creature living in an urn outside an eating house. Taken together, these three novels represent the high-water mark of the literary movement we call Modernism. Within their linguistic terrain, where stories are taken up, broken off, and taken up again, where voices rise and crumble and are resurrected, we can discern the essential lineaments of our modern condition, and encounter an awesome vision, tragic yet always compelling and always mysteriously invigorating, of consciousness trapped and struggling inside the boundaries of nature.",

    "description": "\"I have noticed that sometimes I frighten people; what they really fear is themselves. They think it is I who scare them, but it is the dwarf within them, the ape-faced manlike being who sticks up his head from the depths of their souls.\" P\u00e4r Lagerkvist's richly philosophical novel <i>The Dwarf</i> is an exploration of individual and social identity. The novel, set in a time when Italian towns feuded over the outcome of the last feud, centers on a social outcast, the court dwarf PIccoline. From his special vantage point Piccoline comments on the court's prurience and on political intrigue as the town is gripped by a siege. Gradually, Piccoline is drawn deeper and deeper into the conflict, and he inspires fear and hate around him as he grows to represent the fascination of the masses with violence.",

    "description": "When author Andrea Nguyen's family was airlifted out of Saigon in 1975, one of the few belongings that her mother hurriedly packed for the journey was her small orange notebook of recipes. Thirty years later, Nguyen has written her own intimate collection of recipes, INTO THE VIETNAMESE KITCHEN, an ambitious debut cookbook that chronicles the food traditions of her native country. Robustly flavored yet delicate, sophisticated yet simple, the recipes include steamy pho noodle soups infused with the aromas of fresh herbs and lime; rich clay-pot preparations of catfish, chicken, and pork; classic b\u00e1nh m\u00ec sandwiches; and an array of Vietnamese charcuterie. Nguyen helps readers shop for essential ingredients, master core cooking techniques, and prepare and serve satisfying meals, whether for two on a weeknight or 12 on a weekend.",

In this satirical reprise of Kafka, cats, dogs, and breeding rodents are no longer ordinary beings in the happy home, but actually have the power to destroy the world in which we live.",

          "title": "The Drones Club",
          "description": "The Drones Club is in Mayfair, London, located in Dover Street, off Piccadilly. A drone being a male bee that does no work, living off the labour of others, it aptly describes the contemporary Edwardian stereotype of rich, idle young club members. At the same time, though, it should be pointed out that many prominent members do have useful occupations. Pongo Twistleton, for example, is reading for the Bar, and other members are mentioned as holding down jobs.\n    \n    Wodehouse based the Drones Club on a combination of three real London clubs: the Bachelors' Club (existed around the turn of the century), then mostly Buck's Club (established 1919), and a dash of the Bath Club for its swimming pool's ropes and rings. The fictional Drones barman, McGarry, has the same surname as the Buck's first bartender, a Mr McGarry (Buck's barman from 1919 to 1941, credited with creating the Buck's Fizz and Sidecar cocktails). However Evelyn Waugh declared that the Drones did not resemble any real club in 1920s London.[1][2]\n    \n    A real club has been based at 40 Dover Street since 1893, The Arts Club. Other gentlemen's clubs which have existed on Dover Street, but are now dissolved, include the Bath Club, the Junior Naval and Military Club, and the Scottish Club, as well as two mixed-sex clubs, the Albemarle Club and the Empress Club. None of these were ever considered among London's 'premier' clubs of the kind found on St James' Street and Pall Mall, and so their ambience often had something of the raucous informality of the fictional Drones Club.\n    \n    About a dozen club members are major or secondary recurring characters in the Wodehouse stories. In addition to Bertie Wooster (Jeeves stories), Pongo Twistleton (Uncle Fred stories), Rupert Psmith (Psmith stories), and Freddie Threepwood (Blandings stories), prominent recurring drones include Bingo Little and Freddie Widgeon, plus Monty Bodkin, Barmy Fotheringay-Phipps, Tuppy Glossop, Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright, Archibald Mulliner, and the club millionaire Oofy Prosser.",

    "description": "<div>\n  <div>In the fifteenth century, with religious intolerance spreading like wildfire across Europe, English-born Anna Bookman and her grandfather, Finn, earn a living in Prague by illuminating precious books, including forbidden translations of the Bible. Finn subscribes to the heresy that people ought to be able to read the Word of God for themselves, without having to pay a priest for the privilege, but holding that belief is becoming more and more hazardous. When the authorities start burning books and slaughtering heretics---including the man Anna was to marry---Finn urges her to seek sanctuary in England, but her passage abroad will be anything but easy. <br />In London, Friar Gabriel dutifully obeys church doctrine by granting pardons . . . for a small fee. But then he is sent undercover on a spying mission to France, where Anna has set up a temporary stall as a bookseller. Anna has no way of knowing that the wealthy young merchant frequenting her stall is actually a priest---just as Gabriel does not know he has met the woman who will cause him to doubt his vows.<br />As Anna continues her journey to England, where the movement to stamp out heresy is growing ever fiercer, Brenda Rickman Vantrease brings us a richly imagined and immensely rewarding novel of love, faith, and dangerous secrets.</div>\n</div>",

In blousy tops and satin miniskirts she plies her trade as a transvestite rent boy on Picadilly's Meat Rack, risking life and limb among the city's flotsam and jetsam. But it is the 1970s, and fear haunts the streets of London and Belfast -- and as radioactive history approaches critical mass, the coming explosion of violence and tragedy may well blow Pussy's fragile soul asunder.",

From nicotine gum addiction to lesbian personal ads to incontinent dogs, <i>Possible Side Effects</i> mines Burroughs's life in a series of uproariously funny essays. These are stories that are uniquely Augusten, with all the over-the-top hilarity of <i>Running with Scissors,</i> the erudition of <i>Dry,</i> and the breadth of <i>Magical Thinking</i>. A collection that is universal in its appeal and unabashedly intimate, <i>Possible Side Effects </i>continues to explore that which is most personal, mirthful, disturbing, and cherished, with unmatched audacity. A cautionary tale in essay form. Be forewarned--hilarious, troubling, and shocking results might occur.",

    "description": "In Nick Hornby's <i>How to Be Good</i>, Katie Carr is certainly <i>trying</i> to be. That's why she became a GP. That's why she cares about Third World debt and homelessness, and struggles to raise her children with a conscience. It's also why she puts up with her husband David, the self-styled Angriest Man in Holloway. <br /><br />But one fateful day, she finds herself in a Leeds parking lot, having just slept with another man. What Katie doesn't yet realize is that her fall from grace is just the first step on a spiritual journey more torturous than the interstate at rush hour. Because, prompted by his wife's actions, David is about to stop being angry. He's about to become good--not politically correct, organic-food-eating good, but good in the fashion of the Gospels. And that's no easier in modern-day Holloway than it was in ancient Israel. <br /><br />Hornby means us to take his title literally: How can we be good, and what does that mean? However, quite apart from demanding that his readers scrub their souls with the nearest available Brillo pad, he also mesmerizes us with that cocktail of wit and compassion that has become his trademark. The result is a multifaceted jewel of a book: a hilarious romp, a painstaking dissection of middle-class mores, and a powerfully sympathetic portrait of a marriage in its death throes. <br /><br />It's hard to know whether to laugh or cry as we watch David forcing his kids to give away their computers, drawing up schemes for the mass redistribution of wealth, and inviting his wife's most desolate patients round for a Sunday roast. But that's because <i>How to Be Good</i> manages to be both brutally truthful and full of hope. It won't outsell the Bible, but it's a lot funnier. <i>--Matthew Baylis</i>",

Lolita is also the story of a hypercivilized European colliding with the cheerful barbarism of postwar America. Most of all, it is a meditation on love--love as outrage and hallucination, madness and transformation.",

Learn how they did it in a book that is pure Aerosmith unbound: where they came from, what they are now, and what they will always be \u0097 a great American band.</p>",

    "description": "The stories <i>In Persuasion Nation</i> are easily his best work yet. \"The Red Bow,\"about a town consumed by pet-killing hysteria, won a 2004 National Magazine Award and \"Bohemians,\" the story of two supposed Eastern European widows trying to fit in in suburban USA, is included in The Best American Short Stories 2005. His new book includes both unpublished work, and stories that first appeared in The New Yorker, Harper's, and Esquire. The stories in this volume work together as a whole whose impact far exceeds the simple sum of its parts. Fans of Saunders know and love him for his sharp and hilarious satirical eye. But In Persuasion Nation also includes more personal and poignant pieces that reveal a new kind of emotional conviction in Saunders's writing.<br /><br />Saunders's work in the last six years has come to be recognized as one of the strongest-and most consoling-cries in the wilderness of the millennium's political and cultural malaise. <i>In Persuasion Nation</i>'s sophistication and populism should establish Saunders once and for all as this generation's literary voice of wisdom and humor in a time when we need it most.",

    "description": "<i>A room of one's own: is there anybody who hasn't at one time or another wished for such a place, hasn't turned those soft words over until they'd assumed a habitable shape?</i><br /><br />When writer Michael Pollan decided to plant a garden, the result was an award-winning treatise on the borders between nature and contemporary life, the acclaimed bestseller <i>Second Nature</i>. Now Pollan turns his sharp insight to the craft of building, as he recounts the process of designing and constructing a small one-room structure on his rural Connecticut property--a place in which he hoped to read, write and daydream, built with his two own unhandy hands.<br /><br />Invoking the titans of architecture, literature and philosophy, from Vitrivius to Thoreau, from the Chinese masters of feng shui to the revolutionary Frank Lloyd Wright, Pollan brilliantly chronicles a realm of blueprints, joints and trusses as he peers into the ephemeral nature of \"houseness\" itself. From the spark of an idea to the search for a perfect site to the raising of a ridgepole, Pollan revels in the infinitely detailed, complex process of creating a finished structure. At once superbly written, informative and enormously entertaining, <i>A Place of My Own</i> is for anyone who has ever wondered how the walls around us take shape--and how we might shape them ourselves.<br /><br /><i>A Place of My Own</i> recounts his two-and-a-half-year journey of discovery in an absorbing narrative that deftly weaves the day-to-day work of design and building--from siting to blueprint, from the pouring of foundations to finish carpentry--with reflections on everything form the power of place to shape our lives to the question of what constitutes \"real work\" in a technological society.<br /><br />A book about craft that is itself beautifully crafted, linking the world of the body and material things with the realm of mind, heart, and spirit, <i>A Place of My Own</i> has received extraordinary praise.",

    "description": "<b>The Imaginary Invalid</b><p><br />Like many of his characters, Tom Robbins appears to thrive on contradictory stimuli. His last novel, <i>Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas,</i> set its account of spiritual enlightenment and extraterrestrial influences against the credibly rendered backdrop of a faltering stock exchange. His latest, <i>Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates,</i> is also concerned with the quest for enlightenment but chooses for its hero a renegade operative for that supremely unenlightened, reflexively conservative institution, the Central Intelligence Agency.</p><p><br /><br />The operative in question is named, simply, Switters, and he gives new meaning to the phrase \"loose cannon.\" Switters, along with a number of his fellow agents, sees himself as an \"angel,\" a subversive element dedicated to opposing the \"cowboys\" of the CIA, those zealots who have done so much damage in the name of our national interests. A born anarchist, Switters meditates, indulges in mind-altering substances, reads and rereads <a href=\"http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?userid=4DI09SJ0L9&amp;isbn=0141181265\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Finnegans Wake</i></a>, and obsessively ponders the fate of language in the cybernetic future that is rapidly taking shape around us. He is the antithesis of such traditional CIA employees as his pompous\u0097and perfectly named\u0097superior, Mayflower Cabot Fitzgerald.</p><p> <br /><br /><i>Fierce Invalids</i> begins when Switters, who is bound for Peru on Company business, agrees to perform an act of mercy for his octogenarian grandmother, who wants him to return her pet\u0097an aging parrot named Sailor Boy\u0097to its ancestral home in the Amazon rain forest. Switters's mission is interrupted when a British ethnographer\u0097R. Potney Smithe\u0097introduces him to a tribal shaman named, variously, End of Time and Today is Tomorrow, whose head is shaped exactly like a pyramid, and who believes that laughter is one of the animating forces of the universe. Switters spends a single hallucinatory night in End of Time's company, in the course of which he eats his grandmother's parrot and takes a drug-induced trip through \"the Hallways of Always,\" where the secrets of the cosmos reside. In the dazed aftermath of revelation, he learns that arcane knowledge exacts a heavy price. From that day forward, Switters is forbidden\u0097on literal penalty of death\u0097to rest his feet on solid ground.</p><p><br /><br />That is merely the beginning of this wild, unsummarizable tale, a contemporary picaresque in which Switters travels\u0097sometimes by wheelchair, sometimes with the aid of stilts\u0097from one continent to another, finding love, adventure, and spiritual fulfillment as he attempts to come to terms with the magically altered circumstances of his life. His travels take him from Peru to Seattle, from Seattle to Syria, and from Syria to a climactic encounter in Vatican City. Along the way, he encounters a number of bona fide miracles, meets the model for a famous nude portrait by Henri Matisse, uncovers the lost prophecy of the Lady of Fatima, and attempts\u0097with varying degrees of success\u0097to seduce both his 16-year-old stepsister, Suzy, and a 46-year-old cloistered nun named Domino Thiry (pun most definitely intended).</p><p><br /><br />As in most of Robbins's novels, the rambling narrative is designed primarily to accommodate the author's steady stream of observations on the quality of life at the tail end of the 20th century. The result is a baroque, gently didactic novel in which Robbins comments, with wit, acuity, and an increasing sense of personal urgency, on the inadequacy of our political and religious institutions, on the public and private sources of our prevailing spiritual malaise, and on our willing submission to the dictates of a ravenous consumer culture. In the face of all these things, Robbins\u0097like his fictional Peruvian shaman\u0097continues to insist on the primal power of laughter and continues to believe that joy is possible, that dullness of spirit is the one unforgivable sin.</p><p><br /><br />In <i>Fierce Invalids,</i> as in his earlier novels, Robbins's philosophy of joie de vivre is endlessly reflected in the moment-to-moment deployment of his lush, intricate style. There are no dead spaces in a Robbins novel, no drab or perfunctory phrases. Every sentence carries its weight. Every sentence adds something distinctive to the overall ambience of the narrative. Here, for example, is a brief reflection on the quiet pleasures of Seattle's weather:<br /><br /></p><blockquote>[Switters] liked its subtle, muted qualities, and the landscape that those qualities encouraged if not engendered: vistas that seemed to have been sketched with a sumi brush dipped in quicksilver and green tea...</blockquote><br /><br />And here is a smoke ring, its evanescence captured forever:<br /><br /><blockquote>He expelled a dancing doughnut of smoke. Like every smoke ring ever blown\u0097like smoke, in general\u0097it bounced in the air like the bastard baby of chemistry and cartooning.</blockquote><br /><br /><i>Fierce Invalids</i> is animated throughout by the \"mindful playfulness\" that is Robbins's dominant aesthetic characteristic. While it is unlikely to win over his numerous detractors (who will doubtless decry its relentless\u0097and deliberate\u0097\"self-indulgence\"), it will surely strike his many admirers as cause for celebration. Tom Robbins is a genuine original, a philosopher clown whose skewed perspective is both startling and illuminating. Like the best of his earlier books, <i>Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates</i> is humane, funny, and deeply adventurous fiction, a vibrantly comic refutation of the angst-ridden spirit of the age.<p>\u0097Bill Sheehan</p>",

    "description": "It ought to be just a game, but basketball on the playgrounds of Coney Island is much more than that \u2014 for many young men it represents their only hope of escape from a life of crime, poverty, and despair. In The Last Shot, Darcy Frey chronicles the aspirations of four of the neighborhood\u2019s most promising players. What they have going for them is athletic talent, grace, and years of dedication. But working against them are woefully inadequate schooling, family circumstances that are often desperate, and the slick, brutal world of college athletic recruitment. Incisively and compassionately written, The Last Shot introduces us to unforgettable characters and takes us into their world with an intimacy seldom seen in contemporary journalism. The result is a startling and poignant expose of inner-city life and the big business of college basketball.",

    "description": "What does it mean to be an American, and what can America be today?<b> </b>To answer these questions, celebrated philosopher and journalist Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy spent a year traveling throughout the country in the footsteps of another great Frenchman, Alexis de Tocqueville, whose Democracy in America remains the most influential book ever written about our country. <br />The result is<b> </b>American Vertigo, a fascinating, wholly fresh look at a country we sometimes only think we know. From Rikers Island to Chicago mega-churches, from Muslim communities in Detroit to an Amish enclave in Iowa, L\u00e9vy investigates issues at the heart of our democracy: the special nature of American patriotism, the coexistence of freedom and religion (including the religion of baseball), the prison system, the \u201creturn of ideology\u201d and the health of our political institutions, and much more. He revisits and updates Tocqueville\u2019s most important beliefs, such as the dangers posed by \u201cthe tyranny of the majority,\u201d explores what Europe and America have to learn from each other, and interprets what he sees with a novelist\u2019s eye and a philosopher\u2019s depth. <br />Through powerful interview-based portraits across the spectrum of the American people, from prison guards to clergymen, from Norman Mailer to Barack Obama, from Sharon Stone to Richard Holbrooke, L\u00e9vy fills his book with a tapestry of American voices\u2013some wise, some shocking. Both the grandeur and the hellish dimensions of American life are unflinchingly explored. And big themes emerge throughout, from the crucial choices America <br />faces today to the underlying reality that, unlike the \u201cOld World,\u201d America remains the fulfillment of the world\u2019s desire to worship, earn, and live as one wishes\u2013a place, despite all, where inclusion remains not just an ideal but an actual practice.<br />At a time when Americans are anxious about how the world perceives them and, indeed, keen to make sense of themselves, a brilliant and sympathetic foreign observer has arrived to help us begin a new conversation about the meaning of America.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "Cocktails are bigger than ever, and this is the first real cookbook for them, covering the entire breadth of this rich subject. The Craft of the Cocktail provides much more than merely the same old recipes: it delves into history, personalities, and anecdotes; it shows you how to set up a bar, master important techniques, and use tools correctly; and it delivers unique concoctions, many featuring Dale DeGroff's signature use of fresh juices, as well as all the classics. <br />Debonair, a great raconteur, and an unparalleled authority, Dale DeGroff is the epitome of Perfect Bartender, universally acknowledged as the world's premier mixologist. From \"Entertainment Weekly\" and \"USA Today\" to the Culinary Institute of America and the nation's best restaurants, whenever anybody wants information or training on the bar, they turn to Dale for recipes, for history, for anecdotes, for fun--for cocktail-party conversation as well as for cocktails. <br />That's what The Craft of the Cocktail is--the full party, conversation and all. It begins with the history of spirits, how they're made (but without too much boring science), the development of the mixed drink, and the culture it created, all drawn from Dale's vast library of vintage cocktail books. Then on to stocking the essential bar, choosing the right tools and ingredients, mastering key techniques--hints worthy of a pro, the same information that Dale shares with the bartenders he trains in seminars and through his videos. And then the meat of the matter: 500 recipes, including everything from tried-and-true classics to of-the-moment originals. Throughout are rich stories, vintage recipes, fast facts, and other entertaining asides. Beautiful color photographs and a striking design round out the cookbook approach to this subject, highlighting the difference between an under-the-bar handbook and a stylish, full-blown treatment. The Craft of the Cocktail is that treatment, destined to become the bible of the bar.",

    "description": "No one knows better how to give a party than Martha Stewart--and as she proves in this comprehensive and visually dazzling handbook, great parties begin with great hors d'oeuvres. Three hundred all-new recipes, each photographed in full color, show why Martha Stewart is still America's style authority and most trusted party host. <br />It was fifteen years ago that Martha Stewart first turned her creativity and talent for teaching to this subject, when she defined the look and flavor of party appetizers for professionals and home cooks in Martha Stewart's Hors d'Oeuvres. Since then, America's tastes have evolved and Martha's own approach to food has expanded to encompass flavors from around the world, seasonal ingredients fresh from the garden, and innovative preparations all presented with an unsurpassed eye for beauty. <br />In this book, after laying out the basic foundations and techniques, Martha presents chapters on different hors d'oeuvre categories that are brimming with new ideas--Layered and Stacked; Wrapped, Rolled, Filled, Folded, and Stuffed; and Skewered and Threaded. Whether a classic cocktail party food reinvigorated with her wit and style--chicken salad tea sandwiches turned on their sides and encrusted with sesame seeds, for example--or deliciously decadent dips for crudites and seafood updated with Indian dhal or white beans and mustard greens; tiny toasted breadboxes filled with Welsh rarebit; or savory sips of soups in edible cups, these impeccable jewels are as exciting as anything Martha has ever invited her readers to serve on the buffet or tea table or pass among guests. <br />Reflecting Martha's favorite way to entertain now--informal and relaxed--there is also Bites and Pieces, a chapter packed with simple recipes for parties that please the guests without undoing the host. Marinated olives, spiced and seasoned nuts, handmade cheese crackers, and spicy cocktail ribs can be prepared quickly and easily in advance and arranged before the doorbell rings. Even the drinks have been provided: classic and contemporary cocktails, imaginatively garnished, are accompanied by a guide to stocking the bar and serving champagne. <br />Everything about Martha Stewart's Hors d'Oeuvres Handbook has been considered to create a book that is easy to use. The size was chosen to comfortably fit in the hand, in the cookbook holder, or on the kitchen counter. Color photographs in the front of the book help cooks select which hors d'oeuvres to combine for their own parties; the cross-referenced recipes in the back have been tested in Martha's own kitchen and in the test kitchens of Martha Stewart Living; and two place-marking ribbons keep track of both picture and recipe. And every detail has been covered--tips on techniques and ingredients, serving ideas, menu suggestions, recipe variations, advice on party planning, and even a glossary of equipment, special ingredients, and supplies, with a guide to finding them. With its range of recipes, its wealth of ideas, its lavish photography, and its innovative format, Martha Stewart's Hors d'Oeuvres Handbook is simply the most instructive, inspirational, and indispensable guide to hors d'oeuvres ever compiled.",

    "description": "\"Once upon a time there lived in Berlin, Germany, a man called Albinus. He was rich, respectable, happy; one day he abandoned his wife for the sake of a youthful mistress; he loved; was not loved; and his life ended in disaster.\" Thus begins Vladimir Nabokov's Laughter in the Dark; this, the author tells us, is the whole story except that he starts from here, with his characteristic dazzling skill and irony, and brilliantly turns a fable into a chilling, original novel of folly and destruction. Amidst a Weimar-era milieu of silent film stars, artists, and aspirants, Nabokov creates a merciless masterwork as Albinus, an aging critic, falls prey to his own desires, to his teenage mistress, and to Axel Rex, the scheming rival for her affections who finds his greatest joy in the downfall of others. Published first in Russian as Kamera Obskura in 1932, this book appeared in Nabokov's own English translation six years later. This New Directions edition, based on the text as Nabokov revised it in 1960, features a new introduction by Booker Prize-winner John Banville.",
