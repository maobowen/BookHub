    "description": "<div>\n  <div>Based on Dostoevsky's own troubled experiences at the gaming tables, <i>The Gambler</i> is a brilliant and telling portrayal of a man crippled by the overwhelming powers of addiction and obsession. Stationed in the house of a tyrannical Russian general, Aleksei Ivanovich seeks solace in the hypnotic turn of the roulette wheel. Yet, what begins as an idle pastime soon becomes a dangerous obsession, as Ivanovich sinks deeper into debt. Observing his mental and financial ruin are his fellow gamblers\u0097including the hilarious and stunningly observed Grandmama, frittering away her family\u2019s inheritance while those who seek to gain from her death look on with ill-concealed horror. And as passion, hatred, and unadulterated greed rise to the surface, Dostoevsky creates a dark psychological novel of truly extraordinary proportions. Russian novelist and short story writer Fyodor Dostoevsky is one of the greatest, most influential prose writers of all time.</div>\n</div>",

    "description": "Collection of twenty-four stories that generously expresses Murakami\u2019s mastery of the form. From the surreal to the mundane, these stories exhibit his ability to transform the full range of human experience in ways that are instructive, surprising, and relentlessly entertaining. Here are animated crows, a criminal monkey, and an iceman, as well as the dreams that shape us and the things we might wish for. Whether during a chance reunion in Italy, a romantic exile in Greece, a holiday in Hawaii, or in the grip of everyday life, Murakami\u2019s characters confront grievous loss, or sexuality, or the glow of a firefly, or the impossible distances between those who ought to be closest of all.",

It is a singular product of its time, packed full of words and images portraying the architectural projects and metaphysical mechanics that have defined Rem Koolhas's OMA-AMO firm over the past seven years. In the format of a small, thick magazine, this \"book\" is more of an anti-book, an informal tribute the ephemeral world we inhabit. Focusing on the theme \"Go East,\" this visual journey follows OMA-AMO from San Francisco to Tokyo, traversing our massive and turbulent planet in search of \"an opportunity to realize the visions that make remaining at home torturous.\"</div>",

    "description": "In the 1970s, Lucy R. Lippard, author of the highly original and popular<i> Mixed Blessings</i>, merged her art-world concerns with those of the then-fledgling women\u2019s movement. In a career that spans sixteen books and scores of articles, catalogs, and essays on art, political activism, feminism, and multiculturalism, her engaging and provocative writings have heralded a new way of thinking about art and its role in the feminist movement.<br /><br />This new collection of previously published essays covers more than two decades of Lippard\u2019s thinking on the ever-evolving definitions of feminist art, the convergence of high and low art, political and activist art, and the contributions of feminist theory to the politics of identity that infuses the production and exhibition of much of today\u2019s fine and popular art.<br /><br />With a new introduction from the author, <i>The Pink Glass Swan </i>brings together selections from two of Lippard\u2019s leading works, <i>From the Center: Feminist Essays on Art</i> and <i>Get the Message?: A Decade of Art for Social Change</i>, and numerous other articles written for newspapers, magazines, and art catalogs across the country.<br /><br /><br />",

    "description": "One of the most important works of twentieth-century American literature, <i>Zora Neale Hurston's</i> beloved 1937 classic, <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i>, is an enduring Southern love story sparkling with wit, beauty, and heartfelt wisdom. Told in the captivating voice of a woman who refuses to live in sorrow, bitterness, fear, or foolish romantic dreams, it is the story of fair-skinned, fiercely independent Janie Crawford, and her evolving selfhood through three marriages and a life marked by poverty, trials, and purpose. <br />A true literary wonder, Hurston's masterwork remains as relevant and affecting today as when it was first published - perhaps the most widely read and highly regarded novel in the entire canon of African American literature.",

    "description": "<i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i> is a breathtaking story set against the volatile events of Afghanistan's last thirty years\u2014from the Soviet invasion to the reign of the Taliban to post-Taliban rebuilding\u2014that puts the violence, fear, hope, and faith of this country in intimate, human terms. It is a tale of two generations of characters brought jarringly together by the tragic sweep of war, where personal lives\u2014the struggle to survive, raise a family, find happiness\u2014are inextricable from the history playing out around them.<br /><br />Propelled by the same storytelling instinct that made <i>The Kite Runner</i> a beloved classic, <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i> is at once a remarkable chronicle of three decades of Afghan history and a deeply moving account of family and friendship. It is a striking, heart-wrenching novel of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love\u2014a stunning accomplishment.",

    "description": "From the bestselling author of <b>Balkan Ghosts</b> and <b>The Ends of the Earth</b> comes a fascinating new book on the imminent global chaos that is as brilliant as it is necessary, as original as it is controversial.<br /><br />The end of the Cold War has not ushered in the global peace and prosperity that many had anticipated. Environmental degradation is causing the rampant spread of famine and disease, and a rising number of nations are being torn by violent wars of fierce tribalism and trenchant regionalism. Our newest democracies, such as Russia and Venezuela, are bloody maelstroms of violence and crime, while America is beset with an alarmingly high number of apathetic citizens content to concern themselves with matters of entertainment and convenience. Bold, erudite, and profoundly important, <b>The Coming Anarchy</b> is a compelling must-read by one of today's most penetrating writers and provocative minds.<br /><br />\"Analytically daring.... Informed by a rock-solid, unwavering realism and an utter absence of sentimentality.... Kaplan is a knowledgeable and forceful polemicist who mixes the attributes of journalist and visionary.\" \u2014<i>The New York Times<br /><br /></i>\"Ambitiously eclectic.... [Kaplan] is one of America's most engaging writers on contemporary international affairs.\" \u2014<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>",

    "description": "Art and story combine powerfully in this lyrical tale of a young man caught in the maelstrom of the civil rights movement and the entrenched homophobia of small-town America. Toland Polk, the son of an uneducated white carpenter, has grown up in the Southern town of Clayfield. It is the 1960s, a time of passionate beliefs and violent emotions, and Clayfield's citizens are divided in the fight over segregation. As Toland fights on the side of the civil rights activists, he slowly begins to realize that he also has a more personal battle - to accept that he is gay.<br /><br />With a subtle yet intricate plot, and distinctively evocative illustrations, \"Stuck Rubber Baby\" is an unflinching honest look at one man's world of fears, dreams, and prejudice.",

    "description": "Created in 1951 to ensure the future of an embattled Israel, the Mossad has been responsible for the most audacious and thrilling feats of espionage, counterterrorism, and assassination ever ventured. Gordon Thomas's 1999 publication of <i>Gideon's Spies</i>, resulting from closed-door interviews with Mossad agents, informants, and spymasters as well as from classified documents and top-secret sources, revealed previously untold truths about the Israeli intelligence agency. And now, in this edition, Thomas updates his classic text and shows the Mossad as it truly is: brilliant, ruthless, and flawed, but ultimately awesome.<br /><br />Three all-new chapters cover topics including:<br /><br />- How the Mossad planned to assassinate Saddam Hussein<br />- Saddam's food-testing ritual, and the surprising \"source\" within his government<br />- China's U.S.-based front-companies, and its relationship with bin Laden<br />- Mossad's untold role in the events before and after 9/11<br />- Mossad and revelations about Princess Diana's death<br />- The disappearance of the millions transferred from the Vatican Bank to the Polish Solidarity movement<br />- How extremists recruit suicide bombers, including women<br />- Mossad's untold role in the Iraq war and the hunts for Saddam and bin Laden<br />- Saddam's plans for trial<br />",

    "description": "Pulsating with the rhythms of fifties underground America, jazz, sex, illicit drugs, and the mystery and promise of the open road, Jack Kerouac's classic novel of freedom and longing defined what it meant to be \"Beat,\" and has inspired every generation since its initial publication in 1957. Based on Kerouac's adventures with Neal Cassady, <i> On the Road</i> tells the story of two friends, whose four cross-country road trips are a quest for meaning and true experience. Written with a mixture of sad-eyed naivete and wild abandon, and imbued with Kerouac's love of America, his compassion for humanity, and his sense of language as jazz, <i>One the Road</i> is the quintessential American vision of freedom and hope-vibrant, compelling, and full of wonder.",

    "description": "Combining epigrammatic brilliance and shrewd social observation, the works collected in Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays are edited with an introduction, commentaries and notes by Richard Allen Cave in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />'To lose one parent may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness'<br /><br />The Importance of Being Earnest is a glorious comedy of mistaken identity, which ridicules codes of propriety and etiquette. Manners and morality are also victims of Wilde's sharp wit in Lady Windermere's Fan, A Woman of No Importance and An Ideal Husband, in which snobbery and hypocrisy are laid bare. In Salom\u00e9 and A Florentine Tragedy, Wilde makes powerful use of historical settings to explore the complex relationship between sex and power. The range of these plays displays Wilde's delight in artifice, masks and disguises, and reveals the pretentions of the social world in which he himself played such a dazzling and precarious part.<br /><br />Richard Allen Cave's introduction and notes discuss the themes of the plays and Wilde's innovative methods of staging. This edition includes the excised 'Gribsby' scene from The Importance of Being Earnest.",

Spud accepts Lymie\u2019s devotion without questioning it, but once high school ends and the boys enter college, tensions begin to arise between them. Lymie is the first to meet Sally Forbes, but she will fall in love with Spud, and this will mark the beginning of the rift between them. But this rupture will be more than Lymie can bear. William Maxwell provides the reader with a moving portrayal of adolescence and the shift from youth into adulthood.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\n    <i>En los suburbios de Chicago en los a\u00f1os veinte, dos chicos inician una ins\u00f3lita amistad: Lymie Peters, un muchacho delgado y un poco torpe que siempre saca buenas notas, y el reci\u00e9n llegado Spud Latham, un aut\u00e9ntico atleta y estudiante mediocre. Spud acepta la devoci\u00f3n de Lymie sin cuestionarla, pero al terminar la escuela secundaria y comenzar la universidad, aparecen las primeras tensiones entre ellos. Lymie es el primero en conocer a Sally Forbes, pero ella se enamorar\u00e1 de Spud, y este hecho marcar\u00e1 el inicio del distanciamiento entre los dos amigos. Pero la ruptura es m\u00e1s de lo que Lymie podr\u00e1 soportar. He aqu\u00ed un conmovedor retrato de la adolescencia y el paso de la juventud a la edad adulta.</i>\n  </p>\n</div>",

So how in the world does Ramona get in trouble? Why does Davy run away whenever Ramona comes near him? And how does she manage to disrupt the whole kindergarten class during their rest time? Beverly Cleary is one of America's most popular authors and has won many prestigious awards, including the American Library Association's Laura Ingalls Wilder Award. Ramona the Pest is being published to coincide with the publication of the lastest Ramona title, Ramona's World.",

    "description": "From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Da Vinci Code comes the explosive thriller that started it all.<br /><br />An ancient secret brotherhood. A devastating new weapon of destruction. An unthinkable target. When world-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to his first assignment to a Swiss research facility to analyze a mysterious symbol -- seared into the chest of a murdered physicist -- he discovers evidence of the unimaginable: the resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati...the most powerful underground organization ever to walk the earth. The Illuminati has now surfaced to carry out the final phase of its legendary vendetta against its most hated enemy -- the Catholic Church.<br /><br />Langdon's worst fears are confirmed on the eve of the Vatican's holy conclave, when a messenger of the Illuminati announces they have hidden an unstoppable time bomb at the very heart of Vatican City. With the countdown under way, Langdon jets to Rome to join forces with Vittoria Vetra, a beautiful and mysterious Italian scientist, to assist the Vatican in a desperate bid for survival.<br /><br />Embarking on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and the most secretive vault on earth, Langdon and Vetra follow a 400-year-old trail of ancient symbols that snakes across Rome toward the long-forgotten Illuminati lair...a clandestine location that contains the only hope for Vatican salvation.<br /><br />Critics have praised the exhilarating blend of relentless adventure, scholarly intrigue, and cutting wit found in Brown's remarkable thrillers featuring Robert Langdon. An explosive international suspense, Angels &amp; Demons marks this hero's first adventure as it careens from enlightening epiphanies to dark truths as the battle between science and religion turns to war.<br />(from the jacket)",

    "description": "Majestically told and based on materials not available to any previous biographer, the definitive life of Andrew Carnegie-one of American business's most iconic and elusive titans-by the bestselling author of <i>The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst</i>. <br /><br /> Celebrated historian David Nasaw, whom <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> has called \"a meticulous researcher and a cool analyst,\" brings new life to the story of one of America's most famous and successful businessmen and philanthropists- in what will prove to be the biography of the season. <br /><br /> Born of modest origins in Scotland in 1835, Andrew Carnegie is best known as the founder of Carnegie Steel. His rags to riches story has never been told as dramatically and vividly as in Nasaw's new biography. Carnegie, the son of an impoverished linen weaver, moved to Pittsburgh at the age of thirteen. The embodiment of the American dream, he pulled himself up from bobbin boy in a cotton factory to become the richest man in the world. He spent the rest of his life giving away the fortune he had accumulated and crusading for international peace. For all that he accomplished and came to represent to the American public-a wildly successful businessman and capitalist, a self-educated writer, peace activist, philanthropist, man of letters, lover of culture, and unabashed enthusiast for American democracy and capitalism-Carnegie has remained, to this day, an enigma. <br /><br /> Nasaw explains how Carnegie made his early fortune and what prompted him to give it all away, how he was drawn into the campaign first against American involvement in the Spanish-American War and then for international peace, and how he used his friendships with presidents and prime ministers to try to pull the world back from the brink of disaster. <br /><br /> With a trove of new material-unpublished chapters of Carnegie's <i>Autobiography</i>; personal letters between Carnegie and his future wife, Louise, and other family members; his prenuptial agreement; diaries of family and close friends; his applications for citizenship; his extensive correspondence with Henry Clay Frick; and dozens of private letters to and from presidents Grant, Cleveland, McKinley, Roosevelt, and British prime ministers Gladstone and Balfour, as well as friends Herbert Spencer, Matthew Arnold, and Mark Twain-Nasaw brilliantly plumbs the core of this facinating and complex man, deftly placing his life in cultural and political context as only a master storyteller can.",

It portrays the events surrounding the marriage of the Duke of Athens, Theseus, and the Queen of the Amazons, Hippolyta. These include the adventures of four young Athenian lovers and a group of amateur actors, who are manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest in which most of the play is set. The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world.",

Two years later, seventeen satellites are sent into the outer fringes of space to collect organisms and dust for study. One of them falls to earth, landing in a desolate area of Arizona. Twelve miles from the landing site, in the town of Piedmont, a shocking discovery is made: the streets are littered with the dead bodies of the town's inhabitants, as if they dropped dead in their tracks.",

But recently, her behavior has been erratic and her drawings match, with stunning accuracy, the brittle pages of a Portuguese print dating back to 1642 . . . a drawing of an ancient lost city. A new expedition \u2014 along with Amy \u2014 is sent into the Congo where they enter a secret world, and the only way out may be through a horrifying death \u2026<br />source: michaelcrichton.com",

    "description": "Throughout the centuries, royal mistresses have been worshiped, feared, envied, and reviled. They set the fashions, encouraged the arts, and, in some cases, ruled nations. Eleanor Herman's Sex with Kings takes us into the throne rooms and bedrooms of Europe's most powerful monarchs. Alive with flamboyant characters, outrageous humor, and stirring poignancy, this glittering tale of passion and politics chronicles five hundred years of scintillating women and the kings who loved them.<br /><br />Curiously, the main function of a royal mistress was not to provide the king with sex but with companionship. Forced to marry repulsive foreign princesses, kings sought solace with women of their own choice. And what women they were! From Madame de Pompadour, the famous mistress of Louis XV, who kept her position for nineteen years despite her frigidity, to modern-day Camilla Parker-Bowles, who usurped none other than the glamorous Diana, Princess of Wales.<br /><br />The successful royal mistress made herself irreplaceable. She was ready to converse gaily with him when she was tired, make love until all hours when she was ill, and cater to his every whim. Wearing a mask of beaming delight over any and all discomforts, she was never to be exhausted, complaining, or grief-stricken.<br /><br />True, financial rewards for services rendered were of royal proportions -- some royal mistresses earned up to $200 million in titles, pensions, jewels, and palaces. Some kings allowed their mistresses to exercise unlimited political power. But for all its grandeur, a royal court was a scorpion's nest of insatiable greed, unquenchable lust, and vicious ambition. Hundreds of beautiful women vied to unseat the royal mistress. Many would suffer the slings and arrows of negative public opinion, some met with tragic ends and were pensioned off to make room for younger women. But the royal mistress often had the last laugh, as she lived well and richly off the fruits of her \"sins.\"<br /><br />From the dawn of time, power has been a mighty aphrodisiac. With diaries, personal letters, and diplomatic dispatches, Eleanor Herman's trailblazing research reveals the dynamics of sex and power, rivalry and revenge, at the most brilliant courts of Europe. Wickedly witty and endlessly entertaining, Sex with Kings is a chapter of women's history that has remained unwritten -- until now.",

    "description": "<em>Maldoror</em> is a long narrative prose poem which celebrates the principle of Evil in an elaborate style and with a passion akin to religions fanaticism. The French poet-critic Georges Hugnet has written of Lautr\u00e9amont: \"He terrifies, stupefies, strikes dumb. He could look squarely at that which others had merely given a passing glance.\" When first published in 1868-69, <em>Maldoror</em> went almost unnoticed. But in the 1890s the book was rediscovered and hailed as a work of genius by such eminent writers as Huysmans, L\u00e9on Block, Maeterlinck, and R\u00e9my de Gourmont. Later still, Lautr\u00e9amont was to be canonized as one of their principal \"ancestors\" by the Paris surrealists. This edition, translated by Guy Wernham, includes also a long introduction to a never-written, or now lost, volume of poetry. Thus, except for a few letters, it gives all the surviving literary work of Lautr\u00e9amont.",

    "description": "The heroine of this love story is Madelene Burden. Lonely and disillusioned despite her upper-crust London existence, she's a modern-day sleeping beauty drowsing gently in an alcoholic stupor. But the prince whose kiss brings her to life is not tall, dark, and handsome. He's a short, dark, 300-pound ape named Erasmus. The victim of a smuggling attempt gone awry, Erasmus is brought to Madelene's home; her husband, Adam, a distinguished behavioral scientist, believes the ape's sophisticated intelligence renders him more human than animal. If he is right, Erasmus would be a most lucrative addition to Adam's new zoo. But Madelene is determined to save Erasmus from a series of inhumane tests that would rob the ape of the very qualities that makes him so un-apelike. Pursuing this goal with all the energy she had previously reserved for her drinking, Madelene's compassion turns to passion and woman and beast escape and fall in love. But Erasmus has come to England with a purpose that eventually forces the couple to face the world they have sought to flee.Enthralling readers with the same taut prose, enigmatic characters, thrilling suspense, and satirical humor that drove Smilla to the top of bestseller lists across the country, Peter Hoeg offers a daring and imaginative fable that poses searching questions about the nature of romance, freedom and humanity. Above all, it is a love story as erotically charged and emotionally powerful as any you will ever read.",

So she set out to make a new life for herself. But breaking with \"The Tradition\" was no easy matter--until she got a little help from her own fairy godmother. Who promptly offered Elena a most unexpected job...<br /><br />Now, instead of sleeping in the chimney, she has to deal with arrogant, stuffed-shirt princes who keep trying to rise above their place in the tale. And there's one in particular who needs to be dealt with...<br /><br />Sometimes a fairy godmother's work is never done...",

    "description": "A woman in her forties is a victim of a suicide bombing at a Jerusalem market. Her body lies nameless in a hospital morgue. She had apparently worked as a cleaning woman at a bakery, but there is no record of her employment. When a Jerusalem daily accuses the bakery of \"gross negligence and inhumanity toward an employee,\" the bakery's owner, overwhelmed by guilt, entrusts the task of identifying and burying the victim to a human resources man. This man is at first reluctant to take on the job, but as the facts of the woman's life take shape-she was an engineer from the former Soviet Union, a non-Jew on a religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and, judging by an early photograph, beautiful-he yields to feelings of regret, atonement, and even love.<br /><br />At once profoundly serious and highly entertaining, A. B. Yehoshua astonishes us with his masterly, often unexpected turns in the story and with his ability to get under the skin and into the soul of Israel today. <br /><br />",

    "description": "\"The longing for a destiny is nowhere stronger than in our romantic life\" we are told at the outset of Alain de Botton's On Love, a hip, charming, and devastatingly witty rumination on the thrills and pitfalls of romantic love. <br /><br />The narrator is smitten by Chloe on a Paris-London flight, and by the time they've reached the luggage carousel, he knows he is in love. He loves her chestnut hair and pale nape and watery green eyes, the way she drives a car and eats Chinese food, the gap that makes her teeth Kantian and not Platonic, her views on Heidegger's Being and Time - although he hates her taste in shoes. <br />On Love plots the course of their affair from the initial delirium of infatuation to the depths of suicidal despair, through the (Groucho) \"Marxist\" stage of coming to terms with being loved by the unattainable beloved, through a fit of anhedonia, defined in medical texts as a disease resulting from the terror brought on by the threat of utter happiness, and finally through the nausea induced and terrorist tactics employed when the beloved begins, inexplicably, to drift away. <br /><br />Alain de Botton is simultaneously hilarious and intellectually astute, shifting with ease among such seminal romantic texts as The Divine Comedy, Madame Bovary, and The Bleeding Heart, a self-help book for those who love too much. He is schematically flawless, funny, funky, and totally engaging. <br />Filled with profound observations and useful diagrams, On Love displays and examines for all of us the pain and exhilaration of love, asking, \"Can we not be forgiven if we believe ourselves fated to stumble one day upon the man or woman of our dreams? Can we not be excused a certain superstitious faith in a creature who will prove the solution to our relentless yearnings?\"",

    "description": "<p>Hilarious, terrifying, insightful, and compulsively readable, these are the articles that Hunter S. Thompson wrote for <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine while covering the 1972 election campaign of President Richard M. Nixon and his unsuccessful opponent, Senator George S. McGovern. Hunter focuses largely on the Democratic Party's primaries and the breakdown of the national party as it splits between the different candidates.<br /><br /></p><p>With drug-addled alacrity and incisive wit, Thompson turned his jaundiced eye and gonzo heart to the repellent and seductive race for president, deconstructed the campaigns, and ended up with a political vision that is eerily prophetic</p>",

    "description": "At the start of this edgy and ambitiously multilayered novel, a fashion model named Charlotte Swenson emerges from a car accident in her Illinois hometown with her face so badly shattered that it takes eighty titanium screws to reassemble it. She returns to New York still beautiful but oddly unrecognizable, a virtual stranger in the world she once effortlessly occupied.<br /><br />With the surreal authority of a David Lynch, Jennifer Egan threads Charlotte\u2019s narrative with those of other casualties of our infatuation with the image. There\u2019s a deceptively plain teenaged girl embarking on a dangerous secret life, an alcoholic private eye, and an enigmatic stranger who changes names and accents as he prepares an apocalyptic blow against American society. As these narratives inexorably converge, <b>Look at Me</b> becomes a coolly mesmerizing intellectual thriller of identity and imposture.",

    "description": "<i>The Trial</i> tells the terrifying tale of Joseph K., a respectable functionary in a bank who is suddenly arrested and must defend his innocence against a charge about which he can get no information. Whether read as an existential tale, a parable, or a prophecy, this hauntingly believable story stands out as one of the great novels of our times. Kafka's unsurpassed nightmare vision rings with chilling truth as it foreshadows the excesses of modern bureaucracy wedded to the mad agendas of twentieth-century totalitarian regimes.<br /><br />This definitive edition includes Kafka's own drawings, as well as excerpts from his diaries during the period in which he wrote <i>The Trial</i>.",

For this collection Joel-Peter Witkin has personally selected from his own archives his finest images, ranging from his early Coney Island \"freak show\" studies to his most recent work. Witkin's portraits of subjects both living and dead have disturbed countless viewers for their unwavering viewpoint and magically grotesque compositions. The artist's sojourn captured here, with each photograph a station along his path, veers between oblivion and salvation. This book depicts Witkin's journey until now. Texts by the artist and Eugenia Parry.",

But as the Invisibles look to rest and regroup, they soon discover that this fight had far greater effects than their physical casualties. With King Mob growing even more violent and their leader Ragged Robin continuing to hide many secrets, the Invisibles find themselves dealing with time distortions, secret government installations, and their own warped pasts as they try to uncover the truth about the mind-controlling dwarf called Quimper.

Through clandestine movements, a sinister secret organization has been creating a hypnotic state of conformity and control through their manipulation of the government, business, and entertainment industry. But from the shadows, a subversive group of anarchists called the Invisibles have opposed their plot and looked to create self-awareness and freedom through disobedience. Now with the fate of all mankind hanging in the balance, the secret freedom fighting cult make their final rebellious stand in the war of control versus chaos. Collects Volume 3, Issues #1-12",

But they are just the program's prototypes, and now that their testing is complete, they're slated to be permanently \"de-commissioned\"-until they seize their one chance to make a desperate run for freedom. Relentlessly pursued by their makers, the WE3 team must navigate a frightening and confusing world where their instincts and heightened abilities make them as much a threat as those hunting them-but a world, nonetheless, in which somewhere there is something called \"home.\"",

    "description": "Alexandra Robbins wanted to find out if the stereotypes about sorority girls were actually true, so she spent a year with a group of girls in a typical sorority. The sordid behavior of sorority girls exceeded her worst expectations-drugs, psychological abuse, extreme promiscuity, racism, violence, and rampant eating disorders are just a few of the problems. But even more surprising was the fact that these abuses were inflicted and endured by intelligent, successful, and attractive women. Why is the desire to belong to a sorority so powerful that women are willing to engage in this type of behavior-especially when the women involved are supposed to be considered 'sisters'? What definition of sisterhood do many women embrace? Pledged combines a sharp-eyed narrative with extensive reporting and the fly-on-the-wall voyeurism of reality shows to provide the answer.",

    "description": "Plum Sykes beguiling debut welcomes readers to the glamorous world of Park Avenue Princesses, the girls who careen through Manhattan in search of the perfect Fake Bake (tan acquired from Portofino Tanning Salon), a ride on a PJ (private jet) with the ATM (rich boyfriend), and the ever-elusive fiance. <br /><br />With invitations to high-profile baby showers and benefits, more Marc Jacobs clothes than is decent, and a department store heiress for a best friend, our heroine known only as Moi is living at the peak of New York society. But what is Moi to do when her engagement falls apart? Can she ever find happiness in a city filled with the distractions of Front Row Girls, dermatologists, premieres, and eyebrow waxes? Is it possible to find love in a town where her friends think that the secret to happiness is getting invited to the Van Cleef and Arpels private sample sale? And how is she going to deal with the endless phone calls from her mother in England demanding that she get married to the Earl next door?<br /><br />With enormous wit and an insider's eye, Sykes captures the nuances of the rich and spoiled in a heartwarming social satire, featuring a loveable \"champagne bubble of a girl\" who's just looking for love (and maybe the perfect pair of Chloe jeans).",

Here is a captivating slice of Americana - part sporting event, part absorbing human drama, and part celebration of the magic of words.</i><br /><br />Every spring in the nation's capital, after a starting pool of 10 million kids narrows to 250 finalists, America's top young spellers face off in a nail-biting contest. So electric is the drama that millions of viewers tune in to watch ESPN's live telecast<br /><br />But this national obsession is much more than a sporting story - and this first-ever narrative nonfiction book about the National Spelling Bee immerses the reader in unique subculture, portraying the endearing fraternity of brilliant, eccentric young word nerds who vie for a gold trophy, a hefty check, and a glorious moment of national fame.<br /><br />Author James Maguire, who like the contestants is an inveterate word nut, captures the agony and glory of this singularly American event. He profiles the top five spellers across the country, exploring their hopes and dreams - and strategies for winning - as they prepare for their moment in the spotlight. <i>American Bee</i> takes readers behind the scenes at the National Bee, providing a narrative thrill ride as the tension mounts round by round.",

Reluctantly agreeing to marry Mrs Haze just to be close to Lolita, Humbert suffers greatly in the pursuit of romance; but when Lo herself starts looking for attention elsewhere, he will carry her off on a desperate cross-country misadventure, all in the name of Love. Hilarious, flamboyant, heart-breaking and full of ingenious word play, Lolita is an immaculate, unforgettable masterpiece of obsession, delusion and lust.",

    "description": "<i>Pound for Pound</i> is a big novel in the truest sense of the word, a story of family, honor, perseverance, and forgiveness. Set in towns where violence is the norm and success stories take on an almost mythic importance, it tells of grandfathers and grandsons\u2014older men for whom life has not been easy and the young men who look to them for guidance \u2014and reveals the transformative power of that relationship. Dan Cooley, an aging but legendary Los Angeles trainer, takes on a troubled young fighter named Chicky Garza, hungry to make a name for himself in the San Antonio boxing circuit, which is rife with crime and corruption. The bond between them grows more powerful than the obstacles they face, ultimately reviving in each man the courage it takes to triumph both in and out of the ring.<br /><br />This masterful, posthumous novel follows Toole's remarkable fiction debut, <i>Rope Burns</i> (recently published in paperback as <i>Million Dollar Baby</i>), which earned comparisons to Ernest Hemingway, Raymond Carver, and Frank McCourt, and which became an Academy Award-winning film four years after publication. As James Ellroy says in the foreword, \u201cF. X. Toole did not live to visit the set or hug the stars at the premiere. The rumor was true. He had a bum ticker.\u201d It is a tragedy that the world will not hear more from F. X. Toole, but <i>Pound for Pound</i> is a novel that any writer would be proud to leave behind, marking his place in the world of letters.",

As children Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy were students at Hailsham, an exclusive boarding school secluded in the English countryside. It was a place of mercurial cliques and mysterious rules where teachers were constantly reminding their charges of how special they were. <br /><br />Now, years later, Kathy is a young woman. Ruth and Tommy have reentered her life. And for the first time she is beginning to look back at their shared past and understand just what it is that makes them special\u2013and how that gift will shape the rest of their time together. Suspenseful, moving, beautifully atmospheric, <i>Never Let Me Go</i> is another classic by the author of <i>The Remains of the Day</i>.",

Discover for yourself what such great Christian minds as Bill Hybels, Josh McDowell and Ravi Zacharias have found to be a must-have classic for any critical thinker's library.",

    "description": "<strong>Four beloved Ramona books in one fun box!</strong><br /><br />The appeal of Beverly Cleary\u2019s stories about the wonderful, blunderful Ramona Quimby has never faded. Each new generation feels connected to Ramona\u2019s unique way of looking at the world as she tries to adjust to new teachers, feels jealous about Susan's curls, and is secretly pleased by Yard Ape's teasing.<br /><br />The scrapes she gets herself into\u2014like wearing pajamas to school or accidentally making egg yolk shampoo\u2014are funny and heartwarming, and sometimes embarrassing. No matter what, Ramona\u2019s lively, curious spirit shines through. Now, with lively art by Jacqueline Rogers, here are four of Beverly Cleary\u2019s favorite Ramona titles in one collection!<br /><br />This collection includes\u00a04 complete paperbacks:<br /><br /><br />Beezus and Ramona<br />Ramona the Pest<br />Ramona the Brave<br />Ramona and Her Father",

In ABC's prime time hit series and in her first book, Jo works magic on problem children. The Supernanny method gives parents the tools to tackle any problem, be it mealtime, bathtime, bedtime, bedwetting, homework, sibling rivalry, aggressive behavior, or a child who just won't do what he or she is told. This follow up to the original <i>Supernanny</i> will be in a Q&amp;A format, and will include Jo's A to Z for positive reminders of good parenting, tips and practical solutions for family dynamics, mealtimes, bedtimes, home and away, and much more.",

    "description": "<i>A time-travel story that is both a poignant exploration of human identity and an absorbing tale of suspense.</i><br /><br />It's natural to feel a little out of place when you're the new girl, but when Charlotte Makepeace wakes up after her first night at boarding school, she's baffled: everyone thinks she's a girl called Clare Mobley, and even more shockingly, it seems she has traveled forty years back in time to 1918. In the months to follow, Charlotte wakes alternately in her own time and in Clare's. And instead of having only one new set of rules to learn, she also has to contend with the unprecedented strangeness of being an entirely new person in an era she knows nothing about. Her teachers think she's slow, the other girls find her odd, and, as she spends more and more time in 1918, Charlotte starts to wonder if she remembers how to be Charlotte at all. If she doesn't figure out some way to get back to the world she knows before the end of the term, she might never have another chance.",

Your father-in-law insists that married women have to take their husbands' names. Your guests plead that asking them to commit themselves to attending your party ruins the spontaneity. Who is right? Miss Manners, of course. With all those amateurs issuing unauthorized etiquette pronouncements, aren't you glad that there is a gold standard to consult about what has really changed and what has not? The freshly updated version of the classic bestseller includes the latest letters, essays, and illustrations, along with the laugh-out-loud wisdom of Miss Manners as she meets the new millennium of American misbehavior head-on. This wickedly witty guide rules on the challenges brought about by our ever-evolving society, once again proving that etiquette, far from being an optional extra, is the essential currency of a civilized world.",

    "description": "Brilliantly uniting the personal and the critical, <i>French Lessons</i> is a powerful autobiographical experiment. It tells the story of an American woman escaping into the French language and of a scholar and teacher coming to grips with her history of learning. Kaplan begins with a distinctly American quest for an imaginary France of the intelligence. But soon her infatuation with all things French comes up against the dark, unimagined recesses of French political and cultural life.<br /><br />The daughter of a Jewish lawyer who prosecuted Nazi war criminals at Nuremburg, Kaplan grew up in the 1960s in the Midwest. After her father's death when she was seven, French became her way of \"leaving home\" and finding herself in another language and culture. In spare, midwestern prose, by turns intimate and wry, Kaplan describes how, as a student in a Swiss boarding school and later in a junior year abroad in Bordeaux, she passionately sought the French \"r,\" attentively honed her accent, and learned the idioms of her French lover.<br /><br />When, as a graduate student, her passion for French culture turned to the elegance and sophistication of its intellectual life, she found herself drawn to the language and style of the novelist Louis-Ferdinand Celine. At the same time she was repulsed by his anti-Semitism. At Yale in the late 70s, during the heyday of deconstruction she chose to transgress its apolitical purity and work on a subject \"that made history impossible to ignore:\" French fascist intellectuals. Kaplan's discussion of the \"de Man affair\" \u2014 the discovery that her brilliant and charismatic Yale professor had written compromising articles for the pro-Nazi Belgian press\u2014and her personal account of the paradoxes of deconstruction are among the most compelling available on this subject.<br /><br /><i>French Lessons</i> belongs in the company of Sartre's <i>Words</i> and the memoirs of Nathalie Sarraute, Annie Ernaux, and Eva Hoffman. No book so engrossingly conveys both the excitement of learning and the moral dilemmas of the intellectual life.",

    "description": "Convinced he is destined for greatness, Glyver will stop at nothing to win back a prize that he knows is rightfully his. A story of betrayal and treachery, of death and delusion, of ruthless obsession and ambition.<br /><br />The atmosphere of Bleak House, the sensuous thrill of Perfume, and the mystery of Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell all combine in a story of murder, deceit, love, and revenge in Victorian England.<br /><br />\"After killing the red-haired man, I took myself off to Quinn's for an oyster supper.\"<br /><br />So begins the extraordinary story of Edward Glyver--booklover, scholar, and murderer. As a young boy, Glyver always believed he was destined for greatness. A chance discovery convinces him that he was right: greatness does await him, along with immense wealth and influence. Overwhelmed by his discovery, he will stop at nothing to win back a prize that he knows is rightfully his.<br /><br />Glyver's path to reclaim his prize leads him from the depths of Victorian London, with its foggy streets, brothels, and opium dens, to Evenwood, one of England's most beautiful and enchanting country houses, and finally to a consuming love for the beautiful but enigmatic Emily Carteret. His is a story of betrayal and treachery, of death and delusion, of ruthless obsession and ambition. And at every turn, driving Glyver irresistibly onward, is his deadly rival: the poet-criminal Phoebus Rainsford Daunt.<br /><br />The Meaning of Night is an enthralling novel that will captivate readers right up to its final thrilling revelation.",

    "description": "A beloved American writer whose books are championed by critics and readers alike, Sherman Alexie has been hailed by Time as \"one of the better new novelists, Indian or otherwise.\" <br /><br />In these stories, we meet the kind of American Indians we rarely see in literature -- the kind who pay their bills, hold down jobs, fall in and out of love. <br /><br />A Spokane Indian journalist transplanted from the reservation to the city picks up a hitchhiker, a Lummi boxer looking to take on the toughest Indian in the world. A Spokane son waits for his diabetic father to come home from the hospital, tossing out the Hershey Kisses the father has hidden all over the house. An estranged interracial couple, separated in the midst of a traffic accident, rediscover their love for each other. A white drifter holds up an International House of Pancakes, demanding a dollar per customer and someone to love, and emerges with $42 and an overweight Indian he dubs Salmon Boy. <br /><br />Sherman Alexie's voice is one of remarkable passion, and these stories are love stories -- between parents and children, white people and Indians, movie stars and ordinary people. Witty, tender, and fierce, <i>The Toughest Indian in the World</i> is a virtuoso performance by one of the country's finest writers.",

    "description": "When her father leaves the Church in a crisis of conscience, Margaret Hale is uprooted from her comfortable home in Hampshire to move with her family to the north of England. Initially repulsed by the ugliness of her new surroundings in the industrial town of Milton, Margaret becomes aware of the poverty and suffering of the local mill workers and develops a passionate sense of social justice. This is intensified by her tempestuous relationship with the mill-owner and self-made man, John Thornton, as their fierce opposition over his treatment of his employees masks a deeper attraction.<br /><br />In <i>North and South</i>, Elizabeth Gaskell skillfully fuses individual feeling with social concern, and in Margaret Hale creates one of the most original heroines of Victorian literature.",

    "description": "<b>Pulitzer Prize Winner (1998)</b><br /><br />In <i>American Pastoral</i>, Philip Roth gives us a novel of unqualified greatness that is an elegy for all the twentieth century's promises of prosperity, civic order, and domestic bliss. Roth's protagonist is Seymour 'Swede' Levov - a legendary high school athlete, a devoted family man, a hard worker, the prosperous inheritor of his father's Newark glove factory - comes of age in thriving, triumphant post-war America. And then one day in 1968, Swede's beautiful American luck deserts him.<br /><br />For Swede's adored daughter, Merry, has grown from a loving, quick-witted girl into a sullen, fanatical teenager - a teenager capable of an outlandishly savage act of political terrorism. And overnight Swede is wrenched out of the longed-for American pastoral and into the indigenous American berserk. Compulsively readable, propelled by sorrow, rage, and a deep compassion for its characters, this is Roth's masterpiece.",

    "description": "In the summer of '76, the Shulmans and the Melishes migrate to Kaaterskill, the tiny town in upstate New York where Orthodox Jews and Yankee year-rounders live side by side from June through August. <br /><br />Elizabeth Shulman, a devout follower of Rav Elijah Kirshner and the mother of five daughters, is restless. She needs a project of her own, outside her family and her cloistered community. <br /><br />Across the street, Andras Melish is drawn to Kaaterskill by his adoring older sisters, bound to him by their loss and wrenching escape from the Holocaust. Both comforted and crippled by his sisters' love, Andras cannot overcome the ambivalence he feels toward his children and his own beautiful wife. <br /><br />At the top of the hill, Rav Kirshner is coming to the end of his life, and he struggles to decide which of his sons should succeed him: the pious but stolid Isaiah, or the brilliant but worldly Jeremy. <br /><br />Behind the scenes, alarmed as his beloved Kaaterskill is overdeveloped by Michael King, the local real estate broker, Judge Miles Taylor keeps an old secret in check, biding his time....",

    "description": "Originally published in 1854, Walden; or, Life in the Woods, is a vivid account of the time that Henry D. Thoreau lived alone in a secluded cabin at Walden Pond. It is one of the most influential and compelling books in American literature. This new paperback edition-introduced by noted American writer John Updike-celebrates the 150th anniversary of this classic work. Much of Walden's material is derived from Thoreau's journals and contains such engaging pieces as \"Reading\" and \"The Pond in the Winter\" Other famous sections involve Thoreau's visits with a Canadian woodcutter and with an Irish family, a trip to Concord, and a description of his bean field. This is the complete and authoritative text of Walden-as close to Thoreau's original intention as all available evidence allows. For the student and for the general reader, this is the ideal presentation of Thoreau's great document of social criticism and dissent.",

    "description": "Ninety miles north of Seattle on the Washington coast lies Bellingham Bay, where a rough settlement founded in the 1850s would become the town of Whatcom. Here, the Lummi and Nooksack Indian people fish and farm, hermits pay their debts in sockeye salmon, and miners track gold-bearing streams.<br /><br />Here, too, is the intimate, murderous tale of three men. Clare Fishburn believes that greatness lies in store for him. John Ireland Sharp, an educated orphan, abandons hope when he sees socialists expel the Chinese workers from the region. Beal Obenchain, who lives in a cedar stump, threatens Clare Fishburn's life. <br /><br />A killer lashes a Chinese worker to a wharf piling at low tide. Settlers pour in to catch the boom the railroads bring. People give birth, drown, burn, inherit rich legacies, and commit expensive larcenies. All this takes place a hundred years ago, when these vital, ruddy men and women were ''the living.''",

    "description": "<b>The third collection of poetry from the author of\u00a0Lighthead, winner of the 2010 National Book Award</b><br /><br />Terrance Hayes is an elegant and adventurous writer with disarming humor, grace, tenderness, and brilliant turns of phrase. He is very much interested in what it means to be an artist and a black man. In his first collection, <b>Muscular Music</b>, he took the reader through a living library of cultural icons, from Shaft and Fat Albert to John Coltrane and Miles Davis. His second collection, Hip Logic, continued these explorations of popular culture, fatherhood, cultural heritage, and loss. <b>Wind in a Box</b>, Hayes\u2019s resonant new collection, continues his interest in how traditions (of poetry and culture alike) can be simultaneously upended and embraced. The struggle for freedom (the wind) within containment (the box) is the unifying motif as Hayes explores how identity is shaped by race, heritage, and spirituality. This new book displays not only what the <b>Los Angeles Times</b> calls the range of a \"bold virtuoso,\" but also the imaginative fervor of a poet in love with poetry.",

This is the world of young Merlin, the illegitimate child of a South Wales princess who will not reveal to her son his father's true identity. Yet Merlin is an extraordinary child, aware at the earliest age that he possesses a great natural gift - the Sight. Against a background of invasion and imprisonment, wars and conquest, Merlin emerges into manhood, and accepts his dramatic role in the New Beginning - the coming of King Arthur.",

    "description": "In these three narratives, an ingenious story-teller has created a new kind of fantasy, playful yet vaguely sinister, laced with her own brand of humor, which reviewers have labeled variously as \"funky,\" \"mischievous,\" \"weird,\" and \"hilarious.\"<br /><br />The author was in her early thirties when the title story won her country's highest literary award. In <em>The Bridegroom Was a Dog</em>, an offbeat cram school teacher tells her pupils a story about a little princess whose hand in marriage is promised to a dog as a reward for licking her bottom clean; only to have her own life turned upside down by the sudden appearance of a dog-like man with a predilection for the same part of her anatomy. When rumor-mongering housewives try to force them into a more respectable relationship, both escape into new relationships of their own...<br /><br />With its publication here, alongside two other equally offbeat but plausible fantasies, readers in the West can now discover for themselves a writer whose inventions are as strange and exhilarating as the best of dreams.",

In <b>I, Robot</b>, Asimov chronicles the development of the robot through a series of interlinked stories: from its primitive origins in the present to its ultimate perfection in the not-so-distant future--a future in which humanity itself may be rendered obsolete.<br /><br />Here are stories of robots gone mad, of mind-read robots, and robots with a sense of humor. Of robot politicians, and robots who secretly run the world--all told with the dramatic blend of science fact and science fiction that has become Asimov's trademark.",

Columnist Dan Savage has hand-picked over 300 letters from six years worth of \"Savage Love,\" a no-holds-barred syndicated sex-advice column which runs in 16 papers in the United States and Canada, including The Village Voice and the San Francisco Weekly. An original and funny thinker, thrashing around in the playground of human sexuality, Savage advises on a wide range of titillating topics: * What is the best seduction music? * How do I come out to my fundamentalist parents? * What is so wonderful about intercourse, anyway? Forget Anka Radakovich and Isadora Altman. Tune in to Dan Savage as he answers these questions and much more in his own uniquely irreverent and sexually spunky style.",

Imprisoned under Sadat for her opinions, she has continued to fight against all forms of discrimination based on class, gender, nation, race or religion. In In a Daughter of Isis, she painted a portrait of the childhood that moulded her into a novelist and fighter for freedom and the rights of women. This autobiography takes up the story of her extraordinary life.",

    "description": "Once there was a little doll. Her name was Edith. She lived in a nice house and had everything she needed except someone to play with. She was lonely! Then one morning Edith looked into the garden and there stood two bears! Since it was first published in 1957, The Lonely Doll has established itself as a unique children's classic. Through innovative photography Dare Wright brings the world of dolls to life and entertains us with much more than just a story. Edith, the star of the show, is a doll from Wright's childhood, and Wright selected the bear family with the help of her brother. With simple poses and wonderful expressions, the cast of characters is vividly brought to life to tell a story of friendship.",

    "description": "John Okada was born in Seattle, Washington in 1923. He attended the University of Washington and Columbia University. He served in the US Army in World War II, wrote one novel and died of a heart attack at the age of 47. John Okada died in obscurity believing that Asian America had rejected his work. <br /><br />In this work, Okada gives the perspective of a no-no boy, a Japanese-American man who would neither denounce his Japanese heritage nor fight for the U.S. Army during WWII. This novel takes place after the main character spent two years in a Japanese internment camp, and two years in prison after saying no when asked to join the U.S. Army. Okada's novel No-No Boy shows the internal and external struggles fought by Japanese-Americans in that time period, be they no-no boys or not.",

The tragedy of Max's life was to fall in love at seventeen with Alice, a girl his own age - but to her, Max looks like an unappealingly middle-aged man. However when Max reaches the age of thirty-five, with an appearance to match, he has his second chance at love. But tragedy befalls this star-crossed couple, and desperate measures are required.",

    "description": "<em>The Bad Guys Won</em>, award-winning <em>Sports Illustrated</em> baseball writer Jeff Pearlman returns to an innocent time when a city worshipped a man named Mookie and the Yankees were the second-best team in New York.<br /><br />It was 1986, and the New York Mets won 108 regular-season games and the World Series, capturing the hearts (and other assorted body parts) of fans everywhere. But their greatness on the field was nearly eclipsed by how bad they were off it. Led by the indomitable Keith Hernandez and the young dynamic duo of Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry, along with the gallant Scum Bunch, the Amazin\u2019s left a wide trail of wreckage in their wake\u2014hotel rooms, charter planes, a bar in Houston, and most famously Bill Buckner and the hated Boston Red Sox.<br /><br />With an unforgettable cast of characters\u2014including Doc, Straw, the Kid, Nails, Mex, and manager Davey Joshson\u2014this \u201caffectionate but critical look at this exciting season\u201d (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>) celebrates the last of baseball\u2019s arrogant, insane, rock-and-roll-and-party-all-night teams, exploring what could have been, what should have been, and what never was.",

    "description": "When the Emperor Hirohito died in 1989, Japanese newspapers had to use a special, exalted word to refer to his death, and had to depict his life uncritically, as one beginning in turbulence but ending in magnificent accomplishment. To do otherwise would have exposed them to terrorism from the vigilant right wing. Yet this insightful book by a Japanese-American scholar who grew up in both cultures reveals the hidden fault lines in the realm of the dying emperor by telling the stories of three unlikely dissenters: a supermarket owner who burned the national flag; an aging widow who challenged the state's \"deification\" of fallen soldiers; and the mayor of Nagasaki, who risked his career and his life by suggesting that Hirohito bore some responsibility for World War II.",

    "description": "Some seven million people board the New York City subway every day, each one with a story to tell. <b>The Subway Chronicles</b> collects twenty-seven of the tales, dramas and comedies that unfold during the daily commute. From the \u201cmole people\u201d living in the subway tunnels, to the transit employees working behind the scenes, to the locals and tourists riding shoulder-to-shoulder in harmony, discord, or indifference, <b>The Subway Chronicles</b> offers a kaleidoscope of perspectives on this most public of spaces.Prominent New York writers weigh in:<br /><br /><br />Jonathan Lethem confesses his childhood subway sins<br /><br /><br />Colson Whitehead offers mass-transit tips for newcomers to the city<br /><br /><br />Francine Prose recalls the thrill and apprehension of riding alone as a teenage girl<br /><br /><br />Calvin Trillin pokes fun at the classic New York tendency to be skeptical about everything<br /><br /><br />Stan Fischler delights in memories of riding the open-air train cars to Coney Island as a boy<br /><br /><br />Equal parts hilarious, poignant, and heartbreaking, <b>The Subway Chronicles</b> is a journey into New York\u2019s underground with some of today\u2019s most loved writers.",

    "description": "Golan Trevize, former Councilman of the First Foundation, has chosen the future, and it is Gaia. A superorganism, Gaia is a holistic planet with a common consciousness so intensely united that every dewdrop, every pebble, every being, can speak for all\u2014and feel for all. It is a realm in which privacy is not only undesirable, it is incomprehensible. <br /><br />But is it the right choice for the destiny of mankind? While Trevize feels it is, that is not enough. He must know. <br /><br />Trevize believes the answer lies at the site of humanity's roots: fabled Earth . . . if it still exists. For no one is sure where the planet of Gaia's first settlers is to be found in the immense wilderness of the Galaxy. Nor can anyone explain why no record of Earth has been preserved, no mention of it made anywhere in Gaia's vast world-memory. It is an enigma Trevize is determined to resolve, and a quest he is determined to undertake, at any cost.<br /><br />[ Original description here: <br />\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0443 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 - \u0417\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0443 \u0442\u0430\u0439\u043d \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0413\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438. <br />= A handful of brave souls trying to find humanity's ancestral home\u2014the Earth, to get answers to the mysteries of the history of the Galaxy.]",

    "description": "<i>\"WHAT'S THE USE OF ELABORATING</i> what, in its very essence, is so short-lived as a modern book? Though I wrote the Gospels in this century, I should die in the gutter.\" --Herman Melville, in a letter to Nathaniel Hawthorne, 1851<br /><br /><i>ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS HAVE</i> passed since Herman Melville wrote his masterpiece. Yet <i>Moby-Dick</i> endures as an indisputable literary classic that continues to speak to readers today. Join Captain Ahab, an eerily compelling madman, as he pursues an unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. In his monomaniacal quest, Ahab focuses his distilled hatred and suffering--and that of generations before him--against one single creature, and pursues it relentlessly.<br /><br />More than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopedia of whaling lore and legend, this is a haunting, mesmerizing, and important social commentary populated with several of the most unforgettable and enduring characters in literature. Written with wonderfully redemptive humor, <i>Moby-Dick</i> is a profound and timeless inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception.",

    "description": "Paul Iverson's life changes in an instant. He returns home one day to find that his wife, Lexy, has died under strange circumstances. The only witness was their dog, Lorelei, whose anguished barking brought help to the scene - but too late. In the days and weeks that follow, Paul begins to notice strange \"clues\" in their home: books rearranged on their shelves, a mysterious phone call, and other suggestions that nothing about Lexy's last afternoon was quite what it seemed. Reeling from grief, Paul is determined to decipher this evidence and unlock the mystery of her death. But he can't do it alone; he needs Lorelei's help. A linguist by training, Paul embarks on an impossible endeavor: a series of experiments designed to teach Lorelei to communicate what she knows. Perhaps behind her wise and earnest eyes lies the key to what really happened to the woman he loved. As Paul's investigation leads him in unexpected and even perilous directions, he revisits the pivotal moments of his life with Lexy, the brilliant, enigmatic woman whose sparkling passion for life and dark, troubled past he embraced equally.",

    "description": "President Ulysses S. Grant (1822-1885) was one of the most esteemed individuals of the nineteenth century. His two-volume memoirs, sold door-to-door by former Union soldiers, have never gone out of print and were once as ubiquitous in American households as the Bible. Mark Twain, Gertrude Stein, Matthew Arnold, Henry James, and Edmund Wilson hailed these works as great literature, and Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush both credit Grant with influencing their own writing. Yet a judiciously annotated clarifying edition of these memoirs has never been produced until now.<br /><br /><i>The Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant</i> is the first comprehensively annotated edition of Grant's memoirs, fully representing the great military leader's thoughts on his life and times through the end of the Civil War and his invaluable perspective on battlefield decision making. An introduction contextualizes Grant's life and significance, and lucid editorial commentary allows the president's voice and narrative to shine through. With annotations compiled by the editors of the Ulysses S. Grant Association's Presidential Library, this definitive edition enriches our understanding of the antebellum era, the Mexican War, and the Civil War. Grant provides insight into how rigorously these events tested America's democratic institutions and the cohesion of its social order.<br /><br /><i>The Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant</i> preserves and extends a work of profound political, historical, and literary significance and serves as the gateway for modern readers of all backgrounds to an American classic.",

Family and friends feel naked and exposed by the truths they have seen in his book, and their fury drives him from his home. He begins a search for his own identity that takes him to New York and a hectic social whirl; to Paris with an uninhibited group of expatriates; to Berlin, lying cold and sinister under Hitler's shadow. At last Webber returns to America and rediscovers it with love, sorrow, and hope.",

    "description": "How to place the mysterious Swiss writer Robert Walser, a humble genius who possessed one of the most elusive and surprising sensibilities in modern literature? Walser is many things: a Paul Klee in words, maker of droll, whimsical, tender, and heartbreaking verbal artifacts; an inspiration to such very different writers as Kafka and W.G. Sebald; an amalgam, as Susan Sontag suggests in her preface to this volume, of Stevie Smith and Samuel Beckett.<br /><br />This collection gathers forty-two of Walser's stories. Encompassing everything from journal entries, notes on literature, and biographical sketches to anecdotes, fables, and visions, it is an ideal introduction to this fascinating writer of whom Hermann Hesse famously declared, \"If he had a hundred thousand readers, the world would be a better place.\"<br /><br />Response to a Request<br />Flower Days<br />Trousers<br />Two Strange Stories<br />Balloon Journey<br />Kleist in Thum<br />The Job Application<br />The Boat<br />A Little Ramble<br />Helbling's Story<br />The Little Berliner<br />Nervous<br />The Walk<br />So! \"I've Got You\"<br />Nothing at All<br />Kienast<br />Poests<br />Frau Wilke<br />The Street<br />Snowdrops<br />Winter<br />The She-Owl<br />Knocking<br />Titus<br />Vladimir<br />Parisian Newspapers<br />The Monkey<br />Dostoevsky's Idiot<br />Am I Dreaming?<br />The Little Tree<br />Stork and Porcupine<br />A Contribution to the Celebration of Conrad Ferdinand Meyer<br />A Sort of Speech<br />A Letter to Therese Breitbach<br />A Village Tale<br />The Aviator<br />The Pimp<br />Masters and Workers<br />Essay on Freedom<br />A Biedermeier Story<br />The Honeymoon<br />Thoughts on Cezanne",

Part memoir, part lies, this is a story about loving a woman made of paper.",

    "description": "'Nothing That Meets the Eye' confirms Patricia Highsmith as a great American writer.<br /><br />If only Patricia Highsmith (1921-1995) had been alive to see the thunderous critical response to the publication of the best-selling 'The Selected Stories of Patricia Highsmith' in 2001. Now the Highsmith renaissance continues with this brilliant collection of 28 short stories, a great majority of which have never been seen before. The stories assembled in 'Nothing That Meets the Eye', written between 1938 and 1982, are vintage Highsmith: a gigolo-like psychopath preys on unfulfilled career women; a lonely spinster's fragile hold on reality is tethered to the bottle; an estranged postal worker invents homicidal fantasies about his coworkers. <br /><br />While some stories anticipate the diabolical narratives of the Ripley novels, others possess a Capra-like sweetness that forces us to see the author in a new light. From this new collection, a remarkable portrait of the American psyche at mid-century emerges, unforgettably distilled by the inimitable eye of Patricia Highsmith. <br /><br />Patricia Highsmith is the author of such classics as 'Strangers on a Train' and 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'. Born in Fort Worth, Texas, she died in 1995 in Locarno, Switzerland.",

    "description": "<b>Revised, with a new cover</b><br /><br />When <i>Edie</i> was first published, it quickly became an international best-seller and then took its place among the classic books about the 1960s. Edie Sedgwick exploded into the public eye like a comet. She seemed to have it all: she was aristocratic and glamorous, vivacious and young, Andy Warhol\u2019s superstar. But within a few years she flared out as quickly as she had appeared, and before she turned twenty-nine she was dead from a drug overdose.<br /><br />In a dazzling tapestry of voices\u2014family, friends, lovers, rivals\u2014the entire meteoric trajectory of Edie Sedgwick\u2019s life is brilliantly captured. And so is the Pop Art world of the \u201860s: the sex, drugs, fashion, music\u2014the mad rush for pleasure and fame. All glitter and flash on the outside, it was hollow and desperate within\u2014like Edie herself, and like her mentor, Andy Warhol. Alternately mesmerizing, tragic, and horrifying, this book shattered many myths about the \u201860s experience in America.<br />",

In short, The Death of Common Sense demonstrates how the buck never stops and how ell-meaning laws are creating a nation of enemies. (Poltics/Current Events)",

Splitting time between a ramshackle apartment and a lonely hot dog vendor, the observant thirteen-year-old who stands steadily at the center of <i>Here They Come</i> gives lyrical voice to an unforgettable instant \u20141970s New York, stifling, violent and full of life. Balanced between her enigmatic siblings, detached parents, and a quiet sense of the surreal, she recounts a year of startling moments with dark humor and deadpan resilience.",

    "description": "This novel is a meticulously detailed account of a celebrated murder trial. It concentrates on defense attorney Paul Biegler from the moment he accepts the case until the verdict is brought in. Biegler's client is accused of murdering a man who his wife claims assaulted her. The book leaves us wondering about the guilt and its locus -- in this case, does it belong to the dead man, to the accused or to his wife?",

His poems chart a course through his own highly original American dreamscape in language that is fresh, accessible, and remarkably precise. This debut collection has received extraordinary acclaim from readers and reviewers alike and is quickly becoming a cult classic. As Pulitzer Prize-winning poet James Tate said, \"These poems are beautiful, strange, intelligent, and funny. . . . It's a book for everyone.\"",

    "description": "'I always wanted to be historical,' Gertrude Stein once quipped. In 1932, Stein began writing the 'autobiography' of her longtime friend and companion, Alice B. Toklas. The book, an immediate bestseller, guaranteed them both a place in history. An account of their life together in Paris before, during, and after World War I, it is full of the atmosphere of the changing life of the city and of idiosyncratic glimpses of such figures as Matisse, Picasso, Braque, Cocteau, Apollinaire, Pound, Eliot, Hemingway, and other luminaries and aspirants who were their close friends. But at the center of the narrative there is always the titanic figure of Gertrude Stein, the self-proclaimed 'first-class genius' who some dismissed as the 'Mother Goose of Montparnasse,' presiding over her celebrated residence-salon-art gallery at 27, rue de Fleurus. William Troy remarked about her: 'It is not flippant to say that if she had not come to exist . . . it would be necessary to invent Miss Gertrude Stein.'",

    "description": "Fernando Pessoa was many writers in one. He attributed his prolific writings to a wide range of alternate selves, each of which had a distinct biography, ideology. and horoscope. When he died in 1935, Pessoa left behind a trunk filled with unfinished and unpublished writings, among which were the remarkable pages that make up his posthumous masterpiece, <b>The Book of Disquiet</b>, an astonishing work that, in George Steiner's words, \"gives to Lisbon the haunting spell of Joyce's Dublin or Kafka's Prague.\"Published for the first time some fifty years after his death, this unique collection of short, aphoristic paragraphs comprises the \"autobiography\" of Bernardo Soares, one of Pessoa's alternate selves. Part intimate diary, part prose poetry, part descriptive narrative, captivatingly translated by Richard Zenith, <b>The Book of Disquiet</b> is one of the greatest works of the twentieth century.<br />",

    "description": "Widow Charity Selbornehad been greatly looking forward to her driving holiday through France with her old friend Louise - long, leisurely days under the hot sun, enjoying the beauty of the parched Provencal landscape. But when Charity arrived at a plush resort in the picturesque French resort town of Avignon, she had no way of knowing that she was to become the principal player in the last act of a strange and brutal tragedy. Most of it had already been played. There had been love--and lust--and revenge and fear and murder.<br /><br />Very soon her dreams turn into a nightmare, when by befriending a terrified boy and catching the attention of his enigmatic, possibly murderous father, Charity has inadvertently placed herself center stage. She becomes enmeshed in the schemes of a gang of murderers, one of them a man with whom she is rapidly falling in love... And now the killer, with blood enough on his hands, is waiting in the wings.",

The Illuminati has surfaced from the shadows to carry out the final phase of its legendary vendetta against its most hated enemy... the Catholic Church. <br /><br />Langdon's worst fears are confirmed on the eve of the Vatican's holy conclave, when a messenger of the Illuminati announces he has hidden an unstoppable time bomb at the very heart of Vatican City. With the countdown under way, Langdon jets to Rome to join forces with Vittoria Vetra, a beautiful and mysterious Italian scientist, to assist the Vatican in a desperate bid for survival. <br /><br />Embarking on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and even to the heart of the most secretive vault on earth, Langdon and Vetra follow a 400-year old trail of ancient symbols that snakes across Rome toward the long-forgotten Illuminati lair... a secret location that contains the only hope for Vatican salvation. <br /><br />An explosive international thriller, Angels &amp; Demons careens from enlightening epiphanies to dark truths as the battle between science and religion turns to war.",

    "description": "First U.S. Publication<br /><br />A major literary event--the complete, uncensored journals of Sylvia Plath, published in their entirety for the first time.<br /><br />Sylvia Plath's journals were originally published in 1982 in a heavily abridged version authorized by Plath's husband, Ted Hughes. This new edition is an exact and complete transcription of the diaries Plath kept during the last twelve years of her life. Sixty percent of the book is material that has never before been made public, more fully revealing the intensity of the poet's personal and literary struggles, and providing fresh insight into both her frequent desperation and the bravery with which she faced down her demons. The complete Journals of Sylvia Plath is essential reading for all who have been moved and fascinated by Plath's life and work.",

    "description": "The failure of the marriage between Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes has always been considered from one of two conflicting viewpoints: hers or his. Missing for more than four decades has been a third perspective on the events that brought their marriage to its ill-fated end, the story of another\u2014the other\u2014woman: Hughes' mistress Assia Wevill. Like Plath before her, Assia shared her life with Hughes for seven years, until she took her own life and that of their daughter at the age of forty-two, in a manner that nearly replicated Plath's suicide six years earlier. Drawing on previously unavailable documents and private papers, including Assia's diaries and her intimate correspondence with Hughes, this book shows the vital influence Assia exerted on the poet and his work, and the uneasy life they shared under the long shadow of Plath. A Lover of Unreason is the first-ever full-length biography of Assia Wevill. It casts a keen light, and explores the emergence of a singular twentieth-century woman. Three-times divorc\u00e9e, career woman, mistress, and single mother, Assia Wevill openly defied the conventions of a censorious pre-feminist Britain and mesmerized men and women alike with her quick-mind and exotic beauty.",

    "description": "In what is arguably his greatest work, America's most heroically ambitious writer follows the short, blighted career of Gary Gilmore, an intractably violent product of America's prisons who became notorious for two reasons: first, for robbing two men in 1976, then killing them in cold blood; and, second, after being tried and convicted, for insisting on dying for his crime. To do so, he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death.<p>Norman Mailer tells Gilmore's story--and those of the men and women caught up in his procession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. <b>The Executioner's Song</b> is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest sources of American loneliness and violence. It is a towering achievement--impossible to put down, impossible to forget.<br /><br />Winner of the 1980 Pulitzer Prize</p>",

Now he's suddenly struck by an incredible power--the ability to see multiple potential futures.<br /><br />Still reeling from this inexplicable gift, Seth stumbles upon a beautiful woman named Miriam. Unknown to Seth, Miriam is a Saudi Arabian princess who has fled her veiled existence to escape a forced marriage of unimaginable consequences. Cultures collide as they're thrown together and forced to run from an unstoppable force determined to kidnap or kill Miriam.<br /><br />Seth's mysterious ability helps them avoid capture once, then twice. But with no sleep, a fugitive princess by his side, hit men a heartbeat away, and a massive manhunt steadily closing in, evasion becomes impossible.<br /><br />An intoxicating tale set amidst the shifting sands of the Middle East and the back roads of America, <i>Blink</i> engages issues as ancient as the earth itself...and as current as today's headlines.",

He saw his own hoofprints left in the sodden earth when he\u2019d galloped through the battle in the form of a horse. And he saw the woman who\u2019d ridden him, slashing destruction with a flaming sword\u2026\u00a0 </i><br /> \u00a0<br /> Blair Murphy has always worked alone. Destined to be a demon hunter in a world that doesn\u2019t believe in such things, she lives for the kill. But now, she finds herself the warrior in a circle of six, chosen by the goddess Morrigan to defeat the vampire Lilith and her minions. <br /> \u00a0<br /> Learning to trust the others has been hard, for Blair has never allowed herself such a luxury. But she finds herself drawn to Larkin, a man of many shapes. As a horse, he is proud and graceful; as a dragon, beautifully fierce; and as a man\u2026well, Blair has never seen one quite so ruggedly handsome and playfully charming as this nobleman from the past.<br /> \u00a0<br /> In two months\u2019 time, the circle of six will face Lilith and her army in Geall. To complete preparations and round up forces to fight, the circle travels through time to Larkin\u2019s world, where Blair must choose between battling her overwhelming attraction to him\u2014or risking everything for a love that can never be\u2026",

But there is one vampire who dares stand against her. And his love for the scholarly queen of Geall will complete the circle of six - and change the face of eternity.</i><br /><br />Having traveled through the Dance of the Gods to the land of Geall, the circle finds themselves convincing then training the people of Geall to defeat Lilith\u2019s vampire army. The Valley of Silence is a forbidding place for the battle of all battles, but the circle continues to prepare through magic and a few early stakeouts that test their strength individually and as a team.<br /><br />Moira finds herself playing the roles of warrior and royal, as she follows the tradition of her people and prepares to take the crown before leading them into battle. And if that isn\u2019t enough, she finds her thoughts turning to Cian more often than not.<br /><br />So what\u2019s a chaste and intelligent young woman to do when given less than a month with the man she loves, who\u2019s not a man, but a vampire? And how will the people of Geall fare against an army of blood-thirsty vampires who have had centuries to prepare?",

    "description": "Number-one <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Nora Roberts delivers an extraordinary new trilogy\u2014an epic tale that breaks down the boundaries between reality and the otherworldly, while forging together the passions of the men and women caught in a battle for the fate of humanity ...<br /><br />In the last days of high summer, with lightning striking blue in a black sky, the sorcerer stood on a high cliff overlooking the raging sea...<br /><br />Belting out his grief into the storm, Hoyt Mac Cionaoith rails against the evil that has torn his twin brother from their family's embrace. Her name is Lilith. Existing for over a thousand years, she has lured countless men to an immortal doom with her soul-stealing kiss. But now, this woman known as vampire will stop at nothing until she rules this world\u2014and those beyond it...<br /><br />Hoyt is no match for the dark siren. But his powers come from the goddess Morrigan, and it is through her that he will get his chance at vengeance. At Morrigan's charge, he must gather five others to form a ring of power strong enough to overcome Lilith. A circle of six: himself, the witch, the warrior, the scholar, the one of many forms and the one he's lost. And it is in this circle, hundreds of years in the future, where Hoyt will learn how strong his spirit\u2014and his heart\u2014have become...<br /><br /><i>Note: This edition includes a \"Glossary of Irish Words, Characters and Places\" immediately after the story concludes.</i>",

But the very night she returns to Richmond, she deactivates her burglar alarm and opens her door to someone who nearly decapitates her. Why did she let him in, wonders Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta? And, why is Beryl's latest manuscript missing? Persuing the answers involves Scarpetta in the murder of another writer - Beryl's jealous mentor. While she copes with a variety of personal and professional problems, Scarpetta's high-tech forensic skills enable her to collect a body of evidence - clues that would mean little without her intelligence, compassion, and imagination - that leads her directly into a nightmare all her own.",

    "description": "<b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER - The instant classic about why some ideas thrive, why others die, and how to improve your idea's chances--essential reading in the \"fake news\" era.</b><br /><br />Mark Twain once observed, \"A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on.\" His observation rings true: Urban legends, conspiracy theories, and bogus news stories circulate effortlessly. Meanwhile, people with important ideas--entrepreneurs, teachers, politicians, and journalists--struggle to make them \"stick.\"<br /><br />In <i>Made to Stick</i>, Chip and Dan Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the human scale principle, using the Velcro Theory of Memory, and creating curiosity gaps. Along the way, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds--from the infamous \"kidney theft ring\" hoax to a coach's lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony--draw their power from the same six traits.<br /><br /><i>Made to Stick</i> will transform the way you communicate. It's a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures): the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of the Mother Teresa Effect; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice.<br /><br />Provocative, eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, <i>Made to Stick</i> shows us the vital principles of winning ideas--and tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.",

    "description": "A riveting memoir of a girl's painful coming-of-age in a wealthy Chinese family during the 1940s.<br /><br />A Chinese proverb says, \"Falling leaves return to their roots.\" In Chinese Cinderella, Adeline Yen Mah returns to her roots to tell the story of her painful childhood and her ultimate triumph and courage in the face of despair. Adeline's affluent, powerful family considers her bad luck after her mother dies giving birth to her. Life does not get any easier when her father remarries. She and her siblings are subjected to the disdain of her stepmother, while her stepbrother and stepsister are spoiled. Although Adeline wins prizes at school, they are not enough to compensate for what she really yearns for -- the love and understanding of her family.<br /><br />Following the success of the critically acclaimed adult bestseller Falling Leaves, this memoir is a moving telling of the classic Cinderella story, with Adeline Yen Mah providing her own courageous voice.",

John Ortberg calls readers back to the dynamic heartbeat of Christianity\u2014God\u2019s power to bring change and growth\u2014and reveals both the how and why of transformation. With a new chapter on prayer and added discussion questions, this expanded edition of The Life You\u2019ve Always Wanted offers modern perspectives on the ancient path of the spiritual disciplines. But this is more than just a book about things to do to be a good Christian. It\u2019s a road map toward true transformation that starts not with the individual but with the object of the journey\u2014Jesus Christ. As with a marathon runner, the secret to winning the race lies not in trying harder, but in training consistently\u2014training with the spiritual disciplines. The disciplines are neither taskmasters nor an end in themselves. Rather they are exercises that build strength and endurance for the road of growth. The fruit of the Spirit\u2014joy, peace, kindness, etc.\u2014are the signposts along the way. Paved with humor and sparkling anecdotes, The Life You\u2019ve Always Wanted is an encouraging and challenging approach to a Christian life that\u2019s worth living\u2014a life on the edge that fills an ordinary world with new meaning, hope, change, and joy.",

    "description": "In her latest thriller, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Tami Hoag takes readers on a suspense-filled ride of shocks and twists leading to an explosive finish. It is the story of an ex-cop, a missing girl, and a killer locked in a race where there can be only one winner\u2014and the losers die trying. <br /><br />In a trailer in a Florida swamp, time is running out for eighteen year-old Erin Seabright. A pawn in a kidnapper's terrifying game for a ransom no one can pay, her last hope is a washed-up ex-cop who has already lost it all-not once, but twice.<br /><br />The wealthy world of the Palm Beach horse set seems a long way from a cop's world in the narcotics division. A lifetime ago, undercover sheriff's detective Elena Estes worked the mean streets and BackTop alleys, living by her wits and playing the long odds until she took one risk too many. Now Estes lives on the ragged edge of lost hope and self-hatred, hiding from the past and believing she doesn't deserve to have a future. But the past is about to come back with a vengeance, and the future is about to become a race between life and death.<br /><br />A young woman is missing and her twelve year-old stepsister comes to Estes for help. No one but serious, studious Molly Seabright seems concerned about what's happened to her troubled older sister. But Molly is convinced Erin is in danger. Estes has no P.I. license, no interest in a new career, and no desire to break her self-imposed exile. But the more she learns about the people Erin Seabright was involved with, the more her long-dormant cop instincts come back to life.<br /><br />One trip to the show grounds where Erin worked as a groom, and Estes is quickly pulled to the dark side of a glamorous sport. Behind the glittering, ultra-rich facade is an ultra-ruthless world of drugs, payoffs, and dirty deals. A world of dissolute playboys and crooked horse-dealers, of royalty and rabble, of rivals and enemies. An obscenely wealthy world where anything can be had for a price\u2014including a life.<br /><br />And in that world stalks a killer who will lead Estes down a dark, twisted trail of decadence and deceit, mayhem and murder\u2014from the gilded life of Palm Beach to the darkest corners of the Florida swamps, to a final show-down that could cost her everything. A race against time and evil. A race in which Estes is the dark horse\u2014and no one is betting on her to win.",

    "description": "David, unlike any Bible character before him, had the charisma to inspire a great nation. Yet in other ways he was a most ordinary man-often gripped by destructive passion, rocked by personal tragedy, and motivated by political gain. Yet, he is the one character the Bible describes as a \"man after God's own heart.\" In this first volume of the \"Great Lives\" series Charles Swindoll shows how David proved his love for God many times over in an extraordinary life that left an enduring legacy of faith.",

It is a thought-provoking study of God's invisible hand, writing silently across the pages of human history. Perhaps most of all, it is an account of a godly woman with the courage, wisdom, and strength to block an evil plot, overthrow an arrogant killer, and replace with joy in thousands of Jewish homes. Through Esther's courageous struggle to help her people, Swindoll explains the power of divine providence in volume 2 of the best-selling \"Great Lives\" series.",

    "description": "Unfortunately, Roy's first acquaintance in Florida is Dana Matherson, a well-known bully. Then again, if Dana hadn't been sinking his thumbs into Roy's temples and mashing his face against the school-bus window, Roy might never have spotted the running boy. And the running boy is intriguing: he was running away from the school bus, carried no books, and-here's the odd part-wore no shoes. Sensing a mystery, Roy sets himself on the boy's trail. The chase introduces him to potty-trained alligators, a fake-fart champion, some burrowing owls, a renegade eco-avenger, and several extremely poisonous snakes with unnaturally sparkling tails.<br />Roy has most definitely arrived in Carl Hiaasen's Florida. \"From the Hardcover edition.\"",

    "description": "In a world where faith is fading and integrity is rare, the life of Joseph shines like a brilliant star in the nighttime sky, showing us that following God brings hope even in the worst of circumstances. In \"Joseph\", Chuck Swindoll reveals a man buffeted with the same kinds of problems we face today--or worse. A man whose tenacious faith in God ultimately won him great honor and achievement.<br />No family today is more dysfunctional than Joseph's. No one faces greater temptation than Potiphar's wife offered this man of faith. No faith is challenged more than Joseph's as he sat on death row in an Egyptian prison. Yet Joseph stood firm, modeling for us what is possible when ordinary people maintain their connections with God. <br />Swindoll traces the life of this intriguing man from the famous multi-colored coat, through the jealous rage that prompts his brothers to sell him into slavery, to his astounding rise to a position of national power. He follows Joseph through temptation and imprisonment to his ascension in Egyption society when he explains the king's dream, revealing a grim and threatening future and proposing a plan for saving the nation ... and the brothers who deceived him.<br />Joseph's story reads like an epic novel, filled with intrigue, tension, temptation, and torrential emotions. And it heartens us today because we face the same kinds of difficulties, and he shows us we can triumph.",

    "description": "3 Compact Discs / 3 hours<br /><br />When Jack Reacher suddenly decides to ask a Greyhound bus driver to let him off near the town of Margrave, Georgia, he thinks it's because his brother once mentioned that the famed blues guitarist Blind Blake died there. But it doesn't take long for the footloose ex-military policeman to discover that there are plenty of strange--and very dangerous--things going on behind Margrave's manicured lawns and clean streets that demand his attention. This first thriller by a former television writer features some of the best-written scenes of action in recent memory, a crash course in currency and counterfeiting, and a hero who is just begging to be called on for an encore.",

    "description": "Bestselling author Eric Schlosser takes what he learnt and documented in his popular book, Fast Food Nation, and presents it to preteens and adolescents - the fast food industry's biggest market.<br /><br />Kids love fast food. And the fast food industry definitely loves kids. It couldn\u2019t survive without them. Did you know that the biggest toy company in the world is McDonald\u2019s? It\u2019s true. In fact, one out of every three toys given to a child in the United States each year is from a fast food restaurant. <br /><br />Not only has fast food reached into the toy industry, it\u2019s moving into our schools. One out of every five public schools in the United States now serves brand name fast food. But do kids know what they\u2019re eating? Where do fast food hamburgers come from? And what makes those fries taste so good? <br /><br />When Eric Schlosser\u2019s best-selling book, Fast Food Nation, was published for adults in 2001, many called for his groundbreaking insight to be shared with young people. Now Schlosser, along with co-writer Charles Wilson, has investigated the subject further, uncovering new facts children need to know.<br /><br />In Chew On This, they share with kids the fascinating and sometimes frightening truth about what lurks between those sesame seed buns, what a chicken \u2018nugget\u2019 really is, and how the fast food industry has been feeding off children for generations.",

    "description": "Buddenbrooks, first published in Germany in 1901, when Mann was only twenty-six, has become a classic of modern literature.<br /><br />It is the story of four generations of a wealthy bourgeois family in northern Germany facing the advent of modernity; in an uncertain new world, the family\u2019s bonds and traditions begin to disintegrate. As Mann charts the Buddenbrooks\u2019 decline from prosperity to bankruptcy, from moral and psychic soundness to sickly piety, artistic decadence, and madness, he ushers the reader into a world of stunning vitality, pieced together from births and funerals, weddings and divorces, recipes, gossip, and earthy humor.<br /><br />In its immensity of scope, richness of detail, and fullness of humanity, buddenbrooks surpasses all other modern family chronicles. With remarkable fidelity to the original German text, this superb translation emphasizes the magnificent scale of Mann\u2019s achievement in this riveting, tragic novel.",

    "description": "<b>Bestselling author Lisa Kleypas creates a beguiling story, set in a world where appearance means everything, passion simmers just below the surface, and a respectable Englishwoman is willing to risk scandal for one night of love.</b><br /><br />She was unmarried, untouched and almost thirty, but novelist Amanda Briars wasn't about to greet her next birthday without making love to a man. When he appeared at her door, she believed he was her gift to herself, hired for one night of passion. Unforgettably handsome, irresistibly virile, he tempted her in ways she never thought possible, but something stopped him from completely fulfilling her dream.<br /><br />Jack Devlin's determination to possess Amanda became greater when she discovered his true identity. But gently bred Amanda craved respectability more than she admitted, while Jack, the cast-off son of a nobleman and London's most notorious businessman, refused to live by society's rules. Yet when fate conspired for them to marry, their worlds collided with a passionate force neither had expected... but both soon craved.",

Rilla, almost fifteen, can't think any further ahead than going to her very first dance at the Four Winds lighthouse and getting her first kiss from handsome Kenneth Ford. But undreamed-of challenges await the irrepressible Rilla when the world of Ingleside becomes endangered by a far-off war. Her brothers go off to fight, and Rilla brings home an orphaned newborn in a soup tureen. She is swept into a drama that tests her courage and leaves her changed forever.",

He's sent to the Clarissa Frayne Institute for Parentally Challenged Boys, Freight class. At Clarissa Frayne, the boys are put to work by the state, testing highly dangerous products. At the end of most days, they are covered with burns, bruises, and sores. Cosmo realizes that if he doesn't escape, he will die at this so-called orphanage. When the moment finally comes, Cosmo seizes his chance and breaks out with the help of the Supernaturalists, a motley crew of kids who all have the same special ability as Cosmo-they can see supernatural Parasites, creatures that feed on the life force of humans. The Supernaturalists patrol the city at night, hunting the Parasites in hopes of saving what's left of humanity in Satellite City. Or so they think. The Supernaturalist soon find themselves caught in a web far more complicated than they'd imagined, when they discover a horrifying secret that will force them to question everything they believe in. Eoin Colfer has created an eerie and captivating world-part Blade Runner, part futuristic Dickens-replete with non-stop action",

    "description": "J R is the long-awaited novel from William Gaddis, author of <i>The Recognitions,</i> that tremendous book which, in the twenty years since its publication, has come to be acknowledged as an American masterpiece. And <i>J R</i> is a book of comparable magnitude, substance, and humor--a rushing, raucous look at money and its influence, at love and its absence, at success and its failures, in the magnificently orchestrated circus of all its larger- and smaller-than-life characters; a frantic, forlorn comedy about who uses -- and misuses -- whom.<br /><br />At the center: J R, ambitious sixth-grader in torn sneakers, bred on the challenge of \"free enterprise\" and fired by heady mail-order promises of \"success.\" His teachers would rather be elsewhere, his principal doubles as a bank president, his Long Island classroom mirrors the world he sees around him -- a world of public relations and private betrayals where everything (and everyone) wears a price tag, a world of \"deals\" where honesty is no substitute for experience, and the letter of the law flouts its spirit at every turn. Operating from the remote anonymity of phone booths and the local post office, with beachheads in a seedy New York cafeteria and a catastrophic, carton-crammed tenement on East 96th Street, J R parlays a deal for thousands of surplus Navy picnic forks through penny stock flyers and a distant textile-mill bankruptcy into a nationwide, hydra-headed \"family of companies.\"<br /><br />The J R Corp and its Boss engulf brokers, lawyers, Congressmen, disaffected school teachers and disenfranchised Indians, drunks, divorc\u00e9es, second-hand generals, and a fledgling composer hopelessly entangled in a nightmare marriage of business and the arts. Their bullish ventures -- shaky mineral claims and gas leases, cost-plus defense contracts, a string of nursing homes <i>cum</i> funeral parlors, a formula for frozen music -- burgeon into a paper empire ranging from timber to textiles, from matchbooks to (legalized) marijuana, from prostheses to publishing, inadvertently crushing hopes, careers, an entire town, on a collision course with the bigger world . . . the pragmatic Real World where the business of America <i>is</i> business, where the stock market exists as a convenience, and the tax laws make some people more equal than others . . . the world that makes the rules because it plays to win, and plays for keeps.<br /><br />Absurdly logical, mercilessly real, gathering its own tumultuous momentum for the ultimate brush with commodity trading when the drop in pork belly futures masks the crumbling of our own, <i>J R</i> captures the reader in the cacophony of voices that revolves around this young captive of his own myths -- voices that dominate the book, talking to each other, at each other, into phones, on intercoms, from TV screens and radios -- a vast mosaic of sound that sweeps the reader into the relentless \"real time\" of spoken words in a way unprecedented in modern fiction. The disturbing clarity with which this finished writer captures the ways in which we deal, dissemble, stumble through our words -- through our lives -- while the real plans are being made elsewhere makes <i>J R</i> the extraordinary novel that it is.<br /><br /><i>--From the first-edition dustjacket</i>",

    "description": "Originally published in 1976, Christopher and His Kind covers the most memorable ten years in the writer's life-from 1929, when Isherwood left England to spend a week in Berlin and decided to stay there indefinitely, to 1939, when he arrived in America. His friends and colleagues during this time included W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender, and E. M. Forster, as well as colorful figures he met in Germany and later fictionalized in his two Berlin novels-who appeared again, fictionalized to an even greater degree, in I Am a Camera and Cabaret. <p>What most impressed the first readers of this memoir, however, was the candor with which he describes his life in gay Berlin of the 1930s and his struggles to save his companion, a German man named Heinz, from the Nazis. An engrossing and dramatic story and a fascinating glimpse into a little-known world, Christopher and His Kind remains one of Isherwood's greatest achievements. </p><p>A major figure in twentieth-century fiction and the gay rights movement, Christopher Isherwood (1904-1986) is the author of Down There on a Visit, Lions and Shadows, A Meeting by the River, The Memorial, Prater Violet, A Single Man, and The World in the Evening, all available from the University of Minnesota Press.</p>",

    "description": "<b>'There has been no more terribly acute critic of America than this steel-conscious and death-conscious Spaniard, with his curious passion for the modernities of nickel and tinfoil and nitre . . .' </b>So wrote Conrad Aiken of Lorca's violent response to the New York he encountered as a student at Columbia University in 1929 and 1930. Born and brought up in Andalusia, Lorca's reaction to the brutality and loneliness of the vast city was one of amazement and indignation. His poetry moved away from the lyricism of the early Romanceros and became a vehicle for experimental techniques through which he expressed tortured feelings of alienation and dislocation. Based on a new edition of the original text, Greg Simon's and Steven White's new translation brings to life Lorca's arresting imagery. Christopher Maurer, a leading authority on Lorca's work, provides an enlightening introduction placing Poet in New York in context, and there are translations of Lorca's letters as well as a lecture he gave about the work. Illustrated with archive photographs, this comprehensive volume will make Lorca's masterpiece available to a whole new generation of readers.",

    "description": "\"The following description is for the second edition of <i>About Face</i>. The 3rd Edtion, <i>About Face 3</i> (ISBN 0470084111), is now available.\" First published seven years ago-just before the World Wide Web exploded into dominance in the software world-About Face rapidly became a bestseller. While the ideas and principles in the original book remain as relevant as ever, the examples in About Face 2.0 are updated to reflect the evolution of the Web.<br /><br /> Interaction Design professionals are constantly seeking to ensure that software and software-enabled products are developed with the end-user's goals in mind, that is, to make them more powerful and enjoyable for people who use them. About Face 2.0 ensures that these objectives are met with the utmost ease and efficiency.<br /><br /> Alan Cooper (Palo Alto, CA) has spent a decade making high-tech products easier to use and less expensive to build-a practice known as \"Interaction Design.\" Cooper is now the leader in this growing field. Mr. Cooper is also the author of two bestselling books that are widely considered indispensable texts. About Face: The Essentials of User Interface Design, intro-duced the first comprehensive set of practical design principles. The Inmates Are Running the Asylum explains how talented people and companies continually create aggravating high-tech products that fail to meet customer expectations.<br /><br />Robert Reimann has spent the past 15 years pushing the boundaries of digital products as a designer, writer, lecturer, and consultant. He has led dozens of interaction design projects in domains including e-commerce, portals, desktop productivity, authoring environments, medical and scientific instrumentation, wireless, and handheld devices for startups and Fortune 500 clients alike. Joining Cooper in 1996, Reimann led the development and refinement of many goal-directed design methods described in About Face 2.0. He has lectured on these methods at major universities and to international industry audiences. He is a member of the advisory board of the UC Berkeley Institute of Design.",

    "description": "In these texts, Virginia Woolf considers the implications of the historical exclusion of women from education and from economic independence. In <i>A Room of One's Own</i> (1929), she examines the work of past women writers, and looks ahead to a time when women's creativity will not be hampered by poverty, or by oppression. In <i>Three Guineas</i> (1938), however, Woolf argues that women's historical exclusion offers them the chance to form a political and cultural identity which could challenge the drive towards fascism and war.",

This new novel by the internationally praised but not widely known Austrian writer is one of those\u2014a book of mysterious dark beauty . . . . [It] is overwhelming; one wants to read it again, immediately, to re-experience its intricate innovations, not to let go of this masterful work.\"\u2014John Rechy, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br /><br />\"Rudolph is not obstructed by some malfunctions in part of his being\u2014his being itself is a knot. And as Bernhard's narrative proceeds, we begin to register the dimensions of his crisis, its self-consuming circularity . . . . Where rage of this intensity is directed outward, we often find the sociopath; where inward, the suicide. Where it breaks out laterally, onto the page, we sometimes find a most unsettling artistic vision.\"\u2014Sven Birkerts, <i>The New Republic</i>",

    "description": "What is the status of belief in God? Must a rational case be made or can such belief be properly basic? Is it possible to reconcile the concept of a good God with evil and suffering? In light of great differences among religions, can only one religion be true?<br /> The most comprehensive work of its kind, Reason and Religious Belief, now in its fourth edition, explores these and other perennial questions in the philosophy of religion. Drawing from the best in both classical and contemporary discussions, the authors examine religious experience, faith and reason, the divine attributes, arguments for and against the existence of God, divine action (in various forms of theism), Reformed epistemology, religious language, religious diversity, religion and science, and much more.<br /> Retaining the engaging style and thorough coverage of previous editions, the fourth edition adds a critical new chapter on the ontological status of religion and the nature of religious claims. It also features revised treatments of omnipotence, miracles, and providence and updated suggestions for further reading. A sophisticated yet accessible introduction, Reason and Religious Belief, Fourth Edition, is ideally suited for use with the authors' companion anthology, Philosophy of Religion: Selected Readings, Third Edition (OUP, 2006).",

    "description": "Though known throughout the world for his fictional novels <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> and <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,</i> Mark Twain was also a skilled chronicler of his own life and experiences. In his youth, Twain traveled extensively throughout the untamed American West with his brother, working his way from town to town in a variety of jobs, including gold prospector, reporter, and lecturer. <i>Roughing It</i> is Twain's personal recollection of his wanderlust years. It is a wildly humorous adventure yarn that combines hard facts with a healthy dose of the author's unique perspective, one that helped define the course of American literature.",

    "description": "On 15 August 778, Charlemagne\u2019s army was returning from a successful expedition against Saracen Spain when its rearguard was ambushed in a remote Pyrenean pass. Out of this skirmish arose a stirring tale of war, which was recorded in the oldest extant epic poem in French. The Song of Roland, written by an unknown poet, tells of Charlemagne\u2019s warrior nephew, Lord of the Breton Marches, who valiantly leads his men into battle against the Saracens, but dies in the massacre, defiant to the end. In majestic verses, the battle becomes a symbolic struggle between Christianity and Islam, while Roland\u2019s last stand is the ultimate expression of honour and feudal values of twelfth-century France.",

    "description": "Arguably the first major American novel to satirize the political milieu of Washington, D.C. and the wild speculation schemes that exploded across the nation in the years that followed the Civil War, <i>The Gilded Age</i> gave this remarkable era its name. Co-written by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner, this rollicking novel is rife with unscrupulous politicians, colorful plutocrats, and blindly optimistic speculators caught up in a frenzy of romance, murder, and surefire deals gone bust. First published in 1873 and filled with unforgettable characters such as the vainglorious Colonel Sellers and the ruthless Senator Dilsworthy, <i>The Gilded Age</i> is a hilarious and instructive lesson in American history.<br /><br />Introduction by Ron Powers<br />Includes Newly Commissioned Endnotes",

    "description": "A comic masterpiece that has never been out of print since it was first published in 1889, Jerome K. Jerome's <i>Three Men in a Boat</i> includes an introduction and notes by Jeremy Lewis in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />Martyrs to hypochondria and general seediness, J. and his friends George and Harris decide that a jaunt up the Thames would suit them to a 'T'. But when they set off, they can hardly predict the troubles that lie ahead with tow-ropes, unreliable weather forecasts and tins of pineapple chunks - not to mention the devastation left in the wake of J.'s small fox-terrier Montmorency. <i>Three Men in a Boat</i> was an instant success when it appeared in 1889, and, with its benign escapism, authorial discursions and wonderful evocation of the late-Victorian 'clerking classes', it hilariously captured the spirit of its age.<br /><br />In his introduction, Jeremy Lewis examines Jerome K. Jerome's life and times, and the changing world of Victorian England he depicts - from the rise of a new mass-culture of tabloids and bestselling novels to crazes for daytripping and bicycling.",

    "description": "The definitive biography of the fascinating William James, whose life and writing put an indelible stamp on psychology, philosophy, teaching, and religion -- on modernism itself<br /><br />Pivotal member of the Metaphysical Club, author of The Varieties of Religious Experience, eldest sibling in the extraordinary James family, William emerges here as an immensely complex and curious man.<br /><br />William James, ten years in the making, draws on a vast number of unpublished letters, journals, and family records to illuminate what James himself called the \"buzzing blooming confusion\" of his life. Richardson shows James struggling to achieve amid the domestic chaos and intellectual brilliance of his father, his brother Henry, and his sister Alice. There are portraits of James's early years as a student at the appallingly hidebound Harvard of the 1860s. And there are the harrowing suicidal episodes, after which James, still a young man, turns from depression to action with \"a heave of will.\" Through impassioned scholarship, Richardson illuminates James's hugely influential works: the Varieties, Principles of Psychology, Talks to Teachers, and Pragmatism.<br /><br />As a longtime professor James taught courage and risk-taking. He was W.E.B. Du Bois's adviser and teacher, and he told another of his students, Gertrude Stein, to reject nothing -- that rejecting anything was the beginning of the end for an intellectual. One of the great figures in mysticism, James coined the phrase \"stream of consciousness.\"",

    "description": "For decades the Magistrate has been a loyal servant of the Empire, running the affairs of a tiny frontier settlement and ignoring the impending war with the barbarians. When interrogation experts arrive, however, he witnesses the Empire's cruel and unjust treatment of prisoners of war. Jolted into sympathy for their victims, he commits a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state.J. M. Coetzee's prize-winning novel is a startling allegory of the war between oppressor and oppressed. The Magistrate is not simply a man living through a crisis of conscience in an obscure place in remote times; his situation is that of all men living in unbearable complicity with regimes that ignore justice and decency.",

But the youthful passion that led them to Lookout Point that terrible evening would prove fatal. For Ritchie Walters the end came swiftly, as death descended upon him in a savage orgy of horrific violence. Elaine Murray would live long enough to learn just how lucky her boyfriend had been ...<br /><br />Two brutal slayings have rocked a stunned city. But the murders are merely the nightmare's beginning, flinging open a terrifying Pandora's box of sordid secrets and dark revelations more deadly than the bloodlust that lives in the rock-hard heart of a killer.",

    "description": "Darkness has fallen on the city of Portland, Oregon. One by one, the wives of affluent and respected men are vanishing from their homes. The only clues to their disappearance are a single black rose and a note that reads \"Gone, But Not Forgotten.\" It is the rebirth of a horror that has already devastated a community at the opposite end of the country -- and, as it did then, terror and death will follow.<br /><br />Defense attorney Betsy Tannenbaum is trapped in a nightmare as the shadows of a killer darken her world. And she will soon be risking everything she has and everyone she loves to defend a cold, powerful, and manipulating client who may be a victim ... or a monster.",

    "description": "The wildest thriller yet from \"one of America's most influential authors\" (New York Times)...Working as a lifeguard at a luxurious Florida resort, Ned Kelly meets the woman of his dreams. It feels perfect in every way-except that she's used to caviar and Manolo Blahniks, and he's used to burgers and flip-flops.So when Ned's cousin offers to cut him in on a fast break-and-enter job, Ned can't turn it down. The risk is high, and the reward is even greater-$5 million. But the robbery goes devastatingly wrong. Forced to run away from his town and the woman he's fallen in love with, Ned knows that only distance and secrecy can save his life. But who is pursuing him? The FBI? Whoever sabotaged the heist? Or is it all somehow tied in to his new love-and his oldest enemies?",

But faced with a tormenting life-and-death decision, Abby helps direct a crash victim's harvested heart to a dying teenager -- instead of the wealthy older woman who was supposed to receive it. The repercussions leave Abby shaken and plagued with self-doubt.<br /><br />Suddenly, a new heart appears, and the woman's transplant is completed. Then Abby makes a terrible discovery. The donor records have been falsified -- the new heart has not come through the proper channels. Defying the hospital's demands for silence, she begins her own investigation that reveals a murderous, unthinkable conspiracy. Every move Abby makes spawns a vicious backlash...and on a ship anchored in the waters of Boston harbor, the grisly truth lies waiting.",

    "description": "Few albums in the canon of popular music have had the influence, resonance, and endurance of John Coltrane's 1965 classic <i>A Love Supreme</i>-a record that proved jazz was a fitting medium for spiritual exploration and for the expression of the sublime. Bringing the same fresh and engaging approach that characterized his critically acclaimed <i>Kind of Blue: The Making of the Miles Davis Masterpiece</i>, Ashley Kahn tells the story of the genesis, creation, and aftermath of this classic recording. Featuring interviews with more than one hundred musicians, producers, friends, and family members; unpublished interviews with Coltrane and bassist Jimmy Garrison; and scores of never-before-seen photographs, <i>A Love Supreme</i> balances biography, cultural context, and musical analysis in a passionate and revealing portrait.",

    "description": "The first biography of the legendary track coach, and founder of Nike, who had an unparalleled impact on the sport of running<br /><br />During his tenure as track coach at the University of Oregon from 1949 through 1972, Bill Bowerman won 4 national team titles, trained dozens of milers to break the 4-minute barrier, and his athletes set 13 world and 22 American records. Single-handedly he helped turn the college town of Eugene, Oregon, into the running capital of the world.<br /><br />In Bowerman: The Wings of Nike, Kenny Moore, a world-class marathon runner and one of Bowerman's Oregon men, tells the story of his mentor and hero, drawing on years of taped interviews and the full cooperation of the Bowerman family and Nike, the company that Bowerman helped to found through his invention of the waffle-soled running shoe.<br /><br />Whether providing a fresh look at the tragic siege at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games, where Bowerman coached the track and field team; offering a close-up view of the coach's relationship with runner Steve Prefontaine (subject of the movie Without Limits, co-written and co-produced by Moore); or exploring Bowerman's role as a Nike innovator, this illuminating portrait is compelling reading throughout\u2014ample evidence of why Bowerman's widow, noting how well the author understood her husband, said: \"If anyone should write Bill's life story, it's Kenny Moore.\"",

Yet returning to her hometown also brings her back to Hollis, March\u2019s former soul mate and lover. March\u2019s father had taken the teenaged Hollis, an abandoned child, and the product of a series of detention homes, into his house as a boarder, and treated him like a son. Yet March and Hollis\u2019s passionate love was hardly a normal sibling relationship. When Hollis left her after a petty fight, March waited for him three long years, wondering what she had done wrong.<br /><br />Encountering Hollis again makes March acutely aware of the choices that she has made, and the choices everyone around her has made\u2014including Mrs. Dale, who knew more of love than March could ever have suspected, and her brother Alan, whose tragic history has left him grief-struck, with alcohol as his only solace. Her attraction to Hollis is overwhelming\u2014and March jeopardizes her marriage, her relationship with her daughter and her own happiness in an attempt to reclaim the past.",

Kerouac's love of America, his compassion for humanity, and his sense of language as jazz combine to make On the Road an inspirational work of lasting importance.<br />Kerouac's classic novel of freedom and longing defined what it meant to be \"Beat\" and has inspired every generation since its initial publication more than forty years ago.",

Replete with potent symbolism and terrifying surrealistic imagery, Sadegh Hedayat's masterpice details a young man's despair after losing a mysterious lover. And as the author gradually drifts into frenzy and madness, the reader becomes caught in the sandstorm of Hedayat's bleak vision of the human condition. The Blind Owl, which has been translated into many foreign languages, has often been compared to the writing of Edgar Allan Poe.",

    "description": "By the award-winning author of <i>Team of Rivals </i>and <i>The Bully Pulpit</i>, <i>Wait Till Next Year</i> is Doris Kearns Goodwin\u2019s touching memoir of growing up in love with her family and baseball.<br /><br />Set in the suburbs of New York in the 1950s, <i>Wait Till Next Year</i> re-creates the postwar era, when the corner store was a place to share stories and neighborhoods were equally divided between Dodger, Giant, and Yankee fans.<br /><br /> We meet the people who most influenced Goodwin\u2019s early life: her mother, who taught her the joy of books but whose debilitating illness left her housebound: and her father, who taught her the joy of baseball and to root for the Dodgers of Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, Duke Snider, and Gil Hodges. Most important, Goodwin describes with eloquence how the Dodgers\u2019 leaving Brooklyn in 1957, and the death of her mother soon after, marked both the end of an era and, for her, the end of childhood.",

Then, on the day she gives birth to their first baby, James informs her that he's leaving her. Claire is left with a newborn daughter, a broken heart, and a postpartum body that she can hardly bear to look at.<br /><br />She decides to go home to Dublin. And there, sheltered by the love of a quirky family, she gets better. So much so, in fact, that when James slithers back into her life, he's in for a bit of a surprise.",

    "description": "Soren Kierkegaard was a Danish philosopher, theologian, and religious author interested in human psychology. He is regarded as a leading pioneer of existentialism and one of the greatest philosophers of the 19th Century.<br /><br />In <i>Fear and Trembling</i>, Kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety that must have been present in Abraham when God commanded him to offer his son as a human sacrifice. Abraham had a choice to complete the task or to forget it. He resigned himself to the loss of his son, acting according to his faith. In other words, one must be willing to give up all his or her earthly possessions in infinite resignation and must also be willing to give up whatever it is that he or she loves more than God. Abraham had passed the test -- his love for God proved greater than anything else in him. And because a good and just Creator would not want a father to kill his son, God intervened at the last moment to prevent the sacrifice.",

    "description": "In 1978 Lila Abu-Lughod climbed out of a dusty van to meet members of a small Awlad 'Ali Bedouin community. Living in this Egyptian Bedouin settlement for extended periods during the following decade, Abu-Lughod took part in family life, with its moments of humor, affection, and anger. She witnessed striking changes, both cultural and economic, and she recorded the stories of the women. <i>Writing Women's Worlds</i> is Abu-Lughod's telling of those stories; it is also about what happens in bringing the stories to others.<br /><br />As the new teller of these tales Abu-Lughod draws on anthropological and feminist insights to construct a critical ethnography. She explores how the telling of these stories challenges the power of anthropological theory to render adequately the lives of others and the way feminist theory appropriates Third World women. <i>Writing Women's Worlds</i> is thus at once a vivid set of stories and a study in the politics of representation.",

    "description": "<i>\"It depends on the Jews themselves whether this political pamphlet remains for the present a political romance. If the present generation is too dull to understand it rightly, a future, finer and better generation will arise to understand it. The Jews who wish for a State shall have it, and they will deserve to have it.\"</i>\u2014Preface<br />Theodor Herzl's passionate advocacy of the founding of a Jewish state grew out of his conviction that Jews would never be assimilated into\u00a0the populations in which they lived. Born in Budapest, Hungary in 1860, Herzl encountered anti-Semitism when he attended a scientific secondary school. Later, as a newspaper correspondent in Paris, he was shocked and dismayed by the anti-Semitic prejudice surrounding the notorious Dreyfus affair (Herzl said in later years that it was the\u00a0Dreyfus affair that had made a Zionist out of him). Herzl concluded that the only solution for the majority of Jews would\u00a0be organized emigration to a state of their own.<br />He discussed the political and historic rationale for such a homeland in this extraordinary and influential book, first published as a pamphlet, <i>Der Judenstaat</i>, in Vienna in 1896. The Jewish question, he wrote, was not a social or religious question but a\u00a0national question that could be solved\u00a0only by making it \"a political world question to be discussed and settled by the civilized nations of the world in council.\" In 1897, at a world congress of Zionism, he declared, \"We want\u00a0to lay the foundation stone for the house which will become the refuge of the Jewish nation. Zionism is the return to Judaism even before the return to the land of Israel.\"<br />The present volume is a complete and unabridged republication of The Jewish State, reproduced from the edition published by the American Zionist Emergency Council, New York, 1946. Translated by Sylvie D'Avigdor, it includes an introduction by Louis Lipsky, and a biography of Herzl based on the work of Alex Bein. For Jews, scholars, historians, anyone seeking to understand the history of the 20th century, <i>The Jewish State</i> is indispensable reading. This edition makes it widely available in an inexpensive high-quality format.<br />",

Dante is the catalyst for change in other characters as well, and they step forward with their narratives: Rae's house-tender; her therapist; two veterinarians; and an anxiety-ridden actor, Howard, who turns out to be as stalwart as Dante himself. As the \"seer\" who hunts by sight rather than smell, Dante has some things to add, as does Rose, another dog who lives at Rae's heels, and Stanley the cat. Among and above these myriad voices, Rae voices her own challenges. With the wit and dead-on candor we've come to expect from Pam Houston, <em>Sight Hound</em> unfolds a story that illuminates the intangible covenant between loved ones. Here, dogs and humans are simply equal creatures, looking to connect and holding on for dear life when they do. Reading group guide included.",

    "description": "In this poignant and humorous work, Virginia Woolf observes that though illness is part of every human being\u2019s experience, it has never been the subject of literature\u2014like the more acceptable subjects of war and love. We cannot quote Shakespeare to describe a headache. We must, Woolf says, invent language to describe pain. And though illness enhances our perceptions, she observes that it reduces self-consciousness; it is \"the great confessional.\" Woolf discusses the cultural taboos associated with illness and explores how illness changes the way we read. Poems clarify and astonish, Shakespeare exudes new brilliance, and so does melodramatic fiction!<br /><br /><i>On Being Ill </i>was published as an individual volume by Hogarth Press in 1930. While other Woolf essays, such as <i>A Room of One\u2019s Own </i>and <i>Three Guineas, </i>were first published by Hogarth as individual volumes and have since been widely available<i>, On Being Ill</i> has been overlooked. The Paris Press edition features original cover art by Woolf\u2019s sister, the painter Vanessa Bell. Hermione Lee\u2019s Introduction discusses this extraordinary work, and explores Woolf\u2019s revelations about poetry, language, and illness.<br /><br /><br />",

    "description": "Ninety miles north of Seattle on the Washington coast lies Bellingham Bay, where a rough settlement founded in the 1850s would become the town of Whatcom. Here, the Lummi and Nooksack Indian people fish and farm, hermits pay their debts in sockeye salmon, and miners track gold-bearing streams.<br /><br />Here, too, is the intimate, murderous tale of three men. Clare Fishburn believes that greatness lies in store for him. John Ireland Sharp, an educated orphan, abandons hope when he sees socialists expel the Chinese workers from the region. Beal Obenchain, who lives in a cedar stump, threatens Clare Fishburn's life. <br /><br />A killer lashes a Chinese worker to a wharf piling at low tide. Settlers pour in to catch the boom the railroads bring. People give birth, drown, burn, inherit rich legacies, and commit expensive larcenies. All this takes place a hundred years ago, when these vital, ruddy men and women were ''the living.''",

He never imagines he would encounter anyone whose intellect matched his own, much less an audacious teenage girl with a penchant for detection.

    "description": "The world is about to run out of cheap oil and change dramatically. Within the next few years, global production will peak. Thereafter, even if industrial societies begin to switch to alternative energy sources, they will have less net energy each year to do all the work essential to the survival of complex societies. We are entering a new era, as different from the industrial era as the latter was from medieval times.<br /><br />In <i>The Party\u2019s Over</i>, Richard Heinberg places this momentous transition in historical context, showing how industrialism arose from the harnessing of fossil fuels, how competition to control access to oil shaped the geopolitics of the twentieth century and how contention for dwindling energy resources in the twenty-first century will lead to resource wars in the Middle East, Central Asia and South America. He describes the likely impacts of oil depletion and all of the energy alternatives. Predicting chaos unless the United States\u2014the world\u2019s foremost oil consumer\u2014is willing to join with other countries to implement a global program of resource conservation and sharing, he also recommends a \u201cmanaged collapse\u201d that might make way for a slower-paced, low-energy, sustainable society in the future.<br /><br />More readable than other accounts of this issue, with fuller discussion of the context, social implications and recommendations for personal, community, national and global action, Heinberg\u2019s updated book is a riveting wake-up call for human-kind as the oil era winds down, and a critical tool for understanding and influencing current US foreign policy.<br /><br /><b>Richard Heinberg</b>, from Santa Rosa, California, has been writing about energy resources issues and the dynamics of cultural change for many years. A member of the core faculty at New College of California, he is an award-winning author of three previous books. His <i>Museletter</i> was nominated for the Best Alternative Newsletter award by <i>Utne</i> in 1993.",

    "description": "From Kevin Brockmeier, one of this generation's most inventive young writers, comes a striking new novel about death, life, and the mysterious place in between. The City is inhabited by those who have departed Earth but are still remembered by the living. They will reside in this afterlife until they are completely forgotten. But the City is shrinking, and the residents clearing out. Some of the holdouts, like Luka Sims, who produces the City\u2019s only newspaper, are wondering what exactly is going on. Others, like Coleman Kinzler, believe it is the beginning of the end. Meanwhile, Laura Byrd is trapped in an Antarctic research station, her supplies are running low, her radio finds only static, and the power is failing. With little choice, Laura sets out across the ice to look for help, but time is running out. Kevin Brockmeier alternates these two storylines to create a lyrical and haunting story about love, loss and the power of memory.",

    "description": "Chicago Stars quarterback Dean Robillard is the luckiest man in the world: a bona-fide sports superstar and the pride of the NFL with a profitable side career as a buff billboard model for End Zone underwear. But life in the glory lane has started to pale, and Dean has set off on a cross-country trip to figure out what's gone wrong. When he hits a lonely stretch of Colorado highway, he spies something that will shake up his gilded life in ways he can't imagine. A young woman . . . dressed in a beaver suit.<br /><br />Blue Bailey is on a mission to murder her ex. Or at least inflict serious damage. As for the beaver suit she's wearing . . . Is it her fault that life keeps throwing her curveballs? Witness the expensive black sports car pulling up next to her on the highway and the Greek god stepping out of it.<br /><br />Blue's career as a portrait painter is the perfect job for someone who refuses to stay in one place for very long. She needs a ride, and America's most famous football player has an imposing set of wheels. Now, all she has to do is keep him entertained, off guard, and fully clothed before he figures out exactly how desperate she is.<br /><br />But Dean isn't the brainless jock she imagines, and Blue\u2014despite her petite stature\u2014is just about the toughest woman Dean has ever met. They're soon heading for his summer home where their already complicated lives and inconvenient attraction to each other will become entangled with a charismatic but aging rock star; a beautiful fifty-two-year-old woman trying to make peace with her rock and roll past; an eleven-year-old who desperately needs a family; and a bitter old woman who hates them all.<br /><br />As the summer progresses, the wandering portrait artist and the charming football star play a high-stakes game, fighting themselves and each other for a chance to have it all.<br /><br /><em>Natural Born Charmer</em> is for everyone who's ever thought about leaving their old life in the dust and never looking back. <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author Susan Elizabeth Phillips takes us home again . . . and shows us where love truly lives",

    "description": "\"A magic curtain, woven of legends, hung before the world,\" writes Milan Kundera in <em>The Curtain</em>, his fascinating new book on the art of the novel. \"Cervantes sent Don Quixote journeying and tore through the curtain. The world opened before the knight-errant in all the comical nakedness of its prose.\" For Kundera, that curtain represents a ready-made perception of the world that each of us has\u2014a pre-interpreted world. The job of the novelist, he argues, is to rip through the curtain and reveal what it hides.<br /><br />In this entertaining and always stimulating essay, Kundera cleverly sketches out his personal view of the history and value of the novel in Western civilization. Too often, he suggests, a novel is thought about only within the confines of the language and nation of its origin, when in fact the novel's development has always occurred across borders: Laurence Sterne learned from Rabelais, Henry Fielding from Cervantes, Joyce from Flaubert, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez from Kafka. The real work of a novel is not bound up in the specifics of any one language: what makes a novel matter is its ability to reveal some previously unknown aspect of our existence. In <em>The Curtain</em>, Kundera skillfully describes how the best novels do just that.",

If, even for a moment, you thought that a proven and popular book might be the one you were interested in, you may have been persuaded by a potent principle of influence-in this case, the principle of social proof. Have you ever found yourself saying yes to a telemarketer or to a child selling candy and then wonder why you have just agreed to subscribe to a magazine that you really arent interested in or to buy a candy bar that you really dont want? In this revised, updated, and expanded book, not only will you find out what techniques were used to get you to say yes, but you will also learn some worthwhile ways to defend yourself from future requests.",

It looks like one country on CNN, a very different one on al-Jazeera.

But how does Israel look to Israelis?<br /><br />Israel is smaller than New Jersey, with 0.11% of the world's population, yet captures a lion's share of headlines. It looks like one country on CNN, a very different one on al-Jazeera. The BBC has their version, <i>The New York Times</i> theirs. But how does Israel look to Israelis? The answers are varied, and they have been brought together here in one of the most original books about Israel in decades. From battlefields to bedrooms to boardrooms, discover the colliding worlds in which an astounding mix of 7.2 million devoutly traditional and radically modern people live. You'll meet \u201cArab Jews\u201d who fled Islamic countries, dreadlock-wearing Ethiopian immigrants who sing reggae in Hebrew, Christians in Nazareth who publish an Arabic-style <i>Cosmo</i>, young Israeli Muslims who know more about Judaism than most Jews of the Diaspora, ultra-Orthodox Jews on \u201cModesty Patrols,\u201d and more. Interweaving hundreds of personal stories with intriguing new research, <i>The Israelis</i> is lively, irreverent, and always fascinating.",

    "description": "President Bill Clinton\u2019s <i>My Life</i> is the strikingly candid portrait of a global leader who decided early in life to devote his intellectual and political gifts, and his extraordinary capacity for hard work, to serving the public. <br /><br />It shows us the progress of a remarkable American, who, through his own enormous energies and efforts, made the unlikely journey from Hope, Arkansas, to the White House\u2014a journey fueled by an impassioned interest in the political process which manifested itself at every stage of his life: in college, working as an intern for Senator William Fulbright; at Oxford, becoming part of the Vietnam War protest movement; at Yale Law School, campaigning on the grassroots level for Democratic candidates; back in Arkansas, running for Congress, attorney general, and governor.<br /><br />We see his career shaped by his resolute determination to improve the life of his fellow citizens, an unfaltering commitment to civil rights, and an exceptional understanding of the practicalities of political life.<br /><br />We come to understand the emotional pressures of his youth\u2014born after his father\u2019s death; caught in the dysfunctional relationship between his feisty, nurturing mother and his abusive stepfather, whom he never ceased to love and whose name he took; drawn to the brilliant, compelling Hillary Rodham, whom he was determined to marry; passionately devoted, from her infancy, to their daughter, Chelsea, and to the entire experience of fatherhood; slowly and painfully beginning to comprehend how his early denial of pain led him at times into damaging patterns of behavior.<br /><br />President Clinton\u2019s book is also the fullest, most concretely detailed, most nuanced account of a presidency ever written\u2014encompassing not only the high points and crises but the way the presidency actually works: the day-to-day bombardment of problems, personalities, conflicts, setbacks, achievements.<br /><br />It is a testament to the positive impact on America and on the world of his work and his ideals.<br /><br />It is the gripping account of a president under concerted and unrelenting assault orchestrated by his enemies on the Far Right, and how he survived and prevailed. <br /><br />It is a treasury of moments caught alive, among them:<br /><br />\u2022 The ten-year-old boy watching the national political conventions on his family\u2019s new (and first) television set.<br /><br />\u2022 The young candidate looking for votes in the Arkansas hills and the local seer who tells him, \u201cAnybody who would campaign at a beer joint in Joiner at midnight on Saturday night deserves to carry one box. . . . You\u2019ll win here. But it\u2019ll be the only damn place you win in this county.\u201d (He was right on both counts.)<br /><br />\u2022 The roller-coaster ride of the 1992 campaign.<br /><br />\u2022 The extraordinarily frank exchanges with Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole.<br /><br />\u2022 The delicate manipulation needed to convince Rabin and Arafat to shake hands for the camera while keeping Arafat from kissing Rabin.<br /><br />\u2022 The cost, both public and private, of the scandal that threatened the presidency.<br /><br />Here is the life of a great national and international figure, revealed with all his talents and contradictions, told openly, directly, in his own completely recognizable voice. A unique book by a unique American.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "<i>The Feast of Love</i> is a sumptuous work of fiction about the thing that most distracts and delights us. In a re-imagined <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, men and women speak of and desire their ideal mates; parents seek out their lost children; adult children try to come to terms with their own parents and, in some cases, find new ones.<br /><br />In vignettes both comic and sexy, the owner of a coffee shop recalls the day his first wife seemed to achieve a moment of simple perfection, while she remembers the women's softball game during which she was stricken by the beauty of the shortstop. A young couple spends hours at the coffee shop fueling the idea of their fierce love. A professor of philosophy, stopping by for a cup of coffee, makes a valiant attempt to explain what he knows to be the inexplicable workings of the human heart Their voices resonate with each other--disparate people joined by the meanderings of love--and come together in a tapestry that depicts the most irresistible arena of life.",

    "description": "True North is the story of a family torn apart and a man engaged in profound reckoning with the damage scarred into the American soil. The scion of a family of wealthy timber barons, David Burkett has grown up with a father who is a malevolent force more than a father, and a mother made vague and numb by alcohol and pills. He and his sister, Cynthia, a firecracker who scandalizes the family at fourteen by taking up with the son of their Finnish-Native American gardener, are mostly left to make their own way, and often to play parent to their dissolute elders. As David comes to adulthood - often guided and enlightened by the unforgettable, intractable, courageous women he loves - he realizes he must come to terms with his forefathers' rapacious destruction of the woods of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, as well as the working people who made their wealth possible. In the course of thirty years of searching for the truth of what his family has done and trying to make amends, David looks closely at the root of his father's evil - and threatens to destroy himself.",

    "description": "Al Franken, one of our savviest satirists (<i>People</i>), has been studying the rhetoric of the Right. He has listened to their cries of slander, bias, and even treason. He has examined the Bush administration's policies of squandering our surplus, ravaging the environment, and alienating the rest of the world. He's even watched Fox News. A lot. <p> And, in this fair and balanced report, Al bravely and candidly exposes them all for what they are: liars. Lying, lying liars. Al destroys the liberal media bias myth by doing what his targets seem incapable of: getting his facts straight. Using the Right's own words against them, he takes on the pundits, the politicians, and the issues, in the most talked about book of the year.<br /><br />Timely, provocative, unfailingly honest, and always funny, <i>Lies</i> sticks it to the most right-wing administration in memory, and to the right-wing media hacks who do its bidding.</p>",

    "description": "Set in the deep south that provided the backdrop for all of Faulkner's finest fiction, Intruder in the Dust is the novel that marks the final phase of its author's outstanding creative period. The chronicle of an elderly black farmer arrested for the murder of a white man and under threat from the lynch mob is a characteristically Faulknerian tale of dark omen, its sole ray of hope the character of the young white boy who repays an old favour by proving the innocence of the man who saved him from drowning in an icy creek.",

    "description": "Celebrated humanist, teacher, and scholar, Edward W. Said here examines the ever-changing role of the intellectual today. In these six stunning essays - delivered on the BBC as the prestigious Reith Lectures - Said addresses the ways in which the intellectual can best serve society in the light of a heavily compromised media and of special interest groups who are protected at the cost of larger community concerns. Said suggests a recasting of the intellectual's vision to resist the lures of power, money, and specialization. in these powerful pieces, Said eloquently illustrates his arguments by drawing on such writers as Antonio Gramsci, Jean-Paul Sartre, Regis Debray, Julien Benda, and Adorno, and by discussing current events and celebrated figures in the world of science and politics: Robert Oppenheimer, Henry Kissinger, Dan Quayle, Vietnam, and the Gulf War. Said sees the modern intellectual as an editor, journalist, academic, or political adviser - in other words, a highly specialized professional - who has moved from a position of independence to an alliance with powerful institutional organizations. He concludes that it is the exile-immigrant, the expatriate, and the amateur who must uphold the traditional role of the intellectual as the voice of integrity and courage, able to speak out against those in power.<br /><br />BBC episodes presented by Edward Said: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gmx4c/episodes/player\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gm...</a>",

Instead of describing their outward expressions of grief, Virgina Woolf draws her characters from the inside, revealing them through their thoughts and interior soliloquies. As their understanding of nature\u2019s trials grows, the chorus of narrative voices blends together in miraculous harmony, remarking not only on the inevitable death of individuals but on the eternal connection of everyone. The novel that most epitomizes Virginia Woolf\u2019s theories of fiction in the working form, <i>The Waves</i> is an amazing book very much ahead of its time. It is a poetic dreamscape, visual, experimental, and thrilling.",

    "description": "The six stories in Haruki Murakami\u2019s mesmerizing collection are set at the time of the catastrophic 1995 Kobe earthquake, when Japan became brutally aware of the fragility of its daily existence. But the upheavals that afflict Murakami\u2019s characters are even deeper and more mysterious, emanating from a place where the human meets the inhuman. <br /><br />An electronics salesman who has been abruptly deserted by his wife agrees to deliver an enigmatic package\u2014and is rewarded with a glimpse of his true nature. A man who has been raised to view himself as the son of God pursues a stranger who may or may not be his human father. A mild-mannered collection agent receives a visit from a giant talking frog who enlists his help in saving Tokyo from destruction. As haunting as dreams, as potent as oracles, the stories in<i> </i><b>After the Quake</b> are further proof that Murakami is one of the most visionary writers at work today.",

    "description": "Risky in conception, hip and yet soulful, this is a prose poem of a novel -- intense, lyrical, and highly evocative -- with a mystery at its center, which keeps the reader in suspense until the final page. In a tour de force that could be described as Altmanesque, we are invited into the private lives of the residents of a quiet urban street in England over the course of a single day. In delicate, intricately observed closeup, we witness the hopes, fears, and unspoken despairs of a diverse community: the man with painfully scarred hands who tried in vain to save his wife from a burning house and who must now care for his young daughter alone; a group of young clubgoers just home from an all-night rave, sweetly high and mulling over vague dreams; the nervous young man at number 18 who collects weird urban junk and is haunted by the specter of unrequited love. The tranquillity of the street is shattered at day's end when a terrible accident occurs. This tragedy and an utterly surprising twist provide the momentum for the book. But it is the author's exquisite rendering of the ordinary, the everyday, that gives this novel its freshness, its sense of beauty, wonder, and hope. Rarely does a writer appear with so much music and poetry -- so much vision -- that he can make the world seem new.",

    "description": "At the height of WWI, history\u2019s most lethal influenza virus erupted in an army camp in Kansas, moved east with American troops, then exploded, killing as many as 100 million people worldwide. It killed more people in twenty-four months than AIDS killed in twenty-four years, more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century. But this was not the Middle Ages, and 1918 marked the first collision of science and epidemic disease. Magisterial in its breadth of perspective and depth of research and now revised to reflect the growing danger of the avian flu, <i>The Great Influenza</i> is ultimately a tale of triumph amid tragedy, which provides us with a precise and sobering model as we confront the epidemics looming on our own horizon. John M. Barry has written a new afterword for this edition that brings us up to speed on the terrible threat of the avian flu and suggest ways in which we might head off another flu pandemic.",

Every night I couldn\u2019t sleep from the pain in my back. We were digging an excavation in an empty lot, there wasn\u2019t any shade, the sun came straight from a cloudless sky, and I was down in that hole digging with two huskies who dug with a love for it, always laughing and telling jokes, laughing and smoking bitter tobacco.",

    "description": "<b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER &amp; NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE<br /><br />Straight from the front line of urban America, the inspiring story of one fiercely determined teacher and her remarkable students.<br /></b><br />As an idealistic twenty-three-year-old English teacher at Wilson High School in Long beach, California, Erin Gruwell confronted a room of \u201cunteachable, at-risk\u201d students. One day she intercepted a note with an ugly racial caricature, and angrily declared that this was precisely the sort of thing that led to the Holocaust\u2014only to be met by uncomprehending looks. So she and her students, using the treasured books <i>Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl</i> and <i>Zlata\u2019s Diary: A Child\u2019s Life in Sarajevo</i> as their guides, undertook a life-changing, eye-opening, spirit-raising odyssey against intolerance and misunderstanding. They learned to see the parallels in these books to their own lives, recording their thoughts and feelings in diaries and dubbing themselves the \u201cFreedom Writers\u201d in homage to the civil rights activists \u201cThe Freedom Riders.\u201d<br /><br />With funds raised by a \u201cRead-a-thon for Tolerance,\u201d they arranged for Miep Gies, the courageous Dutch woman who sheltered the Frank family, to visit them in California, where she declared that Erin Gruwell\u2019s students were \u201cthe real heroes.\u201d Their efforts have paid off spectacularly, both in terms of recognition\u2014appearances on \u201cPrime Time Live\u201d and \u201cAll Things Considered,\u201d coverage in <i>People</i> magazine, a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley\u2014and educationally. All 150 Freedom Writers have graduated from high school and are now attending college.<br /><br />With powerful entries from the students\u2019 own diaries and a narrative text by Erin Gruwell, <i>The Freedom Writers Diary</i> is an uplifting, unforgettable example of how hard work, courage, and the spirit of determination changed the lives of a teacher and her students. <br /><br />The authors\u2019 proceeds from this book will be donated to The Tolerance Education Foundation, an organization set up to pay for the Freedom Writers\u2019 college tuition. Erin Gruwell is now a visiting professor at California State University, Long Beach, where some of her students are Freedom Writers.",

In <i>Guns, Germs and Steel</i> Jared Diamond presents the biologist's answer: geography, demography and ecological happenstance. Diamond evenhandedly reviews human history on every continent since the Ice Age at a rate that emphasizes only the broadest movements of peoples and ideas. Yet his survey is binocular: one eye has the rather distant vision of the evolutionary biologist, while the other eye--and his heart--belongs to the people of New Guinea, where he has done field work for more than 30 years.",

    "description": "Jack Taylor is walking the delicate edge of a sobriety he doesn't trust when his phone rings. He's in debt to a Galway tough named Bill Cassell, what the locals call a \"hard man.\" Bill did Jack a big favor a while back; the trouble is, he never lets a favor go unreturned.<br /><br />Jack is amazed when Cassell simply asks him to track down a woman, now either dead or very old, who long ago helped his mother escape from the notorious Magdalen laundry, where young wayward girls were imprisoned and abused. Jack doesn't like the odds of finding the woman, but counts himself lucky that the task is at least on the right side of the law.<br /><br />Until he spends a few days spinning his wheels and is dragged in front of Cassell for a quick reminder of his priorites. Bill's goons do a little spinning of their own, playing a game of Russian roulette a little too close to the back of Jack's head. It's only blind luck and the mercy of a god he no longer trusts that land Jack back on the street rather than face down in a cellar with a bullet in his skull. He's got one chance to stay alive: find this woman.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he can't escape his own curiosity, and an unnerving hunch quickly turns into a solid fact: just who Jack's looking for, and why, aren't nearly what they seem.<br /><br /><i>The Magdalen Martyrs</i>, the third Galway-set novel by Edgar, Barry, and Macavity finalist and Shamus Award-winner Ken Bruen, is a gripping, dazzling story that takes the Jack Taylor series to explosive new heights of suspense.",

    "description": "George Stroud is a hard-drinking, tough-talking, none-too-scrupulous writer for a New York media conglomerate that bears a striking resemblance to Time, Inc. in the heyday of Henry Luce. One day, before heading home to his wife in the suburbs, Stroud has a drink with Pauline, the beautiful girlfriend of his boss, Earl Janoth. Things happen. The next day Stroud escorts Pauline home, leaving her off at the corner just as Janoth returns from a trip. The day after that, Pauline is found murdered in her apartment.<br /><br />Janoth knows there was one witness to his entry into Pauline\u2019s apartment on the night of the murder; he knows that man must have been the man Pauline was with before he got back; but he doesn\u2019t know who he was. Janoth badly wants to get his hands on that man, and he picks one of his most trusted employees to track him down: George Stroud, who else?<br /><br />How does a man escape from himself? No book has ever dramatized that question to more perfect effect than <i>The Big Clock</i>, a masterpiece of American noir.",

    "description": "Kees Popinga is an average man, a solid citizen who might enjoy a game of chess in the evening. But one night, this model husband and devoted father discovers his boss is bankrupt and that his own carefully tended life is in ruins. Before, he had watched impassively as the trains swept by; now he catches the first one out of town and soon commits murder before the night is out. How reliable is even the most reliable man's identity? <br /><br />Georges Simenon (1903-1989) was born in Liege, Belgium. He went to work as a reporter at the age of fifteen and in 1923 moved to Paris, where under various pseudonyms he became a highly successful and prolific author of pulp fiction while leading a dazzling social life. In the early 1930s, Simenon emerged as a writer under his own name, gaining renown for his detective stories featuring Inspector Maigret. He also began to write his psychological novels, or romans durs - books in which he displays a sympathetic awareness of the emotional and spiritual pain underlying the routines of daily life. Having written nearly two hundred books under his own name and become the best-selling author in the world, Simenon retired as a novelist in 1973, devoting himself instead to dictating memoirs that filled thousands of pages.",

    "description": "<i>The Three Incestuous Sisters</i> is an evocative, illustrated book by the best-selling author of <i>The Time Traveler's Wife</i>, Audrey Niffenegger. Reminiscent of the gothic style of Edward Gorey, Niffenegger's visually stunning narrative affirms her genius as a storyteller. These rich pages present the tale of three very different sisters: one who is beautiful, one who is smart, and one who is talented. A melodrama of sibling rivalry unfurls as one sister is driven mad with jealousy due to the passionate love affair of another. Escalating to a dizzying climax, the romance of the two lovers ends in sabotage, shame, and despair. Haunting illustrations and lyrical prose depict a timeless tale of love, revenge, and ultimately, transcendence. <br /><br /><i>The Three Incestuous Sisters</i> is a unique and lavish tour de force, which showcases Audrey Niffenegger's incredible talent as an artist and a writer.",

    "description": "From the author of the widely acclaimed King Leopold's Ghost comes the taut, gripping account of one of the most brilliantly organized social justice campaigns in history - the fight to free the slaves of the British Empire. In early 1787, twelve men - a printer, a lawyer, a clergyman, and others united by their hatred of slavery - came together in a London printing shop and began the world's first grass-roots movement, battling for the rights of people on another continent. Masterfully stoking public opinion, the movement's leaders pioneered a variety of techniques that have been adopted by citizens' movements ever since, from consumer boycotts to wall posters and lapel buttons to celebrity endorsements. A deft chronicle of this groundbreaking antislavery crusade and its powerful enemies, Bury the Chains gives a little-celebrated human rights watershed its due at last.",

    "description": "This national bestseller exploring the complex emotional lives of animals was hailed as \"a masterpiece\" by Elizabeth Marshall Thomas and as \"marvelous\" by Jane Goodall.<br /><br />The popularity of <i>When Elephants Weep</i> has swept the nation, as author Jeffrey Masson appeared on <i>Dateline NBC, Good Morning America,</i> and was profiled in <i>People</i> for his ground-breaking and fascinating study. Not since Darwin's <i>The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals</i> has a book so thoroughly and effectively explored the full range of emotions that exist throughout the animal kingdom.<br /><br />From dancing squirrels to bashful gorillas to spiteful killer whales, Masson and coauthor Susan McCarthy bring forth fascinating anecdotes and illuminating insights that offer powerful proof of the existence of animal emotion. Chapters on love, joy, anger, fear, shame, compassion, and loneliness are framed by a provocative re-evaluation of how we treat animals, from hunting and eating them to scientific experimentation. Forming a complete and compelling picture of the inner lives of animals, <i>When Elephants Weep</i> assures that we will never look at animals in the same way again.",

    "description": "Popular Music from Vittula tells the fantastical story of a young boy's unordinary existence, peopled by a visiting African priest, a witch in the heart of the forest, cousins from Missouri, an old Nazi, a beautiful girl with a black Volvo, silent men and tough women, a champion-bicyclist music teacher with a thumb in the middle of his hand\u2014and, not least, on a shiny vinyl disk, the Beatles. <br />The story unfolds in sweltering wood saunas, amidst chain thrashings and gang warfare, learning to play the guitar in the garage, over a traditional wedding meal, on the way to China, during drinking competitions, while learning secret languages, playing ice hockey surrounded by snow drifts, outsmarting mice, discovering girls, staging a first rock concert, peeing in the snow, skiing under a sparkling midnight sky. In the manner of David Mitchell\u2019s Black Swan Green, Mikael Niemi tells a story of a rural Sweden at once foreign and familiar, as a magical childhood slowly fades with the seasons into adult reality.",

He proposes that we look at evolution as a battle between genes instead of between whole organisms. We can then view changes in phenotypes\u2014the end products of genes, like eye color or leaf shape, which are usually considered to increase the fitness of an individual\u2014as serving the evolutionary interests of genes.<br /><br />Dawkins makes a convincing case that considering one\u2019s body, personality, and environment as a field of combat in a kind of \u201carms race\u201d between genes fighting to express themselves on a strand of DNA can clarify and extend the idea of survival of the fittest. This influential and controversial book illuminates the complex world of genetics in an engaging, lively manner.",

    "description": "<i>The Selfish Gene: 30th Anniversary Edition\u2014with a new Introduction by the Author</i><br /><br />Inheriting the mantle of revolutionary biologist from Darwin, Watson, and Crick, Richard Dawkins forced an enormous change in the way we see ourselves and the world with the publication of <i>The Selfish Gene</i>. Suppose, instead of thinking about organisms using genes to reproduce themselves, as we had since Mendel's work was rediscovered, we turn it around and imagine that \"our\" genes build and maintain us in order to make more genes. That simple reversal seems to answer many puzzlers which had stumped scientists for years, and we haven't thought of evolution in the same way since.<br /><br />Why are there miles and miles of \"unused\" DNA within each of our bodies? Why should a bee give up its own chance to reproduce to help raise her sisters and brothers? With a prophet's clarity, Dawkins told us the answers from the perspective of molecules competing for limited space and resources to produce more of their own kind. Drawing fascinating examples from every field of biology, he paved the way for a serious re-evaluation of evolution. He also introduced the concept of self-reproducing ideas, or memes, which (seemingly) use humans exclusively for their propagation. If we are puppets, he says, at least we can try to understand our strings. \u2014Rob Lightner",

    "description": "Voltaire (1694-1778), novelist, dramatist, poet, philosopher, historian, and satirist, was one of the most renowned figures of the Age of Enlightenment. In this collection of anti-clerical works from the last twenty-five years of Voltaire's life, he roundly attacks the philosophical optimism of the deists, the so-called inspiration of the Bible, the papacy, and vulgar superstition. These great works reveal Voltaire not only as a polemicist but also as a profound humanitarian. Selections include \"Poem on the Lisbon Disaster,\" \"We Must Take Sides,\" \"The Questions of Zapate,\" \"The Sermon of the Fifty,\" homilies on superstition and the interpretation of the Old and New Testaments, and his famous \"Treatise on Toleration.\"",

The transformation of state and society, the violent transference of power and property, and the establishment of Augustus' rule are presented in an unconventional narrative, which quotes from ancient evidence, refers seldomly to modern authorities, and states controversial opinions quite openly. The result is a book which is both fresh and compelling.<br />",

That includes going fishing for his own supply of bluefin tuna belly; nearly incinerating his oven in pursuit of the perfect pizza crust, and spending four days boning and stuffing three different fowl\u2014into each other-- to produce the Cajun specialty called \u201cturducken.\u201d <br /><br /><i>It Must\u2019ve Been Something I Ate</i> finds Steingarten testing the virtues of chocolate and gourmet salts; debunking the mythology of lactose intolerance and Chinese Food Syndrome; roasting marrow bones for his dog , and offering recipes for everything from lobster rolls to gratin dauphinois. The result is one of those rare books that are simultaneously mouth-watering and side-splitting.",

Connecting China's heartland cities with the volatile coastal giant, Shanghai, it has also historically connected China to the outside world through its nearly one thousand miles of navigable waters. To travel those waters is to travel back in history, to sense the soul of China, and Simon Winchester takes us along with him as he encounters the essence of China--its history and politics, its geography and climate as well as engage in its culture, and its people in remote and almost inaccessible places. This is travel writing at its best: lively, informative, and thoroughly enchanting.<br />",

    "description": "Satyricon (or Satyrica) is a Latin work of fiction in a mixture of prose &amp; poetry (prosimetrum). It's thought to have been written by Gaius Petronius Arbiter, tho the manuscript tradition identifies the author as a certain Titus Petronius. As with the Metamorphoses of Apuleius, classicists often describe it as a Roman novel, without necessarily implying continuity with the modern literary form. Surviving portions of the text detail the misadventures of the narrator, Encolpius, &amp; his lover, a handsome 16-year-old boy, Giton. Throughout the novel, Encolpius has a hard time keeping his lover faithful to him as he's constantly being enticed away by others. Encolpius's friend Ascyltus (who seems to have previously been in a relationship with Encolpius) is another major character.<br /> It's one of the two most extensive witnesses to the Roman novel, the only other being the fully extant Metamorphoses of Apuleius, which is quite different in style &amp; plot. Satyricon is also important evidence for the reconstruction of what everyday life may have been like for the lower classes during the early Roman Empire.<br /> The text was copied throughout the Middle Ages. In 1664 the 1st critical edition, which included Trimalchio\u2019s party, was put to print, thru the efforts of Pierre Petit.<br /> Satyricon has been translated into several languages &amp; has been one of the bestsellers of Western literature. Because of the status of the extant original texts, the true intent of the novel is unknown. It could be a satire with a moral component or a satyr in revenge for Nero's dismissal of Seneca.",

    "description": "The Gourdification of Claudius the God has instant and lasting appeal. It is a uniquely surviving specimen of prose-and-verse satire from the Roman world - and satire, a Roman speciality, is one of the few types of ancient literature to survive, and thrive, in modern society. Its author, Seneca, was not only gifted with intellectual virtuosity, but, at the time of writing, was the precarious power behind the throne of the dangerously developing Nero. Claudius, the target of his malicious wit, remains the most controversial of the first twelve imperial Caesars. The English version facing the text makes the work available to the general reader who may not have any Latin. The text, which is based on a critical examination of all the manuscripts, will be indispensable to scholars. The commentary, which is the first on this scale to have been written in English, is primarily addressed to university and other students.",

    "description": "It is 1919 and the Great War has come to a close. But in the shadows of the world\u2019s major cities, the killing has just begun. In this perilous time, as the division between order and chaos grows increasingly slim, a select group of visionaries have taken it upon themselves to ensure the safety of humanity. They are known as the Arcanum.<br /><br />In London\u2019s stormy Hyde Park, Konstantin Duvall, the Arcanum\u2019s founder, has been killed in a suspicious accident. Dismayed, the group\u2019s longest-lived member, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, determines to avenge Duvall\u2019s death\u2014and uncover the secret left in his wake. For the dead man possessed the world\u2019s most powerful\u2014now missing\u2014artifact: the Book of Enoch, the chronicle of God\u2019s mistakes, within whose pages lie the seeds for the end of everything. <br /><br />From the scene of the crime, Conan Doyle embarks on a path that leads him to the sleazy underworld of New York City\u2019s Bowery and a series of deceptively disparate\u2014but decidedly connected\u2014murders. And as he calls upon the scattered members of the Arcanum for aid, he also finds himself embroiled in a story of war as old as time itself. Not of a struggle between countries, but between darkness and light.<br />Peopled with the twentieth century\u2019s most famous\u2014and infamous\u2014figures, here is an extraordinary tale in which the stakes go beyond the realm of humankind\u2014into the divine.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "From the Roman Emperor Julian, who waxed rhapsodic about Parisian wine and figs, to Henry Miller, who relished its seductive bohemia, Paris has been a perennial source of fascination for 2,000 years. In this definitive and illuminating history, Colin Jones walks us through the city that was a plague-infested charnel house during the Middle Ages, the bloody epicenter of the French Revolution, the muse of nineteenth-century Impressionist painters, and much more. Jones\u2019s masterful narrative is enhanced by numerous photographs and feature boxes\u2014on the Bastille or Josephine Baker, for instance\u2014that complete a colorful and comprehensive portrait of a place that has endured Vikings, Black Death, and the Nazis to emerge as the heart of a resurgent Europe. This is a thrilling companion for history buffs and backpack, or armchair, travelers alike.",

    "description": "A modern classic of Jewish-American literature, a remarkable journey into the shrouded world of Chassidic women. Naomi Ragen's first novel has been called \"one of the too most important Jewish books.\" Abraham Ha-Levi is a wealthy American businessman and the last male survivor of an important Orthodox Jewish family. He decides it's time he finally honored his religious and cultural inheritance and so forces his 18-year old daughter--the beautiful and intelligent Batsheva--into an arranged marriage. Her new husband is a devout Torah scholar who lives in Jerusalem. Batsheva finds herself plunged into a new life and a strange land, among people who follow their religious laws to the letter. Then she realizes that her husband's piety is merely a mask for his cruelty. A magnificent book that builds up momentum compellingly.",

    "description": "<strong></strong>A groundbreaking work of science that confirms, for the first time, the independent existence of the mind\u2013and demonstrates the possibilities for human control over the workings of the brain.<br /><br />Conventional science has long held the position that 'the mind' is merely an illusion, a side effect of electrochemical activity in the physical brain. Now in paperback, Dr Jeffrey Schwartz and Sharon Begley's groundbreaking work, <em>The Mind and the Brain</em>, argues exactly the opposite: that the mind has a life of its own.Dr Schwartz, a leading researcher in brain dysfunctions, and Wall Street Journal science columnist Sharon Begley demonstrate that the human mind is an independent entity that can shape and control the functioning of the physical brain. Their work has its basis in our emerging understanding of adult neuroplasticity\u2013the brain's ability to be rewired not just in childhood, but throughout life, a trait only recently established by neuroscientists.<br /><br />Through decades of work treating patients with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD), Schwartz made an extraordinary finding: while following the therapy he developed, his patients were effecting significant and lasting changes in their own neural pathways. It was a scientific first: by actively focusing their attention away from negative behaviors and toward more positive ones, Schwartz's patients were using their minds to reshape their brains\u2013and discovering a thrilling new dimension to the concept of neuroplasticity.<br /><br /><em>The Mind and the Brain</em> follows Schwartz as he investigates this newly discovered power, which he calls self\u2013directed neuroplasticity or, more simply, mental force. It describes his work with noted physicist Henry Stapp and connects the concept of 'mental force' with the ancient practice of mindfulness in Buddhist tradition. And it points to potential new applications that could transform the treatment of almost every variety of neurological dysfunction, from dyslexia to stroke\u2013and could lead to new strategies to help us harness our mental powers. Yet as wondrous as these implications are, perhaps even more important is the philosophical dimension of Schwartz's work. For the existence of mental force offers convincing scientific evidence of human free will, and thus of man's inherent capacity for moral choice.",

Near the body, police have found a baffling cipher. While working to solve the enigmatic riddle, Langdon is stunned to discover it leads to a trail of clues hidden in the works of Da Vinci -- clues visible for all to see -- yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.<p>Langdon joins forces with a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, and learns the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion -- an actual secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci, among others.</p><p>In a breathless race through Paris, London, and beyond, Langdon and Neveu match wits with a faceless powerbroker who seems to anticipate their every move. Unless Langdon and Neveu can deipher the labyrinthine puzzle in time, the Priory's ancient secret -- and an explosive historical truth -- will be lost forever.</p><p><i>This book has Alternate Cover Editions for this ISBN [ACE]</i><br /><b><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24341336\" rel=\"nofollow\">ACE #1</a></b> (Gold lettering, textured cover)</p>",

    "description": "Four sisters, a Manhattan brownstone, and a tumultuous year of loss and courage are at the heart of Danielle Steel\u2019s new novel about a remarkable family, a stunning tragedy\u2014and what happens when four very different young women come together under one very lively roof.<br /><br /> Candy\u2013it\u2019s the only name she needs\u2014is blazing her way through Paris, New York, and Tokyo as fashion\u2019s latest international supermodel. . . . <br /><br /> Her sister Tammy has a job producing the most successful hit show on TV, and a home she loves in L.A.\u2019s Hollywood Hills. . . . In New York, oldest sister Sabrina is an ambitious young lawyer, while Annie is an American artist in Florence, living for her art. . . . On one Fourth of July weekend, as they do every year, the four sisters come home to Connecticut for their family\u2019s annual gathering. But before the holiday is over, tragedy strikes and their world is utterly changed.<br /><br /> Suddenly, four sisters who have been fervently pursuing success and their own lives\u2014on opposite sides of the world\u2014reunite to share one New York brownstone, to support each other and their father, and to pick up the pieces while one sister struggles to heal her shattered body and soul. Thus begins an unscripted chapter of their lives, as a bustling house is soon filled with eccentric dogs, laughter, tears, friends, men . . . and the kind of honesty and unconditional love only sisters can provide. But as the four women settle in, they are forced to confront the direction of their respective lives. As the year passes and another July Fourth approaches, a season of grief and change gives way to new beginnings\u2014as a family comes together to share its blessings and a future filled with surprises and, ultimately, hope.<br /><br /> With unerring insight and compassion, Danielle Steel tells a compelling story of four sisters who love and laugh, struggle and triumph . . . and are irrevocably woven into the fabric of each other\u2019s lives. Brilliantly blending humor and heartbreak, she delivers a powerful message about the fragility\u2014and the wonder\u2014of life.",

    "description": "The idea for <b>Dropped Threads: What We Aren't Told</b> came up between Carol Shields and longtime friend Marjorie Anderson over lunch. It appeared that after decades of feminism, the \u201cwomen's network\u201d still wasn't able to prevent women being caught off-guard by life. There remained subjects women just didn't talk about, or felt they couldn't talk about. Holes existed in the fabric of women's discourse, and they needed examining.<br /><br />They asked thirty-four women to write about moments in life that had taken them by surprise or experiences that received too little discussion, and then they compiled these pieces into a book. It became an instant number one bestseller, a book clubs' favourite and a runaway success. <b>Dropped Threads</b>, says Anderson, \"tapped into a powerful need to share personal stories about life's defining moments of surprise and silence.\" Readers recognized themselves in these honest and intimate stories; there was something universal in these deeply personal accounts. Other stories and suggestions poured in. <b>Dropped Threads</b> would clearly be an ongoing project.<br /><br />Like the first volume, <b>Dropped Threads 2</b><i> </i>features stories by well-known novelists and journalists such as Jane Urquhart, Susan Swan and Shelagh Rogers, but also many excellent new writers including teachers, mothers, a civil servant, a therapist. This triumphant follow-up received a starred first review in <i>Quill and Quire </i>magazine, which called it \u201ccompassionate and unflinching.\u201d The book deals with such difficult topics as loss, depression, disease, widowhood, violence, and coming to terms with death. Several stories address some of the darker sides of motherhood:<br /><br />- A mother describes how, while sleep-deprived and in a miserable marriage, she is shocked to find infanticide crossing her mind.<br />- Another woman recounts a memory of her alcoholic mother demanding the children prove their loyalty in a terrifying way.<br />- A woman desperate for children refers to the bleak truth as: \"Another Christmas of feeling barren.\" Narrating the fertility treatment she undergoes, the hopes dashed, she is amusing in retrospect and yet brutally honest.<br /><br />While they deal with loss and trauma, the pieces show the path to some kind of acceptance, showing the authors\u2019 determination to learn from pain and pass on the wisdom gained. The volume also covers the rewards of learning to be a parent, choosing to remain single, or fitting in as a lesbian parent. It explores how women feel when something is missing in a friendship, how they experience discrimination, relationship challenges, and other emotions less easily defined but just as close to the bone:<br /><br />- Alison Wearing in \u201cMy Life as a Shadow\u201d subtly describes allowing her personality to be subsumed by her boyfriend's.<br />- Pamela Mala Sinha tells how, after suffering a brutal attack, she felt self-hatred and a longing for retribution.<br />- Dana McNairn talks of her uncomfortable marriage to a man from a different social background: \"I wanted to fit in with this strange, wondrous family who never raised their voices, never swore and never threw things at one another.\"<br /><br />Humour, a confiding tone, and beautiful writing elevate and enliven even the darkest stories. Details bring scenes vividly to life, so we feel we are in the room with Barbara Defago when the doctor tells her she has breast cancer, coolly dividing her life into a 'before and after.' Lucid, reflective and poignant, <b>Dropped Threads 2</b> is for anyone interested in women's true stories.",

    "description": "<i>I am convinced that at birth the cake is already baked. Nurture is the nuts or frosting, but if you\u2019re a spice cake, you\u2019re a spice cake, and nothing is going to change you into an angel food.</i><br /><br />Tall, slender Violet Mathers is growing up in the Great Depression, which could just as well define her state of mind. Abandoned by her mother as a child, mistreated by her father, and teased by her schoolmates (\u201cHey, Olive Oyl, where\u2019s Popeye?\u201d), the lonely girl finds solace in artistic pursuits. Only when she\u2019s hired by the town\u2019s sole feminist to work the night shift in the local thread factory does Violet come into her name, and bloom. Accepted by her co-workers, the teenager enters the happiest phase of her life, until a terrible accident causes her to retreat once again into her lonely shell.<br /><br />Realizing that she has only one clear choice, Violet boards a bus heading west to California. But when the bus crashes in North Dakota, it seems that fate is having another cruel laugh at Violet\u2019s expense. This time though, Violet laughs back. She and her fellow passengers are rescued by two men: Austin Sykes, whom Violet is certain is the blackest man to ever set foot on the North Dakota prairie, and Kjel Hedstrom, who inspires feelings Violet never before has felt. Kjel and Austin are musicians whose sound is like no other, and with pluck, verve, and wit, Violet becomes part of their quest to make a new kind of music together. <br /><br /><i>Oh My Stars</i> is Lorna Landvik\u2019s most ambitious novel yet, with a cast of characters whose travails and triumphs you\u2019ll long remember. It is a tale of love and hope, bigotry and betrayal, loss and discovery\u2013as Violet, who\u2019s always considered herself a minor character in her own life story, emerges as a heroine you\u2019ll laugh with, cry with, and, most important, cheer for all the way.",

    "description": "A lively history of the contested landscapes where the majority of Americans now live, <i>Building Suburbia </i>chronicles two centuries in the birth and development of America\u2019s metropolitan regions.<br /><br />From rustic cottages reached by steamboat to big box stores at the exit ramps of eight-lane highways, Dolores Hayden defines seven eras of suburban development since 1820. An urban historian and architect, she portrays housewives and politicians as well as designers and builders making the decisions that have generated America\u2019s diverse suburbs. Residents have sought home, nature, and community in suburbia. Developers have cherished different dreams, seeking profit from economies of scale and increased suburban densities, while lobbying local and federal government to reduce the risk of real estate speculation. Encompassing environmental controversies as well as the complexities of race, gender, and class, Hayden\u2019s fascinating account will forever alter how we think about the communities we build and inhabit.",

    "description": "<b>Now with more than three million copies sold, Oscar-winning filmmaker and political activist Michael Moore's bestseller<i> Stupid White Men</i> tells you everything you need to know about how the great and the good screw us over.</b><br /><br />It reveals - among other things - how 'President' Bush stole an election aided only by his brother, cousin and dad's cronies, electoral fraud and tame judges; how the rich stay rich while forcing the rest of us to live in economic fear; and how politicians have whored themselves to big business.<br /><br />Whether he's calling for United Nations action to overthrow the Bush Family Junta, calling on African-Americans to place whites-only signs over the entrances of unfriendly businesses, or praying that Jesse Helms will get kissed by a man, <i>Stupid White Men</i> is Michael Moore's Manifesto on Malfeasance and Mediocrity.<br /><br />A hilarious must-read for anyone who wants to know what the con is and how 'they' get away with it, <i>Stupid White Men</i> is only available uncensored because public pressure forced the original publishers to publish a book they felt was too hot to handle. Now it's time to find out why.<br /><br />'A really great, hilarious, rollicking, fantastic read'<br />\u00a0\u00a0<i>Newsnight Review</i><br /><br />'Caustic, breakneck, tell-it-like-it-is ...

(She realizes that she'd be far less confused had she given them different names, like Marvin O'Gravel Balloon Face or Zanzibar Buck-Buck McFate.)<br /><br />WHAT WAS I SCARED OF?<br />A slightly spooky adventure involving a pair of haunted trousers--\"What was I scared of?\"--closes out the collection. Sneetches and Other Stories is Seuss at his best, with distinctively wacky illustrations and ingeniously weird prose. (Ages 4 to 8) --Paul Hughes",

    "description": "From beloved international reporter \u00c5sne Seierstad comes a remarkable exploration of the lives of ordinary Serbs under the regime of Slobodan Milosevic-during the dramatic events leading up to his fall, and finally in the troubled years that have followed. Seierstad traveled extensively through Serbia between 1999 and 2004, following the lives of people from across the political spectrum. Her moving and perceptive account follows nationalists, Titoists, Yugonostalgics, rock stars, fugitives, and poets. Seierstad brings her acclaimed attention to detail to bear on the lives of those whom she encounters in <i>With Their Backs to the World</i>, as she creates a kaleidoscopic portrait of a nation made up of so many different-and often conflicting-hopes, dreams, and points of view.",

    "description": "<br />When it comes to reporting on politics, nobody does it smarter or funnier than bestselling author Molly Ivins. In Shrub, Ivins focuses her Texas-size smarts on the biggest politician in her home state: George Walker Bush, or \"Shrub,\" as Ivins has nicknamed Bush the Younger.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br />A candidate of vague speeches and an ambiguous platform, Bush leads the pack of GOP 2000 presidential hopefuls; \"Dubya\" could very well be our next president. What voters need now is an original, smart, and accessible analysis of Bush--one that leaves the \"youthful indiscretions\" to the tabloids and gets to the heart of his policies and motivations. Ivins is the perfect woman for the job.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br />With her trademark wit and down-home wisdom, Molly Ivins shares three pieces of advice on judging a politician: \"The first is to look at the record. The second is to look at the record. And third, look at the record.\" In this book, Ivins takes a good, hard look at the record of the man who could be the leader of the free world. Beginning with his post-college military career, Ivins tracks Dubya's winding, sometimes unlikely path from a failed congressional bid to a two-term governorship. Bush has made plenty of friends and supporters along the way, including Texas oil barons, evangelist Billy Graham, and co-investors in the Texas Rangers baseball team. \"You would have to work at it to dislike the man,\" she writes. But for all of Bush's likeability, Ivins points to a disconcerting lack of political passion from this ascending presidential candidate. In her words, \"If you think his daddy had trouble with 'the vision thing,' wait till you meet this one.\"<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br />Witty, trenchant, and on target, Ivins gives a singularly perceptive and entertaining analysis of George W. Bush. To head to the voting booth without it would be downright un-American.<br /><br /><b>From Shrub: The Short but Happy Political Life of George W. Bush</b><br /><br />\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The past is prologue in politics. If a politician is left, right, weak, strong, given to the waffle or the flip-flop, or, as sometimes happens, an able soul who performs well under pressure, all that will be in the record.\"<br /><br />\u00a0\u00b8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<b>Bush's welfare record:</b> \"Texas pols like to 'git tuff' on crime, welfare, commies, and other bad stuff. Bush proposed to git tuff on welfare recipients by ending the allowance for each additional child--which in Texas is $38 a month.\"<br /><br />\u00a0\u00b8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<b>Bush and the Christian right:</b> \"Bush has learned to dance with the Christian right. It has been interesting and amusing to watch the process. Interesting because it's sometimes hard to tell who's leading and who's following; amusing because when a scion of Old Yankee money gets together with a televangelist with too much Elvis, the result is swell entertainment.\"<br /><br />\u00a0\u00b8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<b>Bush's environmental record:</b> Since Governor Bush's election, Texas air quality has been rated the worst in the nation, leading all fifty states in overall toxic releases, recognized carcinogens in the air, cancer risk, and ten other categories of pollutants.<br /><br />\u00a0\u00b8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<b>Bush's military career:</b> \"Bush was promoted as the Texas Air National Guard's anti-drug poster boy, one of life's little ironies given the difficulty he has had answering cocaine questions all these years later. 'George Walker Bush is one member of the younger generation who doesn't get his kicks from pot or hashish or speed,' reads a Guard press release of 1970. 'Oh, he gets high, all right, but not from narcotics.'\"<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

Babbitt, a 46- year-old real estate broker, enjoys all the modern conveniences available to a prosperous middle-class businessman, yet he is dissatisfied with his life. When the novel opens, Babbitt has begun to regularly indulge in fantasies about a fairy girl who makes him feel like a gallant youth.<br /><br />Babbitt's closest friend Paul Riesling is even more dissatisfied with his life. He is also more vocal about it. Riesling and Babbitt try to ameliorate their dissatisfaction by taking a vacation in Maine together, but their enjoyment at their newfound freedom is short-lived. They eventually have to return to their lives as middle-aged married men. Both men experience a growing impulse to rebel against social conventions.",

    "description": "In 1904, New York nuns brought forty Irish orphans to a remote Arizona mining camp, to be placed with Catholic families. The Catholic families were Mexican, as was the majority of the population. Soon the town's Anglos, furious at this \"interracial\" transgression, formed a vigilante squad that kidnapped the children and nearly lynched the nuns and the local priest. The Catholic Church sued to get its wards back, but all the courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, ruled in favor of the vigilantes.<br /><br /><i>The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction</i> tells this disturbing and dramatic tale to illuminate the creation of racial boundaries along the Mexican border. Clifton/Morenci, Arizona, was a \"wild West\" boomtown, where the mines and smelters pulled in thousands of Mexican immigrant workers. Racial walls hardened as the mines became big business and whiteness became a marker of superiority. These already volatile race and class relations produced passions that erupted in the \"orphan incident.\" To the Anglos of Clifton/Morenci, placing a white child with a Mexican family was tantamount to child abuse, and they saw their kidnapping as a rescue.<br /><br />Women initiated both sides of this confrontation. Mexican women agreed to take in these orphans, both serving their church and asserting a maternal prerogative; Anglo women believed they had to \"save\" the orphans, and they organized a vigilante squad to do it. In retelling this nearly forgotten piece of American history, Linda Gordon brilliantly recreates and dissects the tangled intersection of family and racial values, in a gripping story that resonates with today's conflicts over the \"best interests of the child.\"",

So <b>Sinclair Lewis</b>, recipient of the Nobel Prize and rejecter of the Pulitzer, prefaces his novel <i>Main Street</i>. Lewis is brutal in his depictions of the self-satisfied inhabitants of small-town America, a place which proves to be merely an assemblage of pretty surfaces, strung together and ultimately empty.",

It is the story of Dave Pelzer, who was brutally beaten and starved by his emotionally unstable, alcoholic mother: a mother who played tortuous, unpredictable games\u2014games that left him nearly dead. He had to learn how to play his mother's games in order to survive because she no longer considered him a son, but a slave; and no longer a boy, but an \"it.\" Dave's bed was an old army cot in the basement, and his clothes were torn and raunchy. When his mother allowed him the luxury of food, it was nothing more than spoiled scraps that even the dogs refused to eat. The outside world knew nothing of his living nightmare. He had nothing or no one to turn to, but his dreams kept him alive\u2014dreams of someone taking care of him, loving him and calling him their son.",

    "description": "Tom Perrotta's thirtyish parents of young children are a varied and surprising bunch. There's Todd, the handsome stay-at-home dad dubbed \"The Prom King\" by the moms at the playground, and his wife, Kathy, a documentary filmmaker envious of the connection Todd has forged with their toddler son. And <br />there's Sarah, a lapsed feminist surprised to find she's become a typical wife in a traditional marriage, and her husband, Richard, who is becoming more and more involved with an internet fantasy life than with his own wife and child. <br />And then there's Mary Ann, who has life all figured out, down to a scheduled roll in the hay with her husband every Tuesday at nine P.M.<br /><br /><p>They all raise their kids in the kind of quiet suburb where nothing ever seems to happen - until one eventful summer, when a convicted child molester moves back to town, and two parents begin an affair that goes further than either of them could ever have imagined.</p>",

Over five years, business professor Pietra Rivoli traveled from a Texas cotton field to a Chinese factory to a used clothing market in Africa, to investigate compelling questions about the politics, economics, ethics, and history of modern business and globalization. Using the story of the t-shirt to illustrate the major issues of the globalization debate, this uniquely entertaining business book offers a surprising, enlightening, and balanced look at one of the major topics of our time. It has won the prize or award - Business Book of the Year 2005, Finalist; AAP Awards for Excellence in Professional and Scholarly Publishing, 2006.",

    "description": "In 1855 Walt Whitman published <b>Leaves of Grass</b>, the work that defined him as one of America\u2019s most influential voices and that he added to throughout his life. A collection of astonishing originality and intensity, it spoke of politics, sexual emancipation, and what it meant to be an American. From the joyful \u201cSong of Myself\u201d and \u201cI Sing the Body Electric\u201d to the elegiac \u201cWhen Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom\u2019d,\u201d Whitman\u2019s art fuses oratory, journalism, and song in a vivid celebration of humanity. Containing all Whitman\u2019s known poetic work, this edition reprints the final, or \u201cdeathbed,\u201d edition of Leaves of Grass (1891\u201392). Earlier versions of many poems are also given, including the 1855 \u201cSong of Myself.\u201d<br />Features a completely new\u2014and fuller\u2014introduction discussing the development of Whitman's poetic career, his influence on later American poets, and his impact on the American cultural sensibility<br /><br /><br />Includes chronology, updated suggestions for further reading, and extensive notes",

    "description": "Revisit the second memoir in Augusten's bestselling trilogy of <i>Running with Scissors, Dry,</i> and <i>Lust &amp; Wonder</i>. <br /><br />You may not know it, but you've met Augusten Burroughs. You've seen him on the street, in bars, on the subway, at restaurants: a twenty-something guy, nice suit, works in advertising. Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had two drinks, Augusten was circling the drain by having twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. Loud, distracting ties, automated wake-up calls, and cologne on the tongue could only hide so much for so long. At the request (well, it wasn't really a request) of his employers, Augusten landed in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey, Jr., are immediately dashed by the grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers. But when Augusten is forced to examine himself, something actually starts to click, and that's when he finds himself in the worst trouble of all. Because when his thirty days are up, he has to return to his same drunken Manhattan life and live it sober. What follows is a memoir that's as moving as it is funny, as heartbreaking as it is real. <i>Dry</i> is the story of love, loss, and Starbucks as a higher power.",

    "description": "Anyone alive in the eighteenth century would have known that \"the longitude problem\" was the thorniest scientific dilemma of the day\u2014and had been for centuries. Lacking the ability to measure their longitude, sailors throughout the great ages of exploration had been literally lost at sea as soon as they lost sight of land. Thousands of lives, and the increasing fortunes of nations, hung on a resolution.<br /><br />The scientific establishment of Europe\u2014from Galileo to Sir Issac Newton\u2014had mapped the heavens in both hemispheres in its certain pursuit of a celestial answer. In stark contrast, one man, John Harrison, dared to imagine a mechanical solution\u2014a clock that would keep precise time at sea, something no clock had ever been able to do on land. <em>Longitude</em> is a dramatic human story of an epic scientific quest and Harrison's forty-year obsession with building his perfect timekeeper, known today as the chronometer. Full of heroism and chicanery, it is also a fascinating brief history of astronomy, navigation, and clock-making, and opens a new window on our world.<br /><br />On its 10th anniversary, a gift edition of this classic book, with a forward by one of history's greatest explorers, and eight pages of color illustrations.",

    "description": "As a child, Elias Chacour lived in a small Palestinian village in Galilee. The townspeople were proud of their ancient Christian heritage and lived at peace with their Jewish neighbors. But early in 1947, their idyllic lifestyle was swept away as tens of thousands of Palestinians were killed and nearly one million forced into refugee camps. <br />\tAn exile in his native land, Elias began a years-long struggle with his love for the Jewish people and the world's misunderstanding of his own people, the Palestinians. How was he to respond? He found his answer in the simple, haunting words of the Man of Galilee: \"Blessed are the peacemakers.\" <br />\tIn Blood Brothers, Chacour blends his riveting life story with historical research to reveal a little-known side of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the birth of modern Israel. He touches on controversial questions such as \"What behind-the-scenes politics touched off the turmoil in the Middle East?,\" \"What does Bible prophecy really have to say?,\" and \"Can bitter enemies ever be reconciled?\"<br />\tOriginally published by Chosen Books in 1984 and now expanded with a new introduction by the author, a new foreword by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, and a \"Since Then\" epilogue by writer David Hazard, this compelling book offers readers hope-filled insight into living at peace in the most volatile region of the world.",

The night-long wait for morning and death provides <i>Dawn</i>, Elie Wiesel's ever more timely novel, with its harrowingly taut, hour-by-hour narrative. Caught between the manifold horrors of the past and the troubling dilemmas of the present, Elisha wrestles with guilt, ghosts, and ultimately God as he waits for the appointed hour and his act of assassination. <i>Dawn</i> is an eloquent meditation on the compromises, justifications, and sacrifices that human beings make when they murder other human beings.",

    "description": "\"It's not what you have but what you do with it that counts.\" This is the story of how that philosophy worked out in the life of Penny Buford, an ordinary housewife who leaves an extraordinary legacy.<br /><br />Yandell's Small Change is about a devoted housewife, Penny Burford, who scoops up her husband Roy's loose change and eventually puts together a substantial bank account. She uses the money for secret charities, of which the phlegmatic Roy learns only upon Penny's death. Why Penny did what she did the way she did it then becomes the story, and the reader must return to Roy and Penny's childhoods to understand it fully. Yandell is sentimental but not syrupy: Roy and Penny's marriage is realistically drawn, and the points she makes about the nature of charity are well taken.<br /><br />John Mort<br />Copyright American Library Association",

    "description": "<i>Cannery Row</i> is a book without much of a plot. Rather, it is an attempt to capture the feeling and people of a place, the cannery district of Monterey, California, which is populated by a mix of those down on their luck and those who choose for other reasons not to live \"up the hill\" in the more respectable area of town. The flow of the main plot is frequently interrupted by short vignettes that introduce us to various denizens of the Row, most of whom are not directly connected with the central story. These vignettes are often characterized by direct or indirect reference to extreme violence: suicides, corpses, and the cruelty of the natural world.<br /><br />The \"story\" of <i>Cannery Row</i> follows the adventures of Mack and the boys, a group of unemployed yet resourceful men who inhabit a converted fish-meal shack on the edge of a vacant lot down on the Row.<br /><br />Sweet Thursday is the sequel to Cannery Row.",

    "description": "<strong><em>New York Times</em>\u00a0Bestseller</strong><br /><br /><em>The project that captured a nation's imagination.</em><br /><br />The instructions were simple, but the results were extraordinary.<br /><br />You are invited to anonymously contribute a secret to a group art project. Your secret can be a regret, fear, betrayal, desire, confession, or childhood humiliation. Reveal <em>anything</em> -- as long as it is true and you have never shared it with anyone before. Be brief. Be legible. Be creative.<br /><br />It all began with an idea Frank Warren had for a community art project. He began handing out postcards to strangers and leaving them in public places -- asking people to write down a secret they had never told anyone and mail it to him, anonymously.<br /><br />The response was overwhelming. The secrets were both provocative and profound, and the cards themselves were works of art -- carefully and creatively constructed by hand. Addictively compelling, the cards reveal our deepest fears, desires, regrets, and obsessions. Frank calls them \"graphic haiku,\" beautiful, elegant, and small in structure but powerfully emotional.<br /><br />As Frank began posting the cards on his website, PostSecret took on a life of its own, becoming much more than a simple art project. It has grown into a global phenomenon, exposing our individual aspirations, fantasies, and frailties -- our common humanity.<br /><br />Every day dozens of postcards still make their way to Frank, with postmarks from around the world, touching on every aspect of human experience. This extraordinary collection brings together the most powerful, personal, and beautifully intimate secrets Frank Warren has received -- and brilliantly illuminates that human emotions can be unique and universal at the same time.",

    "description": "On an island off the coasts of Virginia and Maryland lives a centuries-old band of wild ponies. Among them is the most mysterious of all, Phantom, a rarely seen mare that eludes all efforts to capture her--that is, until a young boy and girl lay eyes on her and determine that they can't live without her. The frenzied roundup that follows on the next \"Pony Penning Day\" does indeed bring Phantom into their lives, in a way they never would have suspected. Phantom would forever be a creature of the wild. But her gentle, loyal colt Misty is another story altogether.",

    "description": "In the winter of 2002, <em>Stupid White Men</em> took America -- and the world -- by storm. Tired and skeptical of George W. Bush's high approval ating, frightened by the implications of the Enron scandal -- and generally just looking for a voice of honest dissent in the thick atmosphere of jingoism that followed 9/11 -- book buyers from coast to coast swiftly embraced Michael Moore's in-your-face anti-Bush-era manifesto, making it one of the bestselling nonfiction books of the year.<br /><br />With an unerring eye for greed, hypocrisy, and corruption, Michael Moore takes on the whole ugly mess of America at the dawn of the twenty-first century. Whether he's demanding U.N. action to overthrow the Bush Family Junta or calling on African Americans to place whites only signs over the entrances of unfriendly businesses, <em>Stupid White Men</em> is a pitch-perfect skewering of our culture of Malfeasance and Mediocrity.",

    "description": "Thailand\u2019s Bhumibol Adulyadej, the only king ever born in the United States, came to the throne of his country in 1946 and at the time of his death, in October 2016, was the world\u2019s longest serving monarch. <i>The King Never Smiles</i>, the first independent biography of Thailand's monarch,\u00a0tells the unexpected story of\u00a0Bhumibol's life and sixty-year rule\u2014how a Western-raised boy came to be seen by his people as a living Buddha, and how a king widely seen as beneficent and apolitical could in fact be so deeply political and\u00a0autocratic.<br /><br /> Paul Handley provides an extensively researched, factual account of the king\u2019s youth and personal development, ascent to the throne, skillful political maneuverings, and attempt to shape Thailand as a Buddhist kingdom.\u00a0Handley takes full note of Bhumibol's achievements in art, in sports and jazz, and he credits the king's lifelong dedication to rural development and the livelihoods of his poorest subjects. But, looking beyond\u00a0the widely accepted image of the king as egalitarian and virtuous, Handley portrays an anti-democratic monarch who, together with allies in big business and the corrupt Thai military, has protected a centuries-old, barely modified feudal dynasty.<br /><br /> When at nineteen Bhumibol assumed the throne, the Thai monarchy had been stripped of power and prestige. Over the ensuing decades, Bhumibol became the paramount political actor in the kingdom, silencing critics while\u00a0winning the hearts and minds\u00a0of his people. The book details this process and depicts Thailand\u2019s unique constitutional monarch\u2014his life, his thinking, and his ruling philosophy.",

    "description": "Combining the early, straightforward seductions of Norwegian Wood and the complex mysteries of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, this new novel -- his seventh translated into English -- is Haruki Murakami at his most satisfying and representative best. The scenario is as simple as it is uncomfortable: A male college student falls, and for years remains, in love with a woman whose devotion to Kerouac and an untidy writerly life precludes any personal commitments -- until she meets a considerably older and far more sophisticated businesswoman. It is through this wormhole that she enters Murakami's surreal yet humane universe, to which she serves as guide both for us and the man (now a teacher) who loves her. In the course of her travels from parochial Japan through Europe and ultimately to an island off the coast of Greece, she disappears without trace, leaving only lineaments of her fate: computer accounts of bizarre events and of stories within stories. The teacher, now summoned to assist in the search, experiences his own ominous, haunting visions, which lead him nowhere but home to Japan -- where, under the expanse of deep space and the still-orbiting Sputnik, he finally achieves a true understanding of his beloved. A love story, a missing-person story, a detective story -- all enveloped in a philosophical mystery -- and, finally, a profound meditation on human longing.",

He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility.<br /><br />All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley - a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry\u2019s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn\u2019t had a birthday party in eleven years.<br /><br />But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry - and anyone who reads about him - will find unforgettable.<br /><br />For it\u2019s there that he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic in everything from classes to meals, but a great destiny that\u2019s been waiting for him\u2026if Harry can survive the encounter.<br />(front flap)",

    "description": "Dear Reader,<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that the book you are holding in your hands is extremely unpleasant. It tells an unhappy tale about three very unlucky children. Even though they are charming and clever, the Baudelaire siblings lead lives filled with misery and woe. From the very first page of this book when the children are at the beach and receive terrible news, continuing on through the entire story, disaster lurks at their heels. One might say they are magnets for misfortune.<br /><br />In this short book alone, the three youngsters encounter a greedy and repulsive villain, itchy clothing, a disastrous fire, a plot to steal their fortune, and cold porridge for breakfast.<br /><br />It is my sad duty to write down these unpleasant tales, but there is nothing stopping you from putting this book down at once and reading something happy, if you prefer that sort of thing.<br /><br />With all due respect,<br /><i>Lemony Snicket</i>",

With these, and a set of false papers, she has slipped out of the ghetto, passing as the wife of a Polish officer, until one day an informer spots her on the street and drags her off to the Gestapo. At times a dark lament, at others a sly and sardonic thriller, The Beautiful Mrs. Seidenman is the story of the thirty-six hours that follow Irma's arrest and the events that lead to her dramatic rescue as the last of Warsaw's Jews are about to meet their deaths in the burning ghetto.",

The series features line-by-line commentaries and textual notes on the plays and poems and an extensive introduction. The Winter's Tale is one of Shakespeare's most varied, theatrically self-conscious, and emotionally wide-ranging plays. Much of the play's copiousness inheres in its generic intermingling of tragedy, comedy, romance, pastoral, and the history play. In addition to dates and sources, the introduction attends to iterative patterns, the nature and cause of Leontes' jealousy, the staging and meaning of the bear episode, and the thematic and structural implications of the figure of Time. Special attention is paid to the ending and its tempered happiness. Performance history is integrated throughout the introduction and commentary. Appendices include the theatrical practice of doubling.",

    "description": "Famously referred to as one of the \"Axis of Evil\" countries, North Korea remains one of the most secretive and mysterious nations in the world today. In early 2001 cartoonist Guy Delisle became one of the few Westerners to be allowed access to the fortress-like country. While living in the nation's capital for two months on a work visa for a French film animation company, Delisle observed what he was allowed to see of the culture and lives of the few North Koreans he encountered; his findings form the basis of this graphic novel.<br /><br />Guy Delisle was born in Quebec City in 1966 and has spent the last decade living and working in the South of France with his wife and son. Delisle has spent ten years, mostly in Europe, working in animation, an experience that taught him about movement and drawing. He is now currently focusing on his cartooning. Delisle has written and drawn six graphic novels, including \"Pyongyang,\" his first graphic novel in English.",

Her mother abandoned her before her first birthday and her father, a small-time crook, was in jail more time than he was out. Raised by her flaky and slightly felonious grandmother, Amy worked hard and managed to get scholarships to boarding school, then Harvard, then the Columbia School of Journalism. But now -- a few years into her stint as a reporter for a prestigious magazine -- she doesn't know who she is or how to connect with the world. Seeking answers, she sets out to find the mother she never knew...and maybe a place to belong.",

Leaving her hometown of Eden, Ohio, for the first time, she's heading to London to study drama. Together with fellow students Imogene (a born-again Laura Ashley poster child and frustrated virgin) and Robbie (a native New Yorker, budding bohemian, and very much not a virgin), Evie's flung into a thrilling new world: a world illuminated by the glamorous, outrageous Robbie. Together, anything's possible.<p><br />But then life, and love, intervene. And everything changes.</p><p><br />Fifteen years later, Evie's a single mother teaching drama to night students and living with the eccentric Bunny in her house of artistic renters. Robbie's gone now, killed in a car accident. And Evie's doing her best to forget the past, as well as the dreams they once both shared.</p><p><br />Then an old friendship comes back to haunt Evie. Literally. And suddenly everything is about to change again.</p>",

    "description": "On the evening of June 1, 2001, during an intimate gathering of Nepal's royal family, Crown Prince Dipendra opened fire with automatic weapons inside Kathmandu's royal palace, killing his parents -- the king and queen -- his siblings, five other close relatives, and ultimately himself. It was the bloodiest, most complete massacre of any royal family ever recorded and the most horrifying event in the history of the Shah Dynasty, which had ruled Nepal over 10 generations. The Shah Dynasty continues to rule Nepal -- the Crown Prince's uncle now wears the king's plumed crown -- but Dipendra's violent act has put the tiny mountain nation into a precarious position, where ancient customs and traditions contend with steadily encroaching modernity and Maoist insurgents threaten full-blown civil war. What led privileged young man like Dipendra to an act of such senseless and terrible violence? Drawing on exclusive interviews with the late King Birenda and surviving members of the Shah family, and with unparalleled access to the royal palace, journalist Jonathan Gregson pulls back a veil of secrecy and intrigue to expose a family struggling to bridge the gulf between ancient family traditions and contemporary mores, between the mysteries of a feudal past and the dark pressures of the modern world.<br /><br />Chronicling both the blood-soaked history of Nepal's royal family and its explosive present, Massacre at the Palace offers a rare and comprehensive examination of the inner workings of a family apparently doomed from its beginning to tragedy and loss. Skillfully merging the epic turbulence of Nepal's past with an intimate knowledge of the current state of the court, Gregson offers a riveting account of the birth of the Kingdom of Nepal, and the role of its semi-divine monarchy, and what this means to ordinary Nepalese people. All of these, Gregson writes, had a direct bearing on what was to happen on that fateful night: a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions played out on a modern stage.",

Two years after their twin daughters died in a flash flood, Terry and Laura Sheldon, a Vermont state trooper and his wife, take in a foster child. His name is Alfred; he is ten years old and African American. And he has passed through so many indifferent families that he can\u2019t believe that his new one will last. <br /><br />In the ensuing months Terry and Laura will struggle to emerge from their shell of grief only to face an unexpected threat to their marriage; Terry\u2019s involvement with another woman. Meanwhile, Alfred cautiously enters the family circle, and befriends an elderly neighbor who inspires him with the story of the buffalo soldiers, the black cavalrymen of the old West. Out of the entwining and unfolding of their lives, <b>The Buffalo Soldier</b> creates a suspenseful, moving portrait of a family, infused by Bohjalian\u2019s moral complexity and narrative assurance.",

    "description": "When <b>Closed Chambers</b> was first published, it was met with a firestorm of controversy--as well as a shower of praise--for being the first book to break the code of silence about the inner workings of this country's most powerful court. In this eloquent, trailblazing account, with a new chapter covering Bush v. Gore, Guantanamo, and other recent controversial court decisions, Edward Lazarus, who served as a clerk to Justice Harry Blackmun, presents a searing indictment of a court at war with itself and often in neglect of its constitutional duties. Combining memoir, history, and legal analysis, Lazarus reveals in astonishing detail the realities of what takes place behind the closed doors of the U.S. Supreme Court--an institution that through its rulings holds the power to affect the life of every American.",

    "description": "Set in the near-future, <i>Into the Forest</i> is a powerfully imagined novel that focuses on the relationship between two teenage sisters living alone in their Northern California forest home.<br /><br />Over 30 miles from the nearest town, and several miles away from their nearest neighbor, Nell and Eva struggle to survive as society begins to decay and collapse around them. No single event precedes society's fall. There is talk of a war overseas and upheaval in Congress, but it still comes as a shock when the electricity runs out and gas is nowhere to be found. The sisters consume the resources left in the house, waiting for the power to return. Their arrival into adulthood, however, forces them to reexamine their place in the world and their relationship to the land and each other.<br /><br />Reminiscent of Margaret Atwood's <i>A Handmaid's Tale, Into the Forest</i> is a mesmerizing and thought-provoking novel of hope and despair set in a frighteningly plausible near-future America.",

    "description": "In the second book starring Westchester County's most privileged middle schoolers, the Clique declares Massie a hero for hosting the first boy/girl Halloween party of 8th grade. Massie's already hired Landon Dorsey, the hottest party planner in the 9-1-4 area code, but her parents insist she has to invite the entire class. Unfortunately that means everyone. Layne is bummed that the boys will be there -- she IMs Claire that's so \"DESPR8\" -- as Claire wonders if maybe a boyfriend will make her happy.Meanwhile, Massie and the Clique are fighting over who gets to invite Derek Herrington. Dylan thought it was obvious that she was the one who danced all night with Derek at the OCD benefit last month, but says \"Whatevs\" when Kristen gets all weird about it. Fine, she can have him. He was a terrible dancer anyway and there will be tons of guys to choose from at the party....",

Here, American-trained professionals like Tara return to their old-fashioned families with heads full of Quentin Tarantino dialogue; a successful entrepreneur is shaken when his partner suddenly reneges on their plan to return to America; a traditional Indian mother slyly circumvents her Western-educated daughter\u2019s resistance to marriage; a neighborhood gossip is determined to discover what goes on behind the closed curtains of the hip young couple across the street; a chauffeur must reconcile his more orthodox credos with his employer\u2019s miniskirt lifestyle.<br /><br />Witty, affectionate, and wonderfully wise, Lavanya Sankaran\u2019s first collection attests to her remarkable literary talent.",

    "description": "Don Quixote has become so entranced by reading chivalric romances, that he determines to become a knight-errant himself. In the company of his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, his exploits blossom in all sorts of wonderful ways. While Quixote's fancy often leads him astray \u2013 he tilts at windmills, imagining them to be giants \u2013 Sancho acquires cunning and a certain sagacity. Sane madman and wise fool, they roam the world together, and together they have haunted readers' imaginations for nearly four hundred years.<br /><br />With its experimental form and literary playfulness, <i>Don Quixote</i> generally has been recognized as the first modern novel. The book has had enormous influence on a host of writers, from Fielding and Sterne to Flaubert, Dickens, Melville, and Faulkner, who reread it once a year, \"just as some people read the Bible.\"",

    "description": "In her entertaining and edifying <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, acclaimed author Francine Prose invites you to sit by her side and take a guided tour of the tools and the tricks of the masters to discover why their work has endured. Written with passion, humor, and wisdom, <i>Reading Like a Writer</i> will inspire readers to return to literature with a fresh eye and an eager heart - to take pleasure in the long and magnificent sentences of Philip Roth and the breathtaking paragraphs of Isaac Babel; she is deeply moved by the brilliant characterization in George Eliot's Middlemarch. She looks to John Le Carr\u00e9 for a lesson in how to advance plot through dialogue and to Flannery O'Connor for the cunning use of the telling detail. And, most important, Prose cautions readers to slow down and pay attention to words, the raw material out of which all literature is crafted.",

Mixing romance, mystery, comedy, and satire, <b>Bleak House</b> limns the suffering caused by the intricate inefficiency of the law. <br /><br />The text of this Modern Library Paperback Classic was set from the first single-volume edition, published by Bradbury &amp; Evans in 1853, and reproduces thirty-nine of H. K. Browne\u2019s original illustrations for the book.",

And what does this tell us about the rest of human abilities? Recent dramatic discoveries in linguistics and psychology provide intriguing answers to these age-old mysteries. In this fascinating book, Ray Jackendoff emphasizes the grammatical commonalities across languages, both spoken and signed, and discusses the implications for our understanding of language acquisition and loss.",

    "description": "From award-winning writer David Mitchell comes a sinewy, meditative novel of boyhood on the cusp of adulthood and the old on the cusp of the new.<br /><br />Black Swan Green tracks a single year in what is, for thirteen-year-old Jason Taylor, the sleepiest village in muddiest Worcestershire in a dying Cold War England, 1982. But the thirteen chapters, each a short story in its own right, create an exquisitely observed world that is anything but sleepy. A world of Kissingeresque realpolitik enacted in boys\u2019 games on a frozen lake; of \u201cnightcreeping\u201d through the summer backyards of strangers; of the tabloid-fueled thrills of the Falklands War and its human toll; of the cruel, luscious Dawn Madden and her power-hungry boyfriend, Ross Wilcox; of a certain Madame Eva van Outryve de Crommelynck, an elderly bohemian emigr\u00e9 who is both more and less than she appears; of Jason\u2019s search to replace his dead grandfather\u2019s irreplaceable smashed watch before the crime is discovered; of first cigarettes, first kisses, first Duran Duran LPs, and first deaths; of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s recession; of Gypsies camping in the woods and the hysteria they inspire; and, even closer to home, of a slow-motion divorce in four seasons.<br /><br />Pointed, funny, profound, left-field, elegiac, and painted with the stuff of life, Black Swan Green is David Mitchell\u2019s subtlest and most effective achievement to date.",

    "description": "Jessamy \u201cJess\u201d Harrison, age eight, is the child of an English father and a Nigerian mother. Possessed of an extraordinary imagination, she has a hard time fitting in at school. It is only when she visits Nigeria for the first time that she makes a friend who understands her: a ragged little girl named TillyTilly. But soon TillyTilly\u2019s visits become more disturbing, until Jess realizes she doesn\u2019t actually know who her friend is at all. Drawing on Nigerian mythology, Helen Oyeyemi presents a striking variation on the classic literary theme of doubles \u2014 both real and spiritual \u2014 in this lyrical and bold debut.",

Beah tells how, at the age of twelve, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, he\u2019d been picked up by the government army, and became a soldier.<br /><br />My new friends have begun to suspect I haven\u2019t told them the full story of my life.<br />\u201cWhy did you leave Sierra Leone?\u201d<br />\u201cBecause there is a war.\u201d<br />\u201cYou mean, you saw people running around with guns and shooting each other?\u201d<br />\u201cYes, all the time.\u201d<br />\u201cCool.\u201d<br />I smile a little.<br />\u201cYou should tell us about it sometime.\u201d<br />\u201cYes, sometime.\u201d <br /><br />This is how wars are fought now: by children, hopped-up on drugs and wielding AK-47s. Children have become soldiers of choice. In the more than fifty conflicts going on worldwide, it is estimated that there are some 300,000 child soldiers. Ishmael Beah used to be one of them. <br /><br />What is war like through the eyes of a child soldier? How does one become a killer? How does one stop? Child soldiers have been profiled by journalists, and novelists have struggled to imagine their lives. But until now, there has not been a first-person account from someone who came through this hell and survived.<br /><br />In A Long Way Gone, Beah, now twenty-five years old, tells a riveting story: how at the age of twelve, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, he\u2019d been picked up by the government army, and Beah, at heart a gentle boy, found that he was capable of truly terrible acts. <br /><br />This is a rare and mesmerizing account, told with real literary force and heartbreaking honesty.",

    "description": "<i>Napoleon's Buttons</i> is the fascinating account of seventeen groups of molecules that have greatly influenced the course of history. These molecules provided the impetus for early exploration, and made possible the voyages of discovery that ensued. The molecules resulted in grand feats of engineering and spurred advances in medicine and law; they determined what we now eat, drink, and wear. A change as small as the position of an atom can lead to enormous alterations in the properties of a substance-which, in turn, can result in great historical shifts. <br /><br /> With lively prose and an eye for colorful and unusual details, Le Couteur and Burreson offer a novel way to understand the shaping of civilization and the workings of our contemporary world.",

He's also discovered a great way to score with women - at single parents' groups, full of available mothers, all waiting for Mr Nice. That's where he meets Marcus, the oldest twelve-year-old in the world. Marcus is a bit strange: he listens to Mozart, looks after his mum and he's never even owned a pair of trainers. Perhaps if Will can teach Marcus how to be a kid, Marcus can help Will grow up...",

    "description": "Richard Thaler challenges the received economic wisdom by revealing many of the paradoxes that abound even in the most painstakingly constructed transactions. He presents literate, challenging, and often funny examples of such anomalies as why the winners at auctions are often the real losers--they pay too much and suffer the \"winner's curse\"-- why gamblers bet on long shots at the end of a losing day, why shoppers will save on one appliance only to pass up the identical savings on another, and why sports fans who wouldn't pay more than $200 for a Super Bowl ticket wouldn't sell one they own for less than $400. He also demonstrates that markets do not always operate with the traplike efficiency we impute to them.",
