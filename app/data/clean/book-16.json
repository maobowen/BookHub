    "description": "However you put it, the fear of man can be summarized this way: We replace God with people. Instead of a biblically guided fear of the Lord, we fear others. <br />Of course, the \u201cfear of man\u201d goes by other names. When we are in our teens, it is called \u201cpeer pressure.\u201d When we are older, it is called \u201cpeople-pleasing.\u201d Recently, it has been called \u201ccodependency.\u201d With these labels in mind, we can spot the fear of man everywhere. Diagnosis is fairly straightforward. <br /><br />- Have you ever struggled with peer pressure? \u201cPeer pressure\u201d is simply a euphemism for the fear of man. <br />- Are you over-committed? Do you find that it is hard to say no even when wisdom indicates that you should? Are you are a \u201cpeople-pleaser,\u201d another euphemism for the fear of man ? <br />- Do you \u201cneed\u201d something from your spouse? Do you \u201cneed\u201d your spouse to listen to you? Respect you? Think carefully here. Certainly God is pleased when there is good communication and a mutual honor between spouses. But for many people, the desire for these things has roots in something that is far from God\u2019s design for his image-bearers. Unless you understand the biblical parameters of marital commitment, your spouse will become the one you fear. Your spouse will control you. Your spouse will quietly take the place of God in your life. <br />- Is self-esteem a critical concern for you? This, at least in the United States, is the most popular way that the fear of other people is expressed. If self-esteem is a recurring theme for you, chances are that your life revolves around what others think. You reverence or fear their opinions. You need them to buttress your sense of well-being and identity. You need them to fill you up. <br />- Do you ever feel as if you might be exposed as an impostor? Many business executives and apparently successful people do. The sense of being exposed is an expression of the fear of man. It means that the opinions of other people \u2014 especially their possible opinion that you are a failure \u2014 are able to control you. <br />- Are you always second-guessing decisions because of what other people might think? Are you afraid of making mistakes that will make you look bad in other people\u2019s eyes? <br />- Do you feel empty or meaningless? Do you experience \u201clove hunger\u201d? Here again, if you need others to fill you, you are controlled by them. <br />- Do you get easily embarrassed? If so, people and their perceived opinions probably define you. Or, to use biblical language, you exalt the opinions of others to the point where you are ruled by them. <br /><br />THE problem is clear: People are too big in our lives and God is too small. The answer is straightforward: We must learn to know that our God is more loving and more powerful than we ever imagined. Yet this task is not easy. Even if we worked at the most spectacular of national parks, or the bush in our backyard started burning without being consumed, or Jesus appeared and wrestled a few rounds with us, we would not be guaranteed a persistent reverence of God. Too often our mountain-top experiences are quickly overtaken by the clamor of the world, and God once again is diminished in our minds. The goal is to establish a daily tradition of growing in the knowledge of God.",

Problems and envy between the sisters mirror those in the larger world, as society struggles to adjust to a growing pool of people who not only have 30 percent more time to work and study than normal humans, but are also highly intelligent and in perfect health. <br /><br />The Sleepless gradually outgrow their welcome on Earth, and their children escape to an orbiting space station to set up their own society. But Leisha and a few others remain behind, preaching acceptance for all humans, Sleepless and Sleeper alike. With the conspiracy and revenge that unwinds, the world needs a little preaching on tolerance.",

In engaging, accessible language, Dr. Schroeder reconciles the observable facts of science with the very essence of Western religion: the biblical account of Creation.<br /><br />Carefully reviewing and enterpreting accepted scietific principle, analogous passages of Scripture, and biblical scholarship, Dr. Schroeder arrives at a conclusion to lucid that one wonders why it has taken this long in coming. The result for the reader - whether believer or skeptic, Jewish or Christian - is a totally fresh understanding of the key events in the life of the universe.",

    "description": "The unlikely heroine of this Lisa Scottoline thriller (which follows 2006's <i>Dirty Blonde</i>), mousy University of Pennsylvania assistant law professor Natalie \"Nat\" Greco, finds herself in way over her head when an unintended visit to a minimum-security prison in nearby Chester County puts her in the middle of a deadly uprising -- and places her at the center of an elaborate plot that involves an incarcerated crime boss and more than a few improbable conspirators. <br /><br />Greco's classes at Penn Law -- the History of Justice, for example -- aren't nearly as well attended as those taught by charismatic and handsome prof Angus Holt. Greco herself is far from immune to Holt's charm, so when he asks her to accompany him to Chester County Correctional Institution to lecture to inmates involved in an externship program, she quickly agrees. But the professors' visit soon turns deadly; a riot erupts, and amid the chaos Greco finds herself alone with a dying correctional officer who has been stabbed through the heart with a metal shank. His last words are a cryptic message to his wife: \"It's under the floor.\" Soon thereafter, Greco is inexplicably set up for the murder of a state trooper and is forced to become a fugitive from justice while she tries to unravel the mystery of the dying man's words. <br /><br />While not as sexually supercharged or frenetically paced as <i>Dirty Blonde</i>, <i>Daddy's Girl</i> derives its power from the subtle and compelling coming-of-age of protagonist Greco, a sheltered and socially naive woman who, when faced with the ultimate adversity, discovers herself.",

Nuclear physicist and theologian Ian Barbour, winner of the 1999 Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion for his pioneering role in advancing the study of religion and science, presents a clear, contemporary introduction to the essential issues, ideas, and solutions in the relationship between religion and science. In simple, straightforward language, Barbour explores the fascinating topics that illuminate the critical encounter of the spiritual and quantitative dimensions of life.",

    "description": "Pricksongs &amp; Descants, originally published in 1969, is a virtuoso performance that established its author - already a William Faulkner Award winner for his first novel - as a writer of enduring power and unquestionable brilliance, a promise he has fulfilled over a stellar career. It also began Coover's now-trademark riffs on fairy tales and bedtime stories. In these riotously word-drunk fictional romps, two children follow an old man into the woods, trailing bread crumbs behind and edging helplessly toward a sinister end that never comes; a husband walks toward the bed where his wife awaits his caresses, but by the time he arrives she's been dead for three weeks and detectives are pounding down the door; a teenaged babysitter's evening becomes a kaleidoscope of dangerous erotic fantasies-her employer's, her boyfriend's, her own; an aging, humble carpenter marries a beautiful but frigid woman, and after he's waited weeks to consummate their union she announces that God has made her pregnant. Now available in a Grove paperback, Pricksongs &amp; Descants is a cornerstone of Robert Coover's remarkable career and a brilliant work by a major American writer.<br />",

    "description": "In his new work, Michel Houellebecq combines erotic provocation with a terrifying vision of a world teetering between satiety and fanaticism, to create one of the most shocking, hypnotic, and intelligent novels in years.<br /><br />In his early forties, Michel Renault skims through his days with as little human contact as possible. But following his father\u2019s death he takes a group holiday to Thailand where he meets a travel agent\u2014the shyly compelling Val\u00e9rie\u2014who begins to bring this half-dead man to life with sex of escalating intensity and audacity. Arcing with dreamlike swiftness from Paris to Pattaya Beach and from sex clubs to a terrorist massacre, <b>Platform</b> is a brilliant, apocalyptic masterpiece by a man who is widely regarded as one of the world\u2019s most original and daring writers.",

    "description": "Since its appearance in China in the third century, the Lotus Sutra has been regarded as one of the most illustrious scriptures in the Mahayana Buddhist canon. The object of intense veneration among generations of Buddhists in China, Korea, Japan, and other parts of East Asia, it has attracted more commentary than any other Buddhist scripture and has had a profound impact on the great works of Japanese and Chinese literature. Conceived as a drama of colossal proportions, the text takes on new meaning in Burton Watson's translation. Depicting events in a cosmic world that transcends ordinary concepts of time and space, the Lotus Sutra presents abstract religious concepts in concrete terms and affirms that there is a single path to enlightenment - that of the bodhisattva - and that the Buddha is not to be delimited in time and space. Filled with striking imagery. memorable parables, and countless revelations concerning the universal accessibility of Buddhahood, the Lotus Sutra has brought comfort and wisdom to devotees over the centuries and stands as a pivotal text in world literature. As Watson notes, \"The Lotus Sutra is not so much an integral work as a collection of religious texts, an anthology of sermons, stories and devotional manuals, some speaking with particular force to persons of one type or in one set of circumstances, some to those of another type or in other circumstances. This is no doubt one reason why it has had such broad and lasting appeal over the ages and has permeated so deeply into the cultures that have been exposed to it.\"",

    "description": "<br />Called a 'perfect novel' by Harold Bloom, <i>Persuasion</i> was written while Jane Austen was in failing health. She died soon after its completion, and it was published in an edition with Northanger Abbey in 1818. <br /><br />In the novel, Anne Elliot, the heroine Austen called 'almost too good for me,' has let herself be persuaded not to marry Frederick Wentworth, a fine and attractive man without means. Eight years later, Captain Wentworth returns from the Napoleonic Wars with a triumphant naval career behind him, a substantial fortune to his name, and an eagerness to wed. Austen explores the complexities of human relationships as they change over time. 'She is a prose Shakespeare,' Thomas Macaulay wrote of Austen in 1842. 'She has given us a multitude of characters, all, in a certain sense, commonplace. Yet they are all as perfectly discriminated from each other as if they were the most eccentric of human beings.'<br /><br /><i>Persuasion</i> is the last work of one of the greatest of novelists, the end of a quiet career pursued in anonymity in rural England that produced novels which continue to give pleasure to millions of readers throughout the world.",

In it, we have her two greatest comic creations -- the eccentric Mr. Woodhouse and that quintissential bore, Miss Bates. In it, too, we have her most profound characterization: the witty, imaginative, self-deluded Emma, a heroine the author declared \"no one but myself will much like, \" but who has been much loved by generations of readers.",

    "description": "<i>An alternate cover for this isbn can be found <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32929156.here\" title=\"here\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</i><br /><br />Lockwood, the new tenant of Thrushcross Grange, situated on the bleak Yorkshire moors, is forced to seek shelter one night at Wuthering Heights, the home of his landlord. There he discovers the history of the tempestuous events that took place years before; of the intense relationship between the gypsy foundling Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw; and how Catherine, forced to choose between passionate, tortured Heathcliff and gentle, well-bred Edgar Linton, surrendered to the expectations of her class. As Heathcliff's bitterness and vengeance at his betrayal is visited upon the next generation, their innocent heirs must struggle to escape the legacy of the past.<br /><br />Emily Bront\u00eb's only novel, a work of tremendous and far-reaching influence, the Penguin Classics edition of Wuthering Heights is the definitive edition of the text, edited with an introduction by Pauline Nestor. In this edition, a new preface by Lucasta Miller, author of The Bront\u00eb Myth, looks at the ways in which the novel has been interpreted, from Charlotte Bront\u00eb onwards. This complements Pauline Nestor's introduction, which discusses changing critical receptions of the novel, as well as Emily Bront\u00eb's influences and background.<br /><br />Emily Bront\u00eb (1818-48), along with her sisters, Charlotte and Anne, was one of the most significant literary figures of the 19th century. She wrote just one strikingly innovative novel, Wuthering Heights, but was also a gifted and intense poet.<br /><br />'Wuthering Heights is commonly thought of as \"romantic\", but try rereading it without being astonished by the comfortableness with which Bront\u00eb's characters subject one another to extremes of physical and psychological violence'<br />Jeanette Winterson<br /><br />'As a first novel, there is very little that can compare to it. Even Shakespeare took over a decade to reach the clifftop extremities of King Lear'<br />Sarah Waters",

    "description": "<i>'Oh, why, dear God, did I marry him?'</i><br /><br />Emma Bovary is beautiful and bored, trapped in her marriage to a mediocre doctor and stifled by the banality of provincial life. An ardent devourer of sentimental novels, she longs for passion and seeks escape in fantasies of high romance, in voracious spending and, eventually, in adultery. But even her affairs bring her disappointment, and when real life continues to fail to live up to her romantic expectations, the consequences are devastating. Flaubert's erotically charged and psychologically acute portrayal of Emma Bovary caused a moral outcry on its publication in 1857. It was deemed so lifelike that many women claimed they were the model for his heroine; but Flaubert insisted: 'Madame Bovary, c'est moi.'<br /><br />This modern translation by Flaubert's biographer, Geoffrey Wall, retains all the delicacy and precision of the French original. The edition also contains a preface by the novelist Mich\u00e8le Roberts.",

In this landmark book, Daniel Dennett refutes the traditional, commonsense theory of consciousness and presents a new model, based on a wealth of information from the fields of neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence.

    "description": "\"If thirteen is supposed to be an unlucky number...you would think a civilized society could come up with a way for us to skip it.\"<br /><br /> -- from <i>\"What's the Worst That Could Happen?\"</i> by Bruce Coville <br /><br /> No one will want to skip any of the twelve short stories and one poem that make up this collection by some of the most celebrated contemporary writers of teen fiction. The big bar mitzvah that goes suddenly, wildly, hilariously out of control. A first kiss -- and a realization about one's sexual orientation. A crush on a girl that ends up putting the boy who likes her in the hospital. A pair of sneakers a kid has to have. By turns funny and sad, wrenching and poignant, the moments large and small described in these stories capture perfectly the agony and ecstasy of being thirteen.",

    "description": "<b>Daniel C. Dennett's <i>Freedom Evolves </i>tackles the most important question of human existence - is there really such a thing as free will?</b><br /><br />How can humans make genuinely independent choices if we are just a cluster of cells and genes in a world determined by scientific laws?<br /><br />Here, Daniel Dennett provides an impassioned defense of free will. But rather than freedom being an eternal, unchanging condition of our existence, in reality, he reveals, it has evolved: just like life on the planet and the air we breathe. Evolution is the key to resolving this greatest of philosophical questions - and to understanding our place in the world as uniquely free agents.<br /><br />Dennett shows that far from there being an incompatibility between contemporary science and the traditional vision of freedom and morality, it is only recently that science has advanced to the point where we can see how we came to have our unique kind of freedom.<br /><br />'A serious book with a brilliant message'<br />\u00a0\u00a0Matt Ridley, author of <i>The Red Queen</i><br /><br />'Powerful and ingenious ... The definitive argument that the human mind is a product of evolution'<br />\u00a0\u00a0John Gray, <i>Independent</i><br /><br />'A book of sparkling brio and seemingly effortless panache ... Dennett at his best is as good as it gets'<br />\u00a0\u00a0<i>Spectator</i><br /><br /><b>Daniel C. Dennett</b> is one of the most original and provocative thinkers in the world. A brilliant polemicist and philosopher, he is famous for challenging unexamined orthodoxies, and an outspoken supporter of the Brights movement. His books include <i>Brainstorms</i>, <i>Brainchildren</i>, <i>Elbow Room</i>, <i>Breaking the Spell</i>, <i>Darwin's Dangerous Idea</i> and <i>Freedom Evolves</i>.",

    "description": "Eliza Naumann, a seemingly unremarkable nine-year-old, expects never to fit into her gifted family: her autodidact father, Saul, absorbed in his study of Jewish mysticism; her brother, Aaron, the vessel of his father's spiritual ambitions; and her brilliant but distant lawyer-mom, Miriam. But when Eliza sweeps her school and district spelling bees in quick succession, Saul takes it as a sign that she is destined for greatness. In this altered reality, Saul inducts her into his hallowed study and lavishes upon her the attention previously reserved for Aaron, who in his displacement embarks upon a lone quest for spiritual fulfillment. When Miriam's secret life triggers a familial explosion, it is Eliza who must order the chaos.<br /><br />Myla Goldberg's keen eye for detail brings Eliza's journey to three-dimensional life. As she rises from classroom obscurity to the blinding lights and outsized expectations of the National Bee, Eliza's small pains and large joys are finely wrought and deeply felt.<br /><br />Not merely a coming-of-age story, Goldberg's first novel delicately examines the unraveling fabric of one family. The outcome of this tale is as startling and unconventional as her prose, which wields its metaphors sharply and rings with maturity. The work of a lyrical and gifted storyteller, <b>Bee Season</b> marks the arrival of an extraordinarily talented new writer.",

    "description": "\"Nabokov writes prose the only way it should be written, that is, ecstatically.\" -- John Updike<br /><br />The Real Life of Sebastian Knight is a perversely magical literary detective story -- subtle, intricate, leading to a tantalizing climax -- about the mysterious life of a famous writer. Many people knew things about Sebastian Knight as a distinguished novelist, but probably fewer than a dozen knew of the two love affairs that so profoundly influenced his career, the second one in such a disastrous way. After Knight's death, his half brother sets out to penetrate the enigma of his life, starting with a few scanty clues in the novelist's private papers. His search proves to be a story as intriguing as any of his subject's own novels, as baffling, and, in the end, as uniquely rewarding.",

    "description": "<i>The Collected Poems of W. B. Yeats</i> includes all of the poems authorized by Yeats for inclusion in his standard canon. Breathtaking in range, it encompasses the entire arc of his career, from luminous reworking of ancient Irish myths and legends, to passionate meditations on the demands and rewards of youth and old age, from exquisite, occasionally whimsical songs of love, nature, and art to somber and angry poems of life in a nation torn by war and uprising. In observing the development of rich and recurring images and themes over the course of his body of work, we can trace the quest of this century's greatest poet to unite intellect and artistry in a single magnificent vision.<br /><br />Revised and corrected, this edition includes Yeat's own notes on his poetry, complemented by explanatory notes from esteemed Yeats scholar Richard J. Finneran. <i>The Collected Poems of W. B. Yeats</i> is the most comprehensive edition of one of the world's most beloved poets available in paperback.",

Now, more than twenty years later, he is a celebrated figure in London society; yet the investigative expertise that has garnered him fame has done little to illuminate the circumstances of his parents' alleged kidnappings. Banks travels to the seething, labyrinthine city of his memory in hopes of solving the mystery of his own, painful past, only to find that war is ravaging Shanghai beyond recognition-and that his own recollections are proving as difficult to trust as the people around him.<br /><br />Masterful, suspenseful and psychologically acute, <b>When We Were Orphans</b><i> </i>offers a profound meditation on the shifting quality of memory, and the possibility of avenging one\u2019s past.",

    "description": "The phenomenal Russian bestseller. A vampire novel set in a richly realized post-Soviet Moscow, <b>The Night Watch</b> has sold across Europe and to 20th Century Fox for huge advances.<br /><br />In <b>The Night Watch</b>, the first of a trilogy, and reminiscent of Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials in its ambitions and achievement, the setting is contemporary Moscow. A small number of Muscovites with supernatural powers \u2014 those who are Other, owing allegiance either to the Dark or the Light \u2014 co-exist in an uneasy truce, each side keeping a close eye on the other\u2019s activities around the city.<br /><br />Anton, an Other on the side of the Light, is a night-watchman, patrolling the streets and Metro of the city as he protects ordinary people from the vampires of the Dark. On his rounds, Anton comes across a young woman, Svetlana, whom he realizes is under a curse that threatens the entire city, and a boy, Igor, a young Other, as yet unaware of his own enormous power. Partnered by Olga, an Other who is in the form of an owl, he struggles to remove the curse and thereby save the city, while at the same time prevent Igor from falling into the clutches of the Dark. <br /><br /><b>The Night Watch</b> explores the nature of good and evil and the tensions between the individual and the collective in a gripping narrative that owes as much to The Master and Margarita as it is does to the richly realized worlds of Philip Pullman and Tolkien.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",

This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the \"Others,\" an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light. The agents of Light - the Night Watch - oversee nocturnal activity, while the agents of Dark keep watch over the day.

    "description": "New York Times bestselling author Jennifer Weiner\u2019s unforgettable story of adjusting to suburbia\u2014and all the surprises hidden behind its doors.<br /><br />For Kate Klein, a semi-accidental mother of three, suburbia has been full of unpleasant surprises. Her once-loving husband is hardly ever home. The supermommies on the playground routinely snub her. Her days are spent carpooling and enduring endless games of Candy Land, and at night, most of her orgasms are of the do-it-yourself variety.<br /><br />When a fellow mother is murdered, Kate finds that the unsolved mystery is the most exciting thing to happen in Upchurch, Connecticut, since her neighbors broke ground for a guesthouse and cracked their septic tank. Even though the local police chief warns her that crime-fighting's a job best left to the professionals, Kate launches an unofficial investigation -- from 8:45 to 11:30 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, when her kids are in nursery school.<br /><br />As Kate is drawn deeper into the murdered woman's past, she begins to uncover the secrets and lies behind Upchurch's picket-fence facade -- and considers the choices and compromises all modern women make as they navigate between marriage and independence, small towns and big cities, being a mother and having a life of one's own.",

    "description": "Set against the backdrop of a lush and exotic Greece, <b>The Names</b> is considered the book which began to drive \"sharply upward the size of his readership\" (<i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i>). Among the cast of DeLillo's bizarre yet fully realized characters in <b>The Names</b> are Kathryn, the narrator's estranged wife; their son, the six-year-old novelist; Owen, the scientist; and the neurotic narrator obsessed with his own neuroses. A thriller, a mystery, and still a moving examination of family, loss, and the amorphous and magical potential of language itself, <b>The Names</b> stands with any of DeLillo's more recent and highly acclaimed works. <br /><br />\"<b>The Names</b> not only accurately reflects a portion of our contemporary world but, more importantly, an original world of its own is created.\"--<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i><br /><br />\"DeLillo sifts experience through simultaneous grids of science and poetry, analysis and clear sight, to make a high-wire prose that is voluptuously stark.\"--<i>Village Voice Literary Supplement</i><br /><br />\"DeLillo verbally examines every state of consciousness from eroticism to tourism, from the idea of America as conceived by the rest of the world, to the idea of the rest of the world as conceived by America, from mysticism to fanaticism.\"--<i>New York Times</i>",

And still they remain untouched, \"players\" indifferent to the violence that surrounds them, and that they have helped to create.",

David's world is made up of the images that flicker across America's TV screens, the fantasies that enthrall America's imagination.<br /><br />And the dream--and the dream-making--become a nightmare. At the height of his success, David sets out to rediscover reality. Camera in hand, he journeys across the country in a mad and moving attempt to capture, to impose a pattern on his own, and America's past, present, and future.",

    "description": "One of DeLillo's first novels, <b>Ratner's Star</b>\u00a0\u00a0follows Billy, the genius adolescent, who is recruited to live in obscurity, underground, as he tries to help a panel of estranged, demented, and yet lovable scientists communicate with beings from outer space. It is a mix of quirky humor, science, mathematical theories, as well as the complex emotional distance and sadness people feel. <b>Ratner's Star</b> demonstrates both the thematic and prosaic muscularity that typifies DeLillo's later and more recent works, like <i>The Names</i> (which is also available in Vintage Contemporaries).",

    "description": "Why do we do missions? We are told, by Jesus, to preach the gospel and make disciples of all nations. So missions is duty, right? Wrong. If you do missions purely from a sense of duty you will not honor those you are reaching out to, nor will you truly honor God. Duty is the wrong place to look, so where do we find the answer to why we do missions? We turn, according to John Piper, to worship. // In our worship of God we encounter God's glory. The overflow from our worship is a desire to share God's glory with others (the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever), and we naturally become missional. When Jesus was asked what the kingdom of God was like, he compared it to a pearl so valuable that one would sell all they owned simply to possess it. Does that seem like duty to you? Instead, Jesus calls us to a new mindset, which flows from the mindset that worship creates in us. Thus, according to Piper, does worship become the goal of missions and the fuel which makes missions possible. // Worship as the fuel for missions makes sense to a lot of people, but worship as the goal of missions? Piper reminds us that the true reason we share God with others is to make them worshipers (and sharers) as well. He feels that the true goal of missions is \"the gladness of the peoples in the greatness of God.\" If it is true, (as Piper states) that \"God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him,\" then increasing the number of people who are satisfied in God will bring God more glory. And missions is the way we can do that. // Missions must be seen as more than simply saving people from sin, though that is a very important aspect. And missions is not just about getting people into heaven, although that is important as well. Instead, through missions we should always seek to make as many people as possible into true worshipers, into those fully satisfied with the greatness of God. // With that mindset, missions becomes a joyous experience, as we joyfully share the life-changing presence of God in our lives with those who don't know God. When we have made worship both the fuel and goal of all our missionary endeavors, we realize that \"missions is not a recruitment project for God's labor force. It is a liberation project from the heavy burdens and hard yokes of other gods.\" Missions is never a burden, because it comes out of our overwhelming joy in God's grace and mercy, and we just want to share that joy. So make God the center of your missions work, and joyfully share what He has graciously given to you.",

    "description": "<br /><div>For thirty years, Robert Ludlum's novels have set the standard for the finest in international intrigue and suspense. With an unbroken string of bestsellers in almost every country in the world, his books have been enjoyed by hundreds of millions of readers and are widely acknowledged as classics in the field. Now, after the bestselling Covert-One novels <i>The Hades Factor </i>and <i>The Cassandra Compact</i>, comes the third thrilling novel in the series.<br /><br />A fiery explosion in the dark of night shatters one of the laboratory buildings in Paris's esteemed Pasteur Institute. Among the dead is Emile Chambord, one of the leaders in the global race to create a molecular or DNA computer. Unfortunately, Professor Chambord kept the details of his work secret, and his notes were apparently destroyed in either the bomb blast or the raging fire that followed. Under the cover of visiting his friend Marty Zellerbach, who was severely injured when the Pasteur lab was destroyed, Covert-One agent Jon Smith flies to Paris to search for the connection between the Pasteur explosion and the forces now wielding the computer. Following a trail that leads him across two continents, Smith uncovers a web of deception that threatens to wreck havoc and forever reshape the world.<br /></div><br />",

England is beleaguered by the long war with Napoleon, and centuries have passed since practical magicians faded into the nation's past. But scholars of this glorious history discover that one remains: the reclusive Mr Norrell whose displays of magic send a thrill through the country. Proceeding to London, he raises a beautiful woman from the dead and summons an army of ghostly ships to terrify the French. Yet the cautious, fussy Norrell is challenged by the emergence of another magician: the brilliant novice Jonathan Strange. Young, handsome and daring, Strange is the very opposite of Norrell. So begins a dangerous battle between these two great men which overwhelms the one between England and France. And their own obsessions and secret dabblings with the dark arts are going to cause more trouble than they can imagine.",

    "description": "The first science fiction written by a black woman, <i>Kindred</i> has become a cornerstone of black American literature. This combination of slave memoir, fantasy, and historical fiction is a novel of rich literary complexity. Having just celebrated her 26th birthday in 1976 California, Dana, an African-American woman, is suddenly and inexplicably wrenched through time into antebellum Maryland. After saving a drowning white boy there, she finds herself staring into the barrel of a shotgun and is transported back to the present just in time to save her life. During numerous such time-defying episodes with the same young man, she realizes the challenge she\u2019s been given: to protect this young slaveholder until he can father her own great-grandmother.",

That night a forest begins to grow in Max's room and an ocean rushes by with a boat to take Max to the place where the wild things are. Max tames the wild things and crowns himself as their king, and then the wild rumpus begins. But when Max has sent the monsters to bed, and everything is quiet, he starts to feel lonely and realises it is time to sail home to the place where someone loves him best of all.",

    "description": "Imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion. This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.<br /><br />\"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\" <br /><br />So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy-- exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling-- does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. <br /><br />Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors--yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness. <br /><br />Angela's Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.",

    "description": "His birth was marked by wonder and tragedy. <br />He sees beauty and terror beyond our deepest dreams. <br />His story will change the way you see the world. <br />On the heels of his #1 bestseller False Memory, Dean Koontz brings together his most compelling themes and an unforgettable cast of characters to create what is perhaps the most thrilling and emotionally powerful work of his critically acclaimed career. <br />Bartholomew Lampion is born on a day of tragedy and terror that will mark his family forever. All agree that his unusual eyes are the most beautiful they have ever seen. On this same day, a thousand miles away, a ruthless man learns that he has a mortal enemy named Bartholomew. He embarks on a relentless search to find this enemy, a search that will consume his life. And a girl is born from a brutal rape, her destiny mysteriously linked to Barty and the man who stalks him. <br />At the age of three, Barty Lampion is blinded when surgeons remove his eyes to save him from a fast-spreading cancer. As he copes with his blindness and proves to be a prodigy, his mother counsels him that all things happen for a reason and that every person' s life has an effect on every other person' s, in often unknowable ways. <br />At thirteen, Bartholomew regains his sight. How he regains it, why he regains it, and what happens as his amazing life unfolds and entwines with others results in a breathtaking journey of courage, heart-stopping suspense, and high adventure.",

At its core are the candid assessments of former Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill, the only member of Bush's cabinet to leave and speak frankly about how and why the administration has come to its core policies and decisions -- from cutting taxes for the rich to conducting preemptive war.<br /><br />O'Neill's account is supported by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ron Suskind's interviews with numerous participants in the administration, by transcripts of meetings, and by voluminous documents. The result is a disclosure of breadth and depth unparalleled for an ongoing presidency. As readers are taken to the very epicenter of government, Suskind presents an astonishing picture of a president so carefully managed in his public posture that he is a mystery to most Americans. Now, he is revealed.",

    "description": "It was under the bodhi tree in India twenty-five centuries ago that Buddha achieved the insight that three states of mind were the source of all our unhappiness: wrong knowing, obsessive desire, and anger. All are difficult, but in one instant of anger\u2014one of the most powerful emotions\u2014lives can be ruined, and health and spiritual development can be destroyed. With exquisite simplicity, Buddhist monk and Vietnam refugee Thich Nhat Hanh gives tools and advice for transforming relationships, focusing energy, and rejuvenating those parts of ourselves that have been laid waste by anger. His extraordinary wisdom can transform your life and the lives of the people you love, and in the words of Thich Nhat Hanh, can give each reader the power to \"change everything.\"",

    "description": "<i>God's Debris</i> is the first non-humor book by best-selling author Scott Adams. Adams describes <i>God's Debris</i> as a thought experiment wrapped in a story. It's designed to make your brain spin around inside your skull. Imagine that you meet a very old man who you eventually realize knows literally everything. Imagine that he explains for you the great mysteries of life: quantum physics, evolution, God, gravity, light psychic phenomenon, and probability in a way so simple, so novel, and so compelling that it all fits together and makes perfect sense. What does it feel like to suddenly understand everything? You may not find the final answer to the big question, but <i>God's Debris</i> might provide the most compelling vision of reality you will ever read. The thought experiment is this: Try to figure out what's wrong with the old man's explanation of reality. Share the book with your smart friends, then discuss it later while enjoying a beverage.",

His sentence: to be reborn on Earth as a dog until such time as he carries out the seemingly impossible mission imposed on him.</p><p>In his Earth guise, Sirius, renamed Leo, truly lives a dog's life. Although he is the pet of a girl who loves him, both child and dog are mistreated by the family with whom they live. But the worldly obstacles Leo faces are minor when compared with his chilling encounters with the Dark Powers that are set against him. His quest seems hopeless until at last Sol, Moon, and Earth itself come to his aid.</p><p><i>Dogsbody</i> is a tense, exciting, sciencefiction fantasy, a thriller, and a touching dog story all in one.</p>",

    "description": "Shalom Auslander's stories in <i>Beware of God</i> have the mysterious punch of a dream. They are wide ranging and inventive: A young Jewish man's inexplicable transformation into a very large, blond, tattooed goy ends with an argument over whether or not his father can beat his unclean son with a copy of the Talmud. A pious man having a near-death experience discovers that God is actually a chicken, and he's forced to reconsider his life -- and his diet. At God's insistence, Leo Schwartzman searches Home Depot for supplies for an ark. And a young boy mistakes Holocaust Remembrance Day as emergency preparedness training for the future. <br /><br /> Auslander draws upon his upbringing in an Orthodox Jewish community in New York State to craft stories that are filled with shame, sex, God, and death, but also manage to be wickedly funny and poignant.",

    "description": "Clive Barker's bestseller <i>Weaveworld</i> astonished readers with his visionary range, establishing him as a master of fabulist literature. Now, with <i>The Great and Secret Show</i> he rises to new heights. In this unforgettable epic he wields the full power and sweep of his talents. \"Succinctly put,\" says Barker, \"it's about Hollywood, sex and Armageddon.\"<br /><br /> Memory, prophecy and fantasy; the past, the future, and the dreaming moment between are all one country living one immortal day. To know that is Wisdom. To use it is the Art.<br /> Armageddon begins with a murder in the Dead Letter Office in Omaha. A lake that has never existed falls from the clouds over Palomo Grove, CA. Young passion blossoms, as the world withers with war. The Great and Secret Show has begun on the stage of the world. Soon the final curtain must fall.<br /><br /> In this, the First Book of the Art, Barker has created a masterpiece of the imagination that explores the uncharted territory within our secret lives and most private hearts. Sprawling, ambitious, triumphantly magical and satisfying, <i>The Great and Secret Show </i> is what the rest of life is all about.",

    "description": "Secrets of the Millionaire Mind reveals the missing link between wanting success and achieving it! Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?<br /><br />The shocking answer is: None of the above!<br /><br />In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: \"Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!\" Eker does this by identifying your \"money and success blueprint.\" We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money -- and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.<br /><br />Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and \"revise\" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.<br /><br />In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen \"Wealth Files,\" which describe exactly howrich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.<br /><br />If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!",

But soon Bazarov\u2019s outspoken rejection of authority and social conventions touches off quarrels, misunderstandings, and romantic entanglements that will utterly transform the Kirsanov household and reflect the changes taking place across all of nineteenth-century Russia. <br /><br />Fathers and Sons enraged the old and the young, reactionaries, romantics, and radicals alike when it was first published. At the same time, Turgenev won the acclaim of Flaubert, Maupassant, and Henry James for his craftsmanship as a writer and his psychological insight. Fathers and Sons is now considered one of the greatest novels of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />A timeless depiction of generational conflict during social upheaval, it vividly portrays the clash between the older Russian aristocracy and the youthful radicalism that foreshadowed the revolution to come\u2014and offers modern-day readers much to reflect upon as they look around at their own tumultuous, ever changing world. <br /><br />Introduction by Jane Costlow",

    "description": "A worldwide plague causes the dead to walk...and they're attacking the living! A group of just over one hundred survivors seek shelter in a local rescue center. As time passes and the situation deteriorates, the overcrowded shelter becomes a potential deathtrap. The group's leaders then forge a plan to clear out and move to a small correctional facility in an outlying area of the county.<br /><br />As they prepare to move to a more secure refuge, another pocket of survivors led by a delusional religious zealot are forming their own twisted plans. Meanwhile, deep beneath a secret mountaintop government installation, the cumbersome wheels of establishment grind on. As the surviving militant faction seizes control, a small group of scientists struggle to unravel the mysterious origin of the plague.<br /><br />The story culminates in a deadly confrontation between the surviving factions and the living dead. Who will triumph in the end? \"Reign of the Dead\" is a story of horror and heartbreak, good versus evil, love lost then reborn, and about survival against insurmountable odds.<br /><br />Prepare yourself for the \"Reign of the Dead!\"",

    "description": "Acclaimed journalist Ted Conover sets a new standard for bold, in-depth reporting in this first-hand account of life inside the penal system.<br /><br />When Conover\u2019s request to shadow a recruit at the New York State Corrections Officer Academy was denied, he decided to apply for a job as a prison officer. So begins his odyssey at Sing Sing, once a model prison but now the state\u2019s most troubled maximum-security facility. The result of his year there is this remarkable look at one of America\u2019s most dangerous prisons, where drugs, gang wars, and sex are rampant, and where the line between violator and violated is often unclear. As sobering as it is suspenseful, <b>Newjack</b> is an indispensable contribution to the urgent debate about our country\u2019s criminal justice system, and a consistently fascinating read.",

    "description": "Maxim Gorky continues to be regarded as the greatest literary representative of revolutionary Russia. Born of the people, and having experienced in his own person their sufferings and their misery, he was enabled by his extraordinary genius to voice their grievances and their aspirations for a better life as no academic could. His international fame rests on a tremendous literary output, including the powerful play \"The Lower Depths,\" the monumental novel of the 1905 Russian Revolution, \"Mother,\" his vital Autobiography and, of course, his short stories. This edition of \"The Collected Short Stories of Maxim Gorky\" includes his benchmark masterpieces \"Creatures That Once Were Men\" and \"Twenty-Six Men and a Girl\" as well as \"Chelkash and My Fellow-Traveller\" among many others. The collection represents the very best of Gorky's genius.<br /><br />For this edition the renowned scholar and author Frederic Ewen has written a penetrating new introduction evaluating Gorky's place in the world's literary pantheon.",

    "description": "Welcome to Empire Falls, a blue-collar town full of abandoned mills whose citizens surround themselves with the comforts and feuds provided by lifelong friends and neighbors and who find humor and hope in the most unlikely places, in this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Richard Russo.<br /><br />Miles Roby has been slinging burgers at the Empire Grill for 20 years, a job that cost him his college education and much of his self-respect. What keeps him there? It could be his bright, sensitive daughter Tick, who needs all his help surviving the local high school. Or maybe it\u2019s Janine, Miles\u2019 soon-to-be ex-wife, who\u2019s taken up with a noxiously vain health-club proprietor. Or perhaps it\u2019s the imperious Francine Whiting, who owns everything in town\u2013and seems to believe that \u201ceverything\u201d includes Miles himself. In Empire Falls Richard Russo delves deep into the blue-collar heart of America in a work that overflows with hilarity, heartache, and grace",

    "description": "<i>Howards End</i>, by <b>E. M. Forster</b>, is part of the <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i><i>\u00a0</i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i>:<br />All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics </i>pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.<br /><br /><br />\u00a0Considered by many to be <b>E. M. Forster</b>\u2019s greatest novel, <i>Howards End</i> is a beautifully subtle tale of two very different families brought together by an unusual event. The Schlegels are intellectuals, devotees of art and literature. The Wilcoxes are practical and materialistic, leading lives of \u201ctelegrams and anger.\u201d When the elder Mrs. Wilcox dies and her family discovers she has left their country home\u2014Howards End\u2014to one of the Schlegel sisters, a crisis between the two families is precipitated that takes years to resolve. Written in 1910, <i>Howards End</i> is a symbolic exploration of the social, economic, and intellectual forces at work in England in the years preceding World War I, a time when vast social changes were occurring. In the Schlegels and the Wilcoxes, Forster perfectly embodies the competing idealism and materialism of the upper classes, while the conflict over the ownership of Howards End represents the struggle for possession of the country\u2019s future. As critic Lionel Trilling once noted, the novel asks, \u201cWho shall inherit England?\u201d<br /><br />Forster refuses to take sides in this conflict. Instead he poses one of the book\u2019s central questions: In a changing modern society, what should be the relation between the inner and outer life, between the world of the intellect and the world of business? Can they ever, as Forster urges, \u201conly connect\u201d?<br /><br /><b>Mary Gordon</b> is a McIntosh Professor of English at Barnard College. Her best-selling novels include <i>Final Payments, The Company of Women</i>, and <i>Spending</i>. She has also published a memoir, a book of novellas, a collection of stories, and two books of essays. Her most recent work is a biography of Joan of Arc.",

    "description": "Courtney Colvin was nearing the end of her teenage years when the undead apocalypse began. She survived, forsaking her youth and innocence, and five years later she continues to exist--albeit lonely--in the fortified town of Eastpointe. Nightmares and the unwelcome advances of Leon Wolfe are the worst things she's dealing with now in her otherwise mundane life. But when a newcomer arrives in town and claims to know the location of the antidote to the zombie plague, it sends Eastpointe into an uproar. To retrieve this cure, she and a group of other survivors must venture outside the relative safety of the compound's walls and into a world ruled and dominated by the flesh-eating undead. Twilight of the Dead puts a new spin on the zombie genre, yet remains true to the classic rules that have already been set forth. A sure-fire reading pleasure for anyone who loves character-driven horror. This Special Edition contains an Introduction by David Moody and three bonus short stories detailing important moments in the lives of other survivors.",

She escapes to Berkeley, where she finds solace in a young art student named John Wheelwright. They embark on an intense, all-consuming affair, until the day Molly disappears\u2013again. A decade later, John is lured by the eccentric advertising visionary Mal Osbourne into a risky venture that threatens to eviscerate every concept, slogan, and gimmick exported by Madison Avenue. And much to John\u2019s amazement, one of the many swept into Osbourne\u2019s creative vortex is the woman who left him devastated so many years before.",

    "description": "Engagingly written, Unholy Alliance is a comprehensive, popular history of the occult background and roots of the Nazi movement, showing how the ideas of a vast international network of late 19th- and early 20th-century occult groups influenced Nazi ideology. Levenda takes readers through the teachings of Madame Blavatsky, Aleister Crowley, the Thule Gesellschaft - the occult secret society that formed the ideological heart of the early Nazi Party - the Order of the Golden Dawn, and the Order of the Eastern Temple and demonstrates how each influenced Nazi ideology. He also details the expedition to Tibet of the Ancestral Heritage Research and Teaching Society, comprised of the same SS officers who would later be involved in grisly medical experiments on concentration camp prisoners. Levenda traces the Nazis' movements as they continued their activities after the war or morphed into neo-Nazi, skinhead, and satanic groups, such as the Christian Identity and White Aryan Resistance movements. Levenda's is not only a \"major work of investigative reporting,\" but also the striking story of the unholy alliance between politics and religion - or politics and occultism - that has dominated events in Europe and the Americas since World War I, with all its implications for continuing racial and religious violence in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.",

A lay Carmelite brother, Lawrence spent most of his time in the monastery's kitchens, and his simple, earthy observations on the direct paths to communication with God continue to inspire those seeking a stronger, more potent spirituality today.",

    "description": "One fall morning Jerry Ellis donned a backpack and began a long, lonely walk: retracing the Cherokee Trail of Tears, the nine hundred miles his ancestors had walked in 1838. The trail was the agonizing path of exile the Cherokees had been forced to take when they were torn from their southeastern homeland and relocated to Indian Territory. Following in their footsteps, Ellis traveled through small southern towns, along winding roads, and amid quiet forests, encountering a memorable array of people who live along the trail today. Along the way he also came to glimpse the pain his ancestors endured and to learn about the true beauty of modern rural life and the worth of a man's character.",

Its hero is Harry \u201cRabbit\u201d Angstrom, a onetime high-school basketball star who on an impulse deserts his wife and son. He is twenty-six years old, a man-child caught in a struggle between instinct and thought, self and society, sexual gratification and family duty \u2014 even, in a sense, human hard-heartedness and divine Grace. Though his flight from home traces a zigzag of evasion, he holds to the faith that he is on the right path, an invisible line toward his own salvation as straight as a ruler\u2019s edge.",

    "description": "A beautiful society wife from St. Petersburg, determined to live life on her own terms, sacrifices everything to follow her conviction that love is stronger than duty. A socially inept but warmhearted landowner pursues his own visions instead of conforming to conventional views. The adulteress and the philosopher head the vibrant cast of characters in <i>Anna Karenina,</i> Tolstoy's tumultuous tale of passion and self-discovery. <br />This novel marks a turning point in the author's career, the juncture at which he turned from fiction toward faith. Set against a backdrop of the historic social changes that swept Russia during the late nineteenth century, it reflects Tolstoy's own personal and psychological transformation. Two worlds collide in the course of this epochal story: that of the old-time aristocrats, who struggle to uphold their traditions of serfdom and authoritarian government, and that of the Westernizing liberals, who promote technology, rationalism, and democracy. This cultural clash unfolds in a compelling, emotional drama of seduction, betrayal, and redemption.",

Daphne Kalotay's characters confront regrets and unrealized hopes in tales tinged with gentle humor. A newly independent woman finds herself in bed with an ex-husband of long ago. A little girl gets a surprising glimpse into adulthood when she catches her mother in a moment of uninhibited pleasure. A thirteen-year-old boy contends with the unwanted attentions of a younger girl. And for two older women, a tie formed in their youth sustains them through varied twists of fate. These are dazzling intertwined tales of love, failure, and the comedy of human relationships.",

Naipaul is an intimate record of a literary mentorship that traces the growth of both writers' careers and explores the unique effect each had on the other. Built around exotic landscapes, anecdotes that are revealing, humorous, and melancholy, and three decades of mutual history, this is a personal account of how one develops as a writer and how a friendship waxes and wanes between two men who have set themselves on the perilous journey of a writing life.",

    "description": "Duncan took almost 10 years to follow up the publication of his much-praised first novel, <b>The River Why</b>, but this massive second effort is well worth the wait. It is a stunning work: a complex tapestry of family tensions, baseball, politics and religion, by turns hilariously funny and agonizingly sad. Highly inventive formally, the novel is mainly narrated by Kincaid Chance, the youngest son in a family of four boys and identical twin girls, the children of Hugh Chance, a discouraged minor-league ballplayer whose once-promising career was curtained by an industrial accident, and his wife Laura, an increasingly fanatical Seventh-Day Adventist. The plot traces the working-out of the family's fate from the beginning of the Eisenhower years through the traumas of Vietnam.",

    "description": "Lewis is sure that Grandpa Barnavelt's 1859 lucky coin is really a magic talisman in disguise. With its power, he could do anything he wanted--like get back at bully Woody Mingo. But as soon as he begins wearing the coin around his neck, strange things start to happen. Mysterious letters arrive in the dead of night. A strange, shadowy figure seems to be tracking him. And when Lewis finally gets his revenge on Woody, he feels as if <i>someone else</i> is inside his body, urging him to go even further. Has Lewis awakened a force beyond his control?",

          "description": "The Lewis Barnavelt series of adventures was created by John Bellairs, starting with the award-winning 1973 book The House with a Clock in its Walls. Bellairs quickly followed up with two adventures in the series starring Lewis (The Figure in the Shadows; 1975) and his friend Rose Rita Pottinger (The Letter, the Witch, and the Ring; 1976). \n    \n    The series was dormant during the 1980s as Bellairs focused his books on the escapades of Johnny Dixon but was on the verge of a comeback when Bellairs died in 1991. Author Brad Strickland was commissioned to complete the two book Bellairs had begun prior to his death \u2013 The Ghost in the Mirror and The Vengeance of the Witch-finder \u2013 as well as construct a novel from Bellairs\u2019 scant notes, which would evolve into The Doom of the Haunted Opera.\n    \n    In 1998 Dial published The Specter from the Magician's Museum, the first in the Barnavelt series to have been written entirely by Strickland. As of 2008, the 12-book series is still in production with The Sign of the Sinister Sorcerer the most recent title.\n    \n    When the Barnavelt series was translated into French in 2001, the publisher changed Lewis\u2019s name to K\u00e9vin and Rose Rita\u2019s to Emily \u2013 \"to give the books a more American feel to French readers,\" according to French illustrator Lalex.",

But when two young boys venture into the woods, and only one returns alive, Mears begins to realize that something sinister is at work in fact, his hometown is under siege from forces of darkness far beyond his imagination. And only he, with a small group of allies, can hope to contain the evil that is growing within the borders of this small New England town. <br />With this, his second novel, Stephen King established himself as an indisputable master of American horror, able to transform the old conceits of the genre into something fresh and all the more frightening for taking place in a familiar, idyllic locale.\"",

Simply look at the dreams and desires written in the heart of every boy: To be a hero, to be a warrior, to live a life of adventure and risk. Sadly, most men abandon those dreams and desires-aided by a Christianity that feels like nothing more than pressure to be a \"nice guy.\" It is no wonder that many men avoid church, and those who go are often passive and bored to death. In this provocative book, Eldredge gives women a look inside the true heart of a man and gives men permission to be what God designed them to be-dangerous, passionate, alive, and free!",

    "description": "In this <i>New</i> <i>York</i> <i>Times</i> bestseller, internationally renowned Japanese scientist Masaru Emoto shows how the influence of our thoughts, words and feelings on molecules of water can positively impact the earth and our personal health.<br /><br />This book has the potential to profoundly transform your world view. Using high-speed photography, Dr. Masaru Emoto discovered that crystals formed in frozen water reveal changes when specific, concentrated thoughts are directed toward them. He found that water from clear springs and water that has been exposed to loving words shows brilliant, complex, and colorful snowflake patterns. In contrast, polluted water, or water exposed to negative thoughts, forms incomplete, asymmetrical patterns with dull colors. The implications of this research create a new awareness of how we can positively impact the earth and our personal health.",

    "description": "Bestselling novelist Margaret George brings to life the glittering kingdom of Cleopatra, Queen of the Nile, in this lush, sweeping, and richly detailed saga. Told in Cleopatra's own voice, this is a mesmerizing tale of ambition, passion, and betrayal, which begins when the twenty-year-old queen seeks out the most powerful man in the world, Julius Caesar, and does not end until, having survived the assassination of Caesar and the defeat of the second man she loves, Marc Antony, she plots her own death rather than be paraded in triumph through the streets of Rome. <br />Most of all, in its richness and authenticity, it is an irresistible story that reveals why Margaret George's work has been widely acclaimed as \"the best kind of historical novel, one the reader can't wait to get lost in.\"<br />",

    "description": "<i>War and Peace</i>, by <b>Leo Tolstoy</b>, is part of the <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i><i>\u00a0</i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i>:<br />All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics </i>pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.<br /><br />\u00a0<br />The most famous\u2014and perhaps greatest\u2014novel of all time, <b>Tolstoy</b>\u2019s <i>War and Peace</i> tells the story of five families struggling for survival during Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Russia.<br />\u00a0<br />Among its many unforgettable characters is Prince Andrey Bolkonsky, a proud, dashing man who, despising the artifice of high society, joins the army to achieve glory.\u00a0 Badly wounded at Austerlitz, he begins to discover the emptiness of everything to which he has devoted himself.\u00a0 His death scene is considered one of the greatest passages in Russian literature.<br />\u00a0<br />The novel's other hero, the bumbling Pierre Bezukhov, tries to find meaning in life through a series of philosophical systems that promise to resolve all questions. He at last discovers the Tolstoyan truth that wisdom is to be found not in systems but in the ordinary processes of daily life, especially in his marriage to the novel's most memorable heroine, Natasha.<br />\u00a0<br />Both an intimate study of individual passions and an epic history of Russia and its people, <i>War and Peace</i> is nothing more or less than a complete portrait of human existence.<br /><br /><b></b>\u00a0<br /><br /><b>Joseph Frank</b> is Professor Emeritus of Comparative Literature at Princeton University and Professor Emeritus of Comparative Literature and Slavic Languages and Literature at Stanford University. He is the author of a five-volume study of Dostoevsky\u2019s life and work.",

    "description": "Jan Wong, a Canadian of Chinese descent, went to China as a starry-eyed Maoist in 1972 at the height of the Cultural Revolution. A true believer--and one of only two Westerners permitted to enroll at Beijing University--her education included wielding a pneumatic drill at the Number One Machine Tool Factory. In the name of the Revolution, she renounced rock &amp; roll, hauled pig manure in the paddy fields, and turned in a fellow student who sought her help in getting to the United States. She also met and married the only American draft dodger from the Vietnam War to seek asylum in China.<br /><br /><i>Red China Blues</i> is Wong's startling--and ironic--memoir of her rocky six-year romance with Maoism (which crumbled as she became aware of the harsh realities of Chinese communism); her dramatic firsthand account of the devastating Tiananmen Square uprising; and her engaging portrait of the individuals and events she covered as a correspondent in China during the tumultuous era of capitalist reform under Deng Xiaoping. In a frank, captivating, deeply personal narrative she relates the horrors that led to her disillusionment with the \"worker's paradise.\" And through the stories of the people--an unhappy young woman who was sold into marriage, China's most famous dissident, a doctor who lengthens penises--Wong reveals long-hidden dimensions of the world's most populous nation.<br /><br />In setting out to show readers in the Western world what life is like in China, and why we should care, she reacquaints herself with the old friends--and enemies of her radical past, and comes to terms with the legacy of her ancestral homeland.",

    "description": "A novel of courage, hope and love...<br /><br />From her secret perch at the top of the stairs, seven-year-old Gabriella watches the guests arrive at her parents' lavish Manhattan home. The click, click click of her mother's high heels strikes terror into her heart, as she has been told that she is to blame for her mother's rage - and her father's failure to protect her. Her world is a confusing blend of terror, betrayal and pain, and Gabriella knows that there is no safe place for her to hide.<br /><br />When her parents' marriage collapses, her father disappears and her mother abandons her to a convent, where Gabriella's battered body and soul begin to mend amid the quiet safety and hushed rituals of the nuns. And when she grows into womanhood, young Father Joe Connors comes into her life. Like Gabriella, Joe is haunted by the pain of his childhood, and with her he takes the first steps towards healing. But their relationship leads to disaster as Joe must choose between the priesthood and Gabriella. She struggles to survive on her own in New York, where she seeks escape through her writing, until eventually she is able to find forgiveness, freedom from guilt, and healing from abuse.<br /><br />In this work of daring and compassion, Danielle Steel has created a vivid portrait of an abused child's broken world which will shock and move you to your very soul.",

A calliope's shrill siren song beckons to all with a seductive promise of dreams and youth regained. In this season of dying, Cooger &amp; Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show has come to Green Town, Illinois, to destroy every life touched by its strange and sinister mystery. And two inquisitive boys standing precariously on the brink of adulthood will soon discover the secret of the satanic raree-show's smoke, mazes, and mirrors, as they learn all too well the heavy cost of wishes - and the stuff of nightmare.",

Eight costumed boys running to meet their friend Pipkin at the haunted house outside town encounter instead the huge and cadaverous Mr. Moundshroud. As Pipkin scrambles to join them, he is swept away by a dark Something, and Moundshroud leads the boys on the tail of a kite through time and space to search the past for their friend and the meaning of Halloween. After witnessing a funeral procession in ancient Egypt, cavemen discovering fire, Druid rites, the persecution of witches in the Dark Ages, and the gargoyles of Notre Dame, they catch up with the elusive Pipkin in the catacombs of Mexico, where each boy gives one year from the end of his life to save Pipkin's. Enhanced by appropriately haunting black-and-white drawings.\"--Booklist",

He examines the major developments in Western philosophical thought on the nature of reality, at each of three levels - social, perceptual and physical. (Do money, colour, or photons exist?) The book systematically investigates these levels, peeling away the assumptions we make about those parts of reality that we take for granted.",

    "description": "In 1975 Annie Dillard took up residence on an island in Puget Sound in a wooded room furnished with \"one enormous window, one cat, one spider and one person.\" For the next two years she asked herself questions about time, reality, sacrifice death, and the will of God. In <em>Holy the Firm</em> she writes about a moth consumed in a candle flame, about a seven-year-old girl burned in an airplane accident, about a baptism on a cold beach. But behind the moving curtain of what she calls \"the hard things -- rock mountain and salt sea,\" she sees, sometimes far off and sometimes as close by as a veil or air, the power play of holy fire.<br /><br />This is a profound book about the natural world -- both its beauty and its cruelty -- the Pulitzer Prize-winning Dillard knows so well.",

    "description": "My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973. My murderer was a man from our neighborhood. My mother liked his border flowers, and my father talked to him once about fertilizer.<br /><br />This is Susie Salmon, speaking from heaven - which looks a lot like her school playground, with the good kind of swing sets, counsellors to help newcomers adjust, and friends to room with. Everything Susie wants appears as soon as she thinks of it - except the one thing she wants most: to be back with the people she loved on earth.<br /><br />Watching from her place in heaven, Susie sees her happy, suburban family devastated by her death, isolated even from one another as they each try to cope with their terrible loss alone. Over the years, her friends and siblings grow up, fall in love, do all the things she never had the chance to do herself. But life is not quite finished with Susie yet ...",

    "description": "A glorious fiction debut written with exceptional acuity by an award-winning twenty-five-year-old Thai-American writer. Read a complete short story at BookBrowse.<br /><br />Sightseeing is a masterful new work of fiction, a collection of stories set in contemporary Thailand and written with a grace and sophistication that belie the age of its young author. These are generous, tender tales of family bonds, youthful romance, generational conflicts, and cultural shiftings beneath the glossy surface of a warm, Edenic setting. Rattawut Lapcharoensap offers a diverse, humorous, and deeply affectionate view of life in a small Southeast Asian country that is inevitably absorbing the waves of encroaching Westernization.<br /><br />In the prizewinning opening story, \"Farangs,\" the young son of a modest beachside motel owner commits the cardinal sin of falling for a pretty tourist, and the confrontation that ensues between the native boy and the girl's pompous American boyfriend culminates wondrously amid flying mangoes and Clint Eastwood\u2014a pet pig\u2014swimming out to sea. In \"Sightseeing,\" the much-anticipated holiday of a young man about to leave for college and his loving and fiercely independent mother becomes a different kind of pilgrimage altogether when they are forced to confront the mother's impending blindness. The concluding novella, \"Cockfighter,\" is a triumph of storytelling in which a young girl witnesses her proud father's valiant but foolhardy and drawn-out battle against the local delinquent and violent hoodlum whose family's vicious stranglehold on the villagers has passed down unchecked through generations.<br /><br />Through his vivid assemblage of parents and children, natives and transients, ardent lovers and sworn enemies, Lapcharoensap dares us to look with new eyes at the circumstances that shape our views and the prejudices that form our blind spots. Gorgeous and lush, painful and candid, Sightseeing is an extraordinary reading experience, one that powerfully reveals that when it comes to how we respond to pain, anger, hurt, and love, no place is too far from home.",

    "description": "Call Me by Your Name is the story of a sudden and powerful romance that blossoms between an adolescent boy and a summer guest at his parents' cliff-side mansion on the Italian Riviera. Unprepared for the consequences of their attraction, at first each feigns indifference. But during the restless summer weeks that follow, unrelenting buried currents of obsession and fear, fascination and desire, intensify their passion as they test the charged ground between them. What grows from the depths of their spirits is a romance of scarcely six weeks' duration and an experience that marks them for a lifetime. For what the two discover on the Riviera and during a sultry evening in Rome is the one thing both already fear they may never truly find again: total intimacy.<br /><br />The psychological maneuvers that accompany attraction have seldom been more shrewdly captured than in Andr\u00e9 Aciman's frank, unsentimental, heartrending elegy to human passion. Call Me by Your Name is clear-eyed, bare-knuckled, and ultimately unforgettable.",

    "description": "John D. Rockefeller, Sr.--history's first billionaire and the patriarch of America's most famous dynasty--is an icon whose true nature has eluded three generations of historians. Now Ron Chernow, the National Book Award-winning biographer of the Morgan and Warburg banking families, gives us a history of the mogul \"etched with uncommon objectivity and literary grace . . . as detailed, balanced, and psychologically insightful a portrait of the tycoon as we may ever have\" (Kirkus Reviews). Titan is the first full-length biography based on unrestricted access to Rockefeller's exceptionally rich trove of papers. A landmark publication full of startling revelations, the book will indelibly alter our image of this most enigmatic capitalist.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Born the son of a flamboyant, bigamous snake-oil salesman and a pious, straitlaced mother, Rockefeller rose from rustic origins to become the world's richest man by creating America's most powerful and feared monopoly, Standard Oil. Branded \"the Octopus\" by legions of muckrakers, the trust refined and marketed nearly 90 percent of the oil produced in America.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rockefeller was likely the most controversial businessman in our nation's history. Critics charged that his empire was built on unscrupulous tactics: grand-scale collusion with the railroads, predatory pricing, industrial espionage, and wholesale bribery of political officials. The titan spent more than thirty years dodging investigations until Teddy Roosevelt and his trustbusters embarked on a marathon crusade to bring Standard Oil to bay.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While providing abundant new evidence of Rockefeller's misdeeds, Chernow discards the stereotype of the cold-blooded monster to sketch an unforgettably human portrait of a quirky, eccentric original. A devout Baptist and temperance advocate, Rockefeller gave money more generously--his chosen philanthropies included the Rockefeller Foundation, the University of Chicago, and what is today Rockefeller University--than anyone before him. Titan presents a finely nuanced portrait of a fascinating, complex man, synthesizing his public and private lives and disclosing numerous family scandals, tragedies, and misfortunes that have never before come to light.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0John D. Rockefeller's story captures a pivotal moment in American history, documenting the dramatic post-Civil War shift from small business to the rise of giant corporations that irrevocably transformed the nation. With cameos by Joseph Pulitzer, William Randolph Hearst, Jay Gould, William Vanderbilt, Ida Tarbell, Andrew Carnegie, Carl Jung, J. Pierpont Morgan, William James, Henry Clay Frick, Mark Twain, and Will Rogers, Titan turns Rockefeller's life into a vivid tapestry of American society in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is Ron Chernow's signal triumph that he narrates this monumental saga with all the sweep, drama, and insight that this giant subject deserves.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

Murderously urbane, it depicts the breakup of a marriage in the London gentry, where the errant wife suffers from terminal boredom, and becomes enamoured of a social parasite and professional luncheon-goer.",

    "description": "First published in 1922, <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i> followed Fitzgerald's impeccable debut, <i>This Side of Paradise,</i> thus securing his place in the tradition of great American novelists. Embellished with the author's lyrical prose, here is the story of Harvard-educated, aspiring aesthete Anthony Patch and his beautiful wife, Gloria. As they await the inheritance of his grandfather's fortune, their reckless marriage sways under the influence of alcohol and avarice. A devastating look at the nouveau riche, and the New York nightlife, as well as the ruinous effects of wild ambition, <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i> achieved stature as one of Fitzgerald's most accomplished novels. Its distinction as a classic endures to this day. Pocket Book's Enriched Classics present the great works of world literature enhanced for the contemporary reader. Special features include critical perspectives, suggestions for further read, and a unique visual essay composed of period photographs that help bring every word to life.",

    "description": "In this timeless tale of two mortal princesses- one beautiful and one unattractive- C.S. Lewis reworks the classical myth of Cupid and Psyche into an enduring piece of contemporary fiction. This is the story of Orual, Psyche's embittered and ugly older sister, who posessively and harmfully loves Psyche. Much to Orual's frustration, Psyche is loved by Cupid, the god of love himself, setting the troubled Orual on a path of moral development.<br /><br />Set against the backdrop of Glome, a barbaric, pre-Christian world, the struggles between sacred and profane love are illuminated as Orual learns that we cannot understand the intent of the gods \"till we have faces\" and sincerity in our souls and selves.",

    "description": "George Perec produced some of the most entertaining and spirited essays of his age, and <i>Species of Spaces and Other Pieces </i>is edited and translated from the French with an introduction by John Sturrock in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />Georges Perec, author of <i>Life: A User's Manual</i>, was one of the most surprising and enjoyable of all modern French writers. The pieces in this volume show him to be at times playful, more serious at other, but writing always with the lightest of touches. He had the keenest of eyes for the 'infra-ordinary', the things we do every day - eating, sleeping, working - and the places we do them in without giving them a moment's thought. But behind the lightness and humour, there is also the sadness of a French Jewish boy who lost his parents in the Second World War and found comfort in the material world around him, and above all in writing.<br /><br />This volume contains a selection of Georges Perec's non-fiction works, along with a charming short story, 'The Winter Journey'. It includes notes and an introduction describing Perec's life and career.<br /><br />Georges Perec (1936-1982) was born in Paris, the son of Polish Jews. After his father was killed in the Army, and his mother deported to Auschwitz where she later died, Perec was adopted by his aunt and uncle. Working for most of his life as an archivist, Perec was one of the most important post-war French novelists. He is best remembered as the author of <i>Life, A User's Manual</i> and <i>The Void</i>, a novel which does not use the letter 'e'.<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>Species of Spaces</i>, you might also like Susan Sontag's <i>Against Interpretation and Other Essays,</i> available in Penguin Modern Classics.<br /><br />'One of the most significant literary personalities in the world'<br />Italo Calvino",

    "description": "Tristessa is the name with which Kerouac baptized Esperanza Villanueva, a Catholic Mexican young woman, a prostitute and addict to certain drugs, whom he fell in love with during one of his stays in Mexico -a country that he frequently visited - by the middle of the fifties. Wrapped in a spiritual atmosphere that expresses the yearnings of Kerouac to find himself, \"Tristessa\", translated by Jorge Garc\u00eda- Robles, a specialist in the beat generation, is the story of the strange loving relationship that the author had with Esperanza, as well as the significant description of the atmosphere that surrounded it, which depicts some key places of Mexico City back then.Hero of the beat generation, the creator of a model of life that would be followed by thousands of young people in the entire world, a sui generis mystic, \"Tristessa\", which until recently was not known in Spanish and that was published in English, is one of his fresher and better achieved works. <br /><br />Tristessa es el nombre con el que Kerouac bautiz\u00f3 a Esperanza Villanueva, una joven mexicana cat\u00f3lica, prostituta y adicta a ciertas drogas, de quien se enamor\u00f3 durante una de sus estancias en M\u00e9xico, pa\u00eds que visitaba con frecuencia, a mediados de los a\u00f1os cincuenta. Tristessa, en la traducci\u00f3n de Jorge Garc\u00eda- Robles, especialista en la generaci\u00f3n beat, es el relato de la extra\u00f1a relaci\u00f3n amorosa que tuvo con Esperanza, as\u00ed como la significativa descripci\u00f3n del ambiente que la rodeaba, en la que aparecen retratos de algunos lugares clave de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico: Plaza Garibaldi, Ni\u00f1o Perdido, la colonia Roma. Escritor \u00abal rojo vivo\u00bb, como lo calific\u00f3 Henry Miller, h\u00e9roe de la generaci\u00f3n beat, creador de un modelo de vida que seguir\u00edan miles de j\u00f3venes en todo el mundo, m\u00edstico sui g\u00e9neris, Tristessa, que hasta hace poco no se conoc\u00eda en espa\u00f1ol y que se public\u00f3 en ingl\u00e9s apenas hace diez a\u00f1os, es una de sus obras m\u00e1s frescas y mejor logradas.",

    "description": "This early autobiography, which takes Dal\u00ed through his late thirties, is as startling and unpredictable as his art. On its first publication, the reviewer of Books observed: \"It is impossible not to admire this painter as writer ... (Dal\u00ed) succeeds in doing exactly what he sets out to do ... communicates the snobbishness, self-adoration, comedy, seriousness, fanaticism, in short the concept of life and the total picture of himself he sets out to portray.\" Superbly illustrated with over eighty photographs of Dal\u00ed and his works, and scores of Dal\u00ed drawings and sketches.",

In desperation he returns to his boyhood home, his grandparents' farm in rural Vermont, now occupied by his cousin Pamela and her family. But Eric's solace is short-lived. Something terrible is going on in the woods nearby; its center seems to be a mysterious stone structure. The mystery deepens as people begin to vanish. As baffling incidents continue, it becomes harder to deny that a powerful malevolent force is at work in the Green Mountains. Eric must confront a reality he can neither accept not deny.",

    "description": "Axel Vander is an old man, in ill health, recently widowed, a scholar renowned for both his unquestionable authority and the ferocity and violence that often mark his conduct. He is known to be Belgian by birth, to have had a privileged upbringing, to have made a perilous escape from World War II\u2013torn Europe\u2014his blind eye and dead leg are indelible reminders of that time. But Vander is also a master liar (\u201cI lied to lie\u201d), his true identity shrouded under countless layers of intricately connected falsehoods. Now a young woman he doesn\u2019t know, and whom he has dubbed \u201cMiss Nemesis,\u201d has threatened to expose the most fundamental and damaging of these lies. Vander has agreed to travel from California to meet her in Italy\u2014in Turin, city of the most mysterious shroud\u2014believing that he will have no difficulty rendering her harmless.<br />But he is wrong. This woman\u2014at once mad and brilliant, generous and demanding\u2014will be the catalyst for Vander\u2019s reluctant journey through his past toward the truths he has hidden, and toward others even he will be shocked to discover.<br />In <i>Shroud</i>\u2014as in all of his acclaimed previous novels\u2014John Banville gives us an emotionally resonant tale, exceptionally rich in language and image, dazzling in its narrative invention. It is a work of uncommon power.",

    "description": "A heartrending new book -- the story of a marriage and the story of two lives -- from the author of the international bestselling novel A Suitable Boy <br /><br />Shanti Behari Seth was born on the eighth day of the eighth month in the eighth year of the twentieth century; he died two years before its close. He was brought up in India in the apparently vigorous but dying Raj and was sent by his family in the 1930s to Berlin -- though he could not speak a word of German -- to study medicine and dentistry. It was here, before he migrated to Britain, that Shanti's path first crossed that of his future wife. <br /><br />Helga Gerda Caro, known to everyone as \"Henny\" was also born in 1908, in Berlin, to a Jewish family -- cultured, patriotic, and intensely German. When the family decided to take Shanti as a lodger, Henny's first reaction was, \"Don't take the black man!\" But a friendship flowered, and when Henny fled Hitler's Germany for England just one month before war broke out, she was met at Victoria Station by the only person in the country she knew: Shanti. <br /><br />Vikram Seth has woven together their astonishing story, which recounts the arrival into this childless couple's lives of their great-nephew from India -- the teenage student Vikram Seth. The result is an extraordinary tapestry of India, the Third Reich and the Second World War, Auschwitz and the Holocaust, Israel and Palestine, postwar Germany and 1970s Britain. <br /><br />Two Lives is both a history of a violent century seen through the eyes of two survivors and an intimate portrait of their friendship, marriage, and abiding yet complex love. Part biography, part memoir, part meditation on our times, this is the true tale of two remarkable lives -- a masterful telling from one of our greatest living writers.",

    "description": "When Gerald was a child he was fascinated by fire. But fire is dangerous and powerful, and tragedy strikes. His substance-addicted mother is taken from him. Then he loses the loving generosity of a favorite aunt. A brutal stepfather with a flaming temper and an evil secret makes his life miserable. The one bright light in Gerald's life is his little half sister, Angel, whom he struggles to protect from her father, Jordan Sparks, who abuses her, and from their mother, whose irresponsible behavior forces Gerald to work hard to keep the family together. As a teenager, Gerald finds success as a member of the Hazelwood Tigers basketball team, while Angel develops her talents as a dancer. Trouble still haunts them, however, and Gerald learns, painfully, that young friends can die and old enemies must be faced. In the end he must stand up to his stepfather alone in a blazing confrontation.<br /><br />Sharon M. Draper has interwoven characters and events from her previous novel, Tears of a Tiger, in this unflinchingly realistic portrayal of poverty and child abuse. It is an inspiring story of a young man who rises above the tragic circumstances of his life by drawing on the love and strength of family and friends.",

    "description": "Thirteen passengers are stranded at an airport. Tokyo, their destination, is covered in snow and all flights are cancelled. To pass the night they form a huddle by the silent baggage carousels and tell one another stories. Thus begins Rana Dasgupta's Canterbury Tales for our times.<br />In the spirit of Borges and Calvino, Dasgupta's writing combines an energetically modern landscape with a timeless, beguiling fairy-tale ethos, while bringing to life a cast of extraordinary individuals-some lost, some confused, some happy-in a world that remains ineffable, inexplicable, and wonderful.<br />A Ukrainian merchant is led by a wingless bird back to a lost lover; Robert De Niro's son masters the transubstantiation of matter and turns it against his enemies; a man who manipulates other people's memories has to confront his own past; a Japanese entrepreneur risks losing everything in his obsession with a doll; a mute Turkish girl is left alone in the house of a German man who is mapping the world.<br />Told by people on a journey, these are stories about lives in transit, stories that grow into an epic cycle about the hopes and dreams and disappointments that connect people everywhere.",

    "description": "An Arab and a Jew open a restaurant together across the street from the United Nations\u2026<br /><br />It sounds like the beginning of an ethnic joke, but it\u2019s the axis around which spins Tom Robbins\u2019s gutsy, fun-loving, and alarmingly provocative new novel, in which a bean can philosophizes, a dessert spoon mystifies, a young waitress takes on the New York art world, and a rowdy redneck welder discovers the lost god of Palestine\u2014while the illusions that obscure humanity\u2019s view of the true universe fall away, one by one, like Salome\u2019s veils. <br /><b><br />Skinny Legs and All</b> deals, in Robbins\u2019s audacious manner, with today\u2019s most sensitive issues: race, politics, marriage, art, religion, money, and lust. It weaves lyrically through what some call the \u201cend days of our planet. Refusing to avert its gaze from the horrors of the apocalypse, it also refuses to let the alleged end of the world spoil its mood. And its mood is defiantly upbeat.<br /><br />In the gloriously inventive Tom Robbins style, here are characters, phrases, stories, and ideas that dance together on the page, wild and sexy, like Salome herself. <br /><br />Or was it Jezebel?",

Gordon alone survived. And forgave. He said of the bombers, ' I have lost my daughter, but I bear no grudge . . . I shall pray, tonight and every night, that God will forgive them.' His words caught the media's ears \u0097 and out of one man's grief, the world got a glimpse of grace. Grace is the church's great distinctive. It's the one thing the world cannot duplicate, and the one thing it craves above all else \u0097 for only grace can bring hope and transformation to a jaded world. <p>In <cite>What's So Amazing About Grace?</cite> award-winning author Philip Yancey explores grace at street level. If grace is God's love for the undeserving, he asks, then what does it look like in action? And if Christians are its sole dispensers, then how are we doing at lavishing grace on a world that knows far more of cruelty and unforgiveness than it does of mercy? Yancey sets grace in the midst of life's stark images, tests its mettle against horrific 'ungrace.' Can grace survive in the midst of such atrocities as the Nazi holocaust? Can it triumph over the brutality of the Ku Klux Klan? Should any grace at all be shown to the likes of Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed and cannibalized seventeen young men? Grace does not excuse sin, says Yancey, but it treasures the sinner. True grace is shocking, scandalous. It shakes our conventions with its insistence on getting close to sinners and touching them with mercy and hope. It forgives the unfaithful spouse, the racist, the child abuser. It loves today's AIDS-ridden addict as much as the tax collector of Jesus' day. </p><p>In his most personal and provocative book ever, Yancey offers compelling, true portraits of grace's life-changing power. He searches for its presence in his own life and in the church. He asks, How can Christians contend graciously with moral issues that threaten all they hold dear? And he challenges us to become living answers to a world that desperately wants to know, <cite>What's So Amazing About Grace?</cite></p>",

It is certainly the funniest.<br /><br />Tom Jones, the hero of the book, is introduced to the reader as the ward of a liberal Somerset squire. Tom is a generous but slightly wild and feckless country boy with a weakness for young women. Misfortune, followed by many spirited adventures as he travels to London to seek his fortune, teach him a sort of wisdom to go with his essential good-heartedness.<br /><br />This 'comic, epic poem in prose' will make the modern reader laugh as much as it did his forbears. Its biting satire finds an echo in today's society, for as Doris Lessing recently remarked 'This country becomes every day more like the eighteenth century, full of thieves and adventurers, rogues and a robust, unhypocritical savagery side-by-side with people lecturing others on morality'.",

    "description": "Sometimes I feel like I have walked into the middle of a movie. Maybe I can make my own movie. The film will be the story of my life. No, not my life, but of this experience. I'll call it what the lady who is the prosecutor called me. <i>Monster.<br /><br />Fade In: Interior Court. A guard sits at a desk behind Steve. Kathy O'Brien, Steve's lawyer, is all business as she talks to Steve.<br /><br />O'Brien<br />Let me make sure you understand what's going on. Both you and this king character are on trial for felony murder. Felony Murder is as serious as it gets. . . . When you're in court, you sit there and pay attetion. You let the jury know that you think the case is a serious as they do. . . .<br /><br />Steve<br />You think we're going to win ?<br /><br />O'Brien (seriously)<br />It probably depends on what you mean by \"win.\"</i><br /><br />Sixteen-year-old Steve Harmon is on trial for murder. A Harlem drugstore owner was shot and killed in his store, and the word is that Steve served as the lookout.<br /><br />Guilty or innocent, Steve becomes a pawn in the hands of \"the system,\" cluttered with cynical authority figures and unscrupulous inmates, who will turn in anyone to shorten their own sentences. For the first time, Steve is forced to think about who he is as he faces prison, where he may spend all the tomorrows of his life.<br /><br />As a way of coping with the horrific events that entangle him, Steve, an amateur filmmaker, decides to transcribe his trial into a script, just like in the movies. He writes it all down, scene by scene, the story of how his whole life was turned around in an instant. But despite his efforts, reality is blurred and his vision obscured until he can no longer tell who he is or what is the truth. This compelling novel is Walter Dean Myers's writing at its best.",

Maybe that question leads you to ask \"What does it even mean to be in Jesus' presence?\" In <i>How to Worship Jesus Christ</i>, Joseph Carroll explains what it means to enter Christ's presence and that it is something available to every Christian - through true worship.<br /><br />There is much more to truly worshipping Jesus than simply church services and personal devotions. True worship requires complete commitment of emotions, intellect, and will, but the reward is great. Carroll points the reader into the presence of Christ by teaching practical steps of personal worship. He also draws on the habits and experiences of some of history's greatest saints to serve as examples and guides.<br /><br />This deeply practical and personal book will help you know Jesus more intimately on a daily basis. It will draw readers close to Christ in a real way, to experience His presence, and to worship Him in ways far better than what most imagine to be possible.",

The Saxon fortress of Leosan is under the almost unheard-of rule of a woman. The Gerefa of the fortress has become a monk, leaving his sister, Ranegonda, to rule in his name as best she can--and to deal with his embittered, headstrong wife as well. Into this tense and dire situation comes Saint-Germain. Shipwrecked on the Baltic shore, near the true death, he is found by Ranegonda, whom he will come to love for the gift of blood she gives him, and for her own indomitable spirit.",

The special books in this collection are based on certain groups of people, such as Inventors and Authors. These books are a spin-off of the Horrible Histories collection and are published by the same company, Scholastic; however, many different authors and illustrators work on these books. The books are aimed at 7-14 year olds, and have sold many copies around the world, especially in the UK. The books often contain journals and newspapers which show what life would have been like at that time. These are almost always created by the author him/herself, but are shown as have been created by the person whom the book is about.",

    "description": "Measured at the staggering amount of $5.1 trillion (and growing every day) the national debt is unfathomable to most Americans. What we may not realize is that the United States was born out of debt. After the Revolution, the brilliant Alexander Hamilton was less interested in paying down the Revolutionary war debt than in using it to create a vibrant national economy. \"If it is not excessive, \" he declared, \"a national debt will be to us a national blessing.\" In a fascinating narrative brimming with colorful characters, historical accidents, and American ingenuity, business historian John Steele Gordon leads us on a tour of an American institution whose largely unknown story has been integrally entwined with our country's destiny. At key points in U.S. history, Gordon shows how the national debt has been a potent instrument of fiscal policy in keeping the world safe for democracy. But how much debt is too much? At a time when we despair of balancing even a single year's budget, Hamilton's Blessing provides much needed perspective - and hope. Author writes the \"Business of America\" column in American Heritage magazine and is heard often on public radio's \"Marketplace.\"",

    "description": "\"Is God listening? and Can He be trusted?\" In this book, Yancey tackles the questions caused by a God who doesn't always do what we think he's supposed to do.<br /><br />Philip Yancey has a gift for articulating the knotty issues of faith. In Disappointment with God, he poses three questions that Christians wonder but seldom ask aloud: Is God unfair? Is he silent? Is he hidden? This insightful and deeply personal book points to the odd disparity between our concept of God and the realities of life. Why, if God is so hungry for relationship with us, does he seem so distant? Why, if he cares for us, do bad things happen? What can we expect from him after all? Yancey answers these questions with clarity, richness, and biblical assurance. He takes us beyond the things that make for disillusionment to a deeper faith, a certitude of God's love, and a thirst to reach not just for what God gives, but for who he is.",

    "description": "Philip Yancey helps reveal what two thousand years of history covered up<br /><br />What happens when a respected Christian journalist decides to put his preconceptions aside and take a long look at the Jesus described in the Gospels? How does the Jesus of the New Testament compare to the new, rediscovered Jesus or even the Jesus we think we know so well?<br /><br />Philip Yancey offers a new and different perspective on the life of Christ and his work, his teachings, his miracles, his death and resurrection and ultimately, who he was and why he came. From the manger in Bethlehem to the cross in Jerusalem, Yancey presents a complex character who generates questions as well as answers; a disturbing and exhilarating Jesus who wants to radically transform your life and stretch your faith.<br /><br />The Jesus I Never Knew uncovers a Jesus who is brilliant, creative, challenging, fearless, compassionate, unpredictable, and ultimately satisfying. \u2019No one who meets Jesus ever stays the same\u2019, says Yancey. \u2018Jesus has rocked my own preconceptions and has made me ask hard questions about why those of us who bear his name don t do a better job of following him.\u2019",

When that past reaches out for her in a particularly horrifying fashion, he vows revenge and, assembling all of his old skills, sets out to track down the men responsible, before it can happen again.<p>At the same time, the Pentagon is readying an operation to rescue a key group of prisoners in a North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp. One man, they find, knows the terrain around the camp better than anyone else they have: a certain former Navy SEAL named John Kelly.</p><p>Kelly has his own mission. The Pentagon wants him for theirs. Attempting to juggle the two, Kelly (now code-named Mr. Clark) finds himself confronted by a vast array of enemies, both at home and abroad - men so skillful that the slightest misstep means death. And the fate of dozens of people, including Kelly himself, rests on his making sure that misstep never happens.</p><p>Men aren't born dangerous. They grow dangerous. And the most dangerous of all, Kelly learns, are the ones you least expect...<br />As Clancy takes us through the twists and turns of Without Remorse, he blends the exceptional realism and authenticity that are his hallmarks with intricate plotting, knife-edge suspense and a remarkable cast of characters.</p>",

    "description": "Elizabeth and Betsy had been school friends in 1950s London. Elizabeth, prudent and introspective, values social propriety. Betsy, raised by a spinster aunt, is open, trusting, and desperate for affection. After growing up and going their separate ways, the two women reconnect later in life. Elizabeth has married kind but tedious Digby, while Betsy is still searching for love and belonging. In this deeply perceptive story, Anita Brookner brilliantly charts the resilience of a friendship tested by alienation and by jealousy over a man who seems to offer the promise of escape.",

Also introduced in this collection is the mysterious ninja brotherhood, The Hand, the group that will ultimately cause Elektra's untimely demise.<br /><br />The stories included in the volume dedicated to Frank Miller's classic work show the continued development of an artistic legend as his skills continued to grow in stature and depth.",

They ring with the unmistakable clarity of genius, with majesty of language, splendor and wealth of detail, and with the deep conviction of a powerful mind. Milton's masterpieces reflect the light of a many-faceted tradition; the intellectual freedom of Greek classicism, the moral passion of Hebrew prophets, the Protestant sense of an abiding religious belief.<br /><p>Here is the ageless art, vital throughout the centuries, of the Puritan who undertook to \"explain the ways of God to man.\"<br /></p><p>The new annotations for this Mentor edition include the more interesting textual variations of the poems; and record, for the first time in any edition, the far-flung repetitions of phrases, and the scattered fixed epithets, within (and between) <i>Paradise Lost</i> and <i>Samson Agonistes.</i></p>",

But after sweeping her school and district spelling bees, Eliza suddenly finds herself center stage, no longer living in the shadows of underachievement. Not merely a coming-of-age story, Goldberg's first novel delicately examines the unraveling fabric of one family. The outcome of this tale is as startling and unconventional as the writing, which wields its metaphors sharply and rings with maturity. Goldberg's debut marks the arrival of an extraordinarily talented new writer.",

    "description": "In Madrid in 1868, fencing master and man of honor Don Jaime is approached by a mysterious woman who seeks to learn the unstoppable thrust, an arcane technique known only to him. All too soon he finds himself in the vortex of a plot that includes seduction, secret political documents, and more than one murder. Rich with historical detail of a decaying world that agonizes - as does the art of fencing itself - over the ideals of honor and chivalry, <i>The Fencing Master</i> is superb literature and a true page-turner.",

Told in a voice that reads like the intimate diary of a young woman about to take life on full throttle, this wonderful debut novel chronicles Andrea's jittery journey from suburban mall to Portland's thriving underground rock scene - and back again, as she discovers sex, betrayal, and even love. A Catcher in the Rye for the \"Grunge\" generation, this instant classic will speak to anyone who has ever had to choose between the suffocation of conformity and the perils of rebellion.",

    "description": "In The Red Pony, John Steinbeck's celebration of the spirit and courage of adolescence, we meet Jody Tiflin. Like most ten-year-old boys, Jody feels the urge for rebellion as well as the need to be loved. In these stories, Jody begins to learn about adulthood - its pains, its responsibilities and its problems - through the acceptance of his father's gifts. First he is given a red pony and later he is promised the colt of a bay mare. But both these gifts bring tragedy as well as joy, and Jody not only learns some harsh lessons about life (and death), but is also made painfully aware of the fallibility of adults.",

    "description": "Two ebullient young men search for Truth the Zen way: from marathon wine-drinking bouts, poetry jam sessions, and \"yabyum\" in San Francisco's Bohemia to solitude in the high Sierras and a vigil atop Desolation Peak in Washington State. Published just a year after On the Road put the Beat Generation on the map, The Dharma Bums is sparked by Kerouac's expansiveness, humor, and a contagious zest for life. <br /><br />One of the best and most popular of Kerouac's autobiographical novels, The Dharma Bums is based on experiences the writer had during the mid-1950s while living in California, after he'd become interested in Buddhism's spiritual mode of understanding. One of the book's main characters, Japhy Ryder, is based on the real poet Gary Snyder, who was a close friend and whose interest in Buddhism influenced Kerouac",

    "description": "In the outer reaches of a country recently torn apart by civil war lives a small Christian sect and its enigmatic leader, Balashov. Anna Petrovna, a beautiful, restless photographer, is raising her young son by herself amid this brutal landscape. Stationed nearby is a company of Czech soldiers, desperate to get home but on the losing side of the recent conflict. Each soldier lives in a fragile co-existence and a troubling uncertainty prevails. Into this isolated community trudges Samarin, an escapee from Russia's northernmost prison camp. Immediately apprehended, he is brought before Captain Matula, the Czech company's megalomaniac commander. But the stranger's appearance has caught the attention of others, including that of Anna Petrovna. And when a local shaman is found murdered, suspicion and terror engulf this village. To be published in twenty countries, <i>The People's Act of Love</i> is quite simply magnificent storytelling and it promises to be an auspicious literary event.",

    "description": "<i>Sodom and Gomorrah</i> \u2013 now in a superb translation by John Sturrock \u2013 takes up the theme of homosexual love, male and female, and dwells on how destructive sexual jealousy can be for those who suffer it. Proust's novel is also an unforgiving analysis of both the decadent high society of Paris, and the rise of a philistine bourgeoisie that is on the way to supplanting it. Characters who had lesser roles in earlier volumes now reappear in a different light and take center stage, notably Albertine, with whom the narrator believes he is in love, and also the insanely haughty Baron de Charlus.",

          "description": "With <b>\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu</b> / <b>In Search of Lost Time</b> Proust attempted the perfect rendering of life in art, of the past recreated through memory. It is both a portrait of the artist and a discovery of the aesthetic by which the portrait is painted, and it was to have an immense influence on the literature of the twentieth century.\n    \n    The novel contains seven volumes:\n    <b>1 - Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de chez Swann</b> (1913): Swann's Way / The Way by Swann's\n    (Part I: Combray / Overture. Part II: Un Amour de Swann / Swann in Love. Part III : Noms de pays: le nom / Names of places: the name)\n    <b>2 - \u00c0 l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs</b> (1919): In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower / Within a Budding Grove\n    <b>3 - Le C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Guermantes</b> (1920-1921): The Guermantes Way \n    <b>4 - Sodome et Gomorrhe</b> (1921-1922): Sodom and Gomorrah / Cities of the Plain\n    <b>5 - La Prisonni\u00e8re</b> (1923): The Prisoner / The Captive\n    <b>6 - Albertine disparue / La Fugitive</b> (1925): Albertine Gone / The Fugitive / The Sweet Cheat Gone\n    <b>7 - Le Temps retrouv\u00e9</b> (1927): Time Regained / The Past Recaptured / Finding Time Again\n    \n    The novel is being adapted as a <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/65593-remembrance-of-things-past-graphic-novel-adaptation\">graphic novel</a> by [author:St\u00e9phane Heuet|119580].\n    \n    <b>In Search of Lost Time</b> is Marcel Proust\u2019s masterpiece, known for its length and the notion of involuntary memory, the most famous example being the \"episode of the madeleine\". The complete story contains nearly 1.5 million words and is one of the longest novels in world literature.\n    \n    <b>\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu</b> is translated as:\n    English: In Search of Lost Time / Remembrance of Things Past*\n    Spanish: En busca del tiempo perdido\n    German: Auf der Suche nach der verlorenen Zeit\n    Portugese: Em Busca do Tempo Perdido\n    Italian: Alla ricerca del tempo perduto\n    Dutch: Op zoek naar de verloren tijd\n    Swedish: P\u00e5 spaning efter den tid som flytt\n    Polish: W poszukiwaniu straconego czasu\n    Turkish: Kay\u0131p Zaman\u0131n \u0130zinde\n    Bulgarian: \u041f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0433\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\n    *In English the novel is widely referred to as <b>Remembrance of Things Past</b> but the title <b>In Search of Lost Time</b>, a literal rendering of the French, has gained in usage since D.J. Enright's adopted it in his 1992 revision of the earlier translation by C.K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin.",

    "description": "A missing manuscript<br />A young woman's voyage of discovery<br />And the curious bookshop where it all begins...<br /><br />In this charming novel about the eccentricities and passions of booksellers and collectors, a captivating young Australian woman takes a job at a vast, chaotic emporium of used and rare books in New York City and finds herself caught up in the search for a lost Melville manuscript.<br /><br />Eighteen years old and completely alone, Rosemary arrives in New York from Tasmania with little more than her love of books and an eagerness to explore the city she\u2019s read so much about. She begins her memorable search for independence with appealing enthusiasm, and the moment she steps into the Arcade bookstore, she knows she has found a home. The gruff owner, Mr. Pike, gives her a job sorting through huge piles of books and helping the rest of the staff\u2014a group as odd and idiosyncratic as the characters in a Dickens novel. There\u2019s Pearl, the loving, motherly transsexual who runs the cash register; Oscar, who organizes the nonfiction section and shares his extensive, eclectic knowledge with Rosemary, but furiously rejects her attempts at a more personal relationship; and Arthur Pick, who supervises the art section and demonstrates a particular interest in photography books featuring naked men.<br /><br />The store manager, Walter Geist, is an albino, a lonely figure even within the world of the Arcade. When Walter\u2019s eyesight begins to fail, Rosemary becomes his assistant. And so it is Rosemary who first reads the letter from someone seeking to \u201cplace\u201d a lost manuscript by Herman Melville. Mentioned in Melville\u2019s personal correspondence but never published, the work is of inestimable value, and proof of its existence brings the simmering ambitions and rivalries of the Arcade staff to a boiling point.<br /><br />Including actual correspondence by Melville, <i>The Secret of Lost Things</i> is at once a literary adventure that captures the excitement of discovering a long-lost manuscript by a towering American writer and an evocative portrait of life in a surprisingly colorful bookstore.",

    "description": "Set in the Latin Quarter of 1840s Paris, Henri Murger's 'La Boheme' creates a stark and colorful record of the boisterous, lean, and sensual world of eternal bohemia. The author, like his character Rudolph, was a dispossessed poet living from hand to mouth while serving his literary apprenticeship in the hustle-and-bustle streets of the artists' quarter. In order to make a little money, Murger created fictional episodes based on his experiences in the heart of Bohemia and sold the first of them in 1847..for 15 francs each...to a small literary magazine entitled 'Le Corsaire.' <br /><br />From this humble beginning, 'La Boheme' has become an undying tribute to true Bohemians or, as Murger describes them, 'those called by art.' the episodes first published in 'Le corsaire' were gathered into a book that sold 70,000 copies. then in 1849 Theodore Barriere made the story into a play, which became a popular sensation in Paris. And finally Giacomo Puccini transformed Murger's tale into the famous opera. <br /><br />'La Boheme' is a one-of-a-kind journey to a raw yet romantic place, to a sphere where people hunger for both artistic ideals and morsels of food.",

    "description": "In <i>Searching for God Knows What</i>, Donald Miller's provocative and funny book, he shows readers that the greatest desire of \"every\" person is the desire for redemption. Every person is constantly seeking redemption (or at least the feeling of it) in his or her life, believing countless gospels that promise to fix the brokenness. Typically their pursuits include the desire for fulfilling relationships, successful careers, satisfying religious systems, status, and escape. Miller reveals how the inability to find redemption leads to chaotic relationships, self-hatred, the accumulation of meaningless material possessions, and a lack of inner peace. Readers will learn to identify in themselves and within others the universal desire for redemption. They will discover that the gospel of Jesus is the only way to find meaning in life and true redemption. Mature believers as well as seekers and new Christians will find themselves identifying with the narrative journey unfolded in the book, which is simply the pursuit of redemption.<br /><br />In <i>Searching for God Knows What</i>, best-selling author Donald Miller invites you to reconnect with a faith worth believing. With humor, intelligence, and his trademark writing style, he shows that relationship is God\u2019s way of leading us to redemption. And our need for redemption drives us to relationship with God. \u201cBeing a Christian,\u201d Miller writes, \u201cis more like falling in love than understanding a series of ideas.\u201d<br /><br />Maybe you are a Christian wondering what faith you signed up for. Or maybe you don\u2019t believe anything and are daring someone\u2014anyone\u2014to show you a genuine example of authentic faith. Somewhere beyond the self-help formulas, fancy marketing, and easy promises there is a life-changing experience with God waiting. Searching for God Knows What weaves together beautiful stories and fresh perspectives on the Bible to show one man\u2019s journey to find it.",

He wants to dream about Cho Chang, his crush (and maybe do more than dream). He wants to find out about the mysterious event that's supposed to take place at the Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't happened in a hundred years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen year old wizard. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not normal - even by wizarding standards.<br /><br />And in his case, different can be deadly.<br />--jacket flap",

    "description": "One man's tour of Ireland on tap; a rollicking travelogue in the tradition of <i>Round Ireland with a Fridge</i> and <i>McCarthy's Bar.</i><br />\u00a0<br />\"Regret\" is the word that best describes Evan McHugh's first taste of Guinness. For an Australian raised on Vegemite, Ireland's black brew is very much an acquired taste. But the travel-writer is committed to acquiring it. Determined to discover exactly what makes a pint of Guinness so legendary, he crosses the Emerald Isle in search of his answers.<br />But in sampling pints as he goes, McHugh soon realizes that in each town, and at every pub, someone always says that the best glass of Guinness is to be found . . . . somewhere else. <br />In his comedic and sentimental journey, McHugh and his companion, Twidkiwodm (the-woman-he-didn't-know-he-would-one-day-marry), hitch around Ireland, meeting unforgettable characters. He goes rowing with a German bagpiper on the lakes of Killarney, windsurfing with a one-armed man in Dingle, survives an encounter with poteen and even finds his own bar . . . but keeps searching for the perfect pint.<br />As entertaining as it is informative, <i>Pint-Sized Ireland</i> is both a hilarious travelogue and thoughtful diary. McHugh's comedic voice swiftly moves in and out of pubs, peering into froth-rimmed pints, and leading readers to question: So does he ever find the perfect pot of black gold?\u00a0 <br />Those who have rested upon the barstools of Ireland, who have sought the famed \"perfect pint of Guinness,\" realize that perfection rests in more than just the taste. McHugh captures the visceral experience of Guinness and Ireland in a warm memoir that's perfect to savor.<br />\u00a0<br />International Praise for <i>Pint-Sized </i><i>Ireland</i><br />\u00a0<br />\"McHugh's idea of traveling is one continuous pub crawl . . . an entertaining homage to the black brew.\"<br />---<i>The Age</i> (Australia)<br />\u00a0<br />\"McHugh's writing style is intelligent, quirky, and conversational. The result is a consummately easy to read book, amusing and engaging. It'll make you want to go in search of your own perfect pint.\"<br />---<i>Adventure Travel</i><br />\u00a0<br />\"This is a lovely book, well written, full of humorous anecdotes and works both as a travelogue and as a guide to drinking in Ireland. One of the real joys of this book is the way that the author captures the nuances and syntax of the way the people speak ('\"Rooit\", said the pub-landlord, 'in ye coom\"'). After a few pages you find yourself falling into this yourself and by the time you finish the book you will have developed a full-blown Irish accent.\"---<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bootsnall.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bootsnall.com</a>",

    "description": "The poems of Charles Baudelaire are filled with explicit and unsettling imagery, depicting with intensity every day subjects ignored by French literary conventions of his time. 'Tableaux parisiens' portrays the brutal life of Paris's thieves, drunkards and prostitutes amid the debris of factories and poorhouses. In love poems such as 'Le Beau Navire', flights of lyricism entwine with languorous eroticism, while prose poems such as 'La Chambre Double' deal with the agonies of artistic creation and mortality. With their startling combination of harsh reality and sublime beauty, formal ingenuity and revolutionary poetic language, these poems, including a generous selection from Les Fleurs du Mal, show Baudelaire as one of the most influential poets of the nineteenth century.",

It's a guide to the open road that's strictly AAAthat's attitude, adventure, and ass-kicking good times. Filled with indispensable information such as how to get out of a speeding ticket without crying and 14 ways to open a beer bottle on your car, The Bad Girl's Guide to the Open Road also gives the practical lowdown on what to do when your engine overheats, you get a flat, or you need a safe and legal place to spend the night in your car. The fabulous pocket format and indestructible cover make it perfect for flinging in the glove compartment (or stashing in your cubicle if you can't leave right away). For every woman who's about to break unless she gets a break, this hilarious book is the antidote to the doldrumswhether work-, man-, or self-induced. The Bad Girl's Guide to the Open Road: because sometimes a girl's just gotta go.",

    "description": "Katherine Neville's debut novel is a postmodern thriller set in 1972 ... and 1790. In the 20th century, Catherine Velis is a computer expert with a flair for music, painting, and chess who, on her way to Algeria at the behest of the accounting firm where she is employed, is invited to take a mysterious moonlighting assignment: recover the pieces of an old chess set missing for centuries.<br /><br />In the midst of the French Revolution, a young novice discovers that her abbey is the hiding place of a chess set, once owned by the great Charlemagne, which allows those who play it to tap into incredible powers beyond the imagination. She eventually comes into contact with the major historical figures of the day, from Robespierre to Napoleon, each of whom has an agenda.<br /><br /><i>The Eight</i> is a non-stop ride that recalls the swashbuckling adventures of Indiana Jones as well as the historical puzzles of Umberto Eco which, since its first publication in 1988, has gone on to acquire a substantial cult following.",

Taken away from his parents, he was brought up in Lhasa according to a monastic regimen of rigorous austerity and in almost total isolation. Aged seven, he was enthroned in the 1000-room Potala palace as the supreme spiritual leader of a nation the size of Western Europe, with a population of six million. At fifteen, he became head of state.",

    "description": "A contemporary noir,<em> Already Dead </em>is the tangled story of Nelson Fairchild Jr., disenfranchised scion to a northern California land fortune. A relentless failure, Nelson has botched nearly every scheme he's attempted to pull off. Now his future lies in a potentially profitable marijuana patch hidden in the lush old-growth redwoods on the family land.<br /><br />Nelson has some serious problems. His marriage has fallen apart, and he may lose his land, cash and crop in the divorce. What's more, in need of some quick cash, he had foolishly agreed to smuggle $90,000 worth of cocaine through customs for Harry Lally, a major player in a drug syndicate. Chickening out just before bringing the drugs through, he flushed the powder. Now Lally wants him dead, and two goons are hot on his trail. Desperate, terrified and alone, for Nelson, there may be only one way out.<br /><br />This is Denis Johnson's biggest and most complex book to date, and it perfectly showcases his signature themes of fate, redemption and the unraveling of the fabric of today's society. <em>Already Dead,</em> with its masterful narrative of overlapping and entwined stories, will further fuel the acclaim that surrounds one of today's most fascinating writers.",

    "description": "O\u2019Hara did for fictional Gibbsville, Pennsylvania what Faulkner did for Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi: surveyed its social life and drew its psychic outlines, but he did it in utterly worldly terms, without Faulkner\u2019s taste for mythic inference or the basso profundo of his prose. Julian English is a man who squanders what fate gave him. He lives on the right side of the tracks, with a country club membership, and a wife who loves him. His decline and fall, over the course of just 72 hours around Christmas, is a matter of too much spending, too much liquor, and a couple of reckless gestures. That his calamity is petty and preventable only makes it more powerful. In Faulkner, the tragedies all seem to be taking place on Olympus, even when they\u2019re happening among the low-lifes. In O\u2019Hara, they could be happening to you.",

As funny as it is sad, <i>Good as Gold</i> is a story of children grown up, parents grown old, and friends and lovers grown apart -- a story that is inimitably Heller.",

    "description": "The now-classic, utterly unique voice of Ann Beattie is so dry it throws off sparks, her eye endowed with the emotional equivalent of X-ray vision. Her characters are young men and women discovering what it means to be a grown-up in a country that promised them they'd stay young forever. And here, in shapely, penetrating stories, Beattie confirms why she is one of the most widely imitated -- yet surely inimitable -- literary stylists of her generation.<br /><br />In <b>The Burning House</b>, Beattie's characters go from dealing drugs to taking care of a bereaved friend. They watch their marriages fail not with a bang but with a wisecrack. And afterward, they may find themselves trading confidences with their spouses' new lovers. <b>The Burning House</b> proves that Beattie has no peer when it comes to revealing the hidden shapes of our relationships, or the depths of tenderness, grief, and anger that lie beneath the surfaces of our daily lives.",

These stories crackle with humor, intelligence and style and add up to an outrageously funny, unforgettable debut.",

    "description": "Michael Baigent, Henry Lincoln, and Richard Leigh, authors of <i>The Messianic Legacy</i>, spent over 10 years on their own kind of quest for the Holy Grail, into the secretive history of early France. What they found, researched with the tenacity and attention to detail that befits any great quest, is a tangled and intricate story of politics and faith that reads like a mystery novel. It is the story of the Knights Templar, and a behind-the-scenes society called the Prieure de Sion, and its involvement in reinstating descendants of the Merovingian bloodline into political power. Why? The authors of <i>Holy Blood, Holy Grail: The Secret History of Jesus, the Shocking Legacy of the Grail</i> assert that their explorations into early history ultimately reveal that Jesus may not have died on the cross, but lived to marry and father children whose bloodline continues today. The authors' point here is not to compromise or to demean Jesus, but to offer another, more complete perspective of Jesus as God's incarnation in man. The power of this secret, which has been carefully guarded for hundreds of years, has sparked much controversy. For all the sensationalism and hoopla surrounding <i>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</i> and the alternate history that it outlines, the authors are careful to keep their perspective and sense of skepticism alive in its pages, explaining carefully and clearly how they came to draw such combustible conclusions. <i>--Jodie Buller</i>",

As death approaches, existence takes on, for some of Updike\u2019s aging characters, a translucence, a magical fragility; vivid memory and casual misperception lend the mundane an antic texture, and the backward view, lengthening, acquires a certain grandeur. Here is a world where wonder stubbornly persists, and fresh beginnings almost outnumber losses.",

There follows tales of life away from home, student days, early marriage and young families, and finally Updike's experimental stories on 'The Single Life'. Here, then, is a rich and satisfying feast of Updike - his wit, his easy mastery of language, his genius for recalling the subtleties of ordinary life and the excitements, and perils, of the pursuit of happiness.",

Zuckerman, whose work was his life, is unable to write a line. Now, his work is trekking from one doctor to another, but none can find a cause for the pain and nobody can assuage it. Zuckerman himself wonders if the pain can have been caused by his own books. And while he is wondering, his dependence on painkillers grows into an addiction to vodka, marijuana, and Percodan.",

The speaker is David Kepesh, white-haired and over sixty, an eminent TV culture critic and star lecturer at a New York college - as well as an articulate propagandist of the sexual revolution. For years he has made a practice of sleeping with adventurous female students while maintaining an aesthete's critical distance. But now that distance has been annihilated.<br />The agency of Kepesh's undoing is Consuela Castillo, the decorous, humblingly beautiful twenty-four-year-old daughter of Cuban exiles. When he becomes involved with her, Kepesh finds himself dragged helplessly into the quagmire of sexual jealousy and loss. In chronicling the themes of eros and mortality, licence and repression, freedom and sacrifice. <i>The Dying Animal</i> is a burning coal of a book, filled with intellectual heat and not a little danger.",

    "description": "<i>Letting Go</i> is Roth's first full-length novel, published just after <i>Goodbye, Columbus</i>, when he was twenty-nine. Set in 1950s Chicago, New York, and Iowa city, <i>Letting Go</i> presents as brilliant a fictional portrait as we have of a mid-century America defined by social and ethical constraints and by moral compulsions conspicuously different from those of today.<br /><br />Newly discharged from the Korean War army, reeling from his mother's recent death, freed from old attachments and hungrily seeking others, Gabe Wallach is drawn to Paul Herz, a fellow graduate student in literature, and to Libby, Paul's moody, intense wife. Gabe's desire to be connected to the ordered \"world of feeling\" that he finds in books is first tested vicariously by the anarchy of the Herzes' struggles with responsible adulthood and then by his own eager love affairs. Driven by the desire to live seriously and act generously, Gabe meets an impassable test in the person of Martha Reganhart, a spirited, outspoken, divorced mother of two, a formidable woman who, according to critic James Atlas, is masterfully portrayed with \"depth and resonance.\"<br /><br />The complex liason between Gabe and Martha and Gabe's moral enthusiasm for the trials of others are at the heart of this tragically comic work.",

    "description": "<p>A remarkable compendium of the worst military decisions and the men who made them. </p> <p>The annals of history are littered with horribly bad military leaders. These combat incompetents found amazing ways to ensure their army's defeat. Whether it was a lack of proper planning, miscalculation, ego, bad luck, or just plain stupidity, certain wartime stratagems should never have left the drawing board. Written with wit, intelligence, and eminent readability, <i>How to Lose a Battle</i> pays dubious homage to these momentous and bloody blunders, including:</p>   <b>Cannae, 216 B.C.;</b> the bumbling Romans lose 80,000 troops to Hannibal's forces.   <b>The Second Crusade;</b> an entire Christian army is slaughtered when it stops for a drink of water.   <b>The Battle of Britain;</b> Hitler's dreaded Luftwaffe blows it big-time.   <b>Pearl Harbor;</b> more than one warning of the impending attack is there, but nobody listens.   <p> <i>How to Lose a Battle</i> includes more than thirty-five chapters worth of astonishing (and avoidable) disasters, both infamous and obscure; a treasure trove of trivia, history, and jaw-dropping facts about the most costly military missteps ever taken.</p>",

When he finds, after his father's death, a packet of wartime letters to a former fiancee and learns of David's court-martial, Stewart is driven to uncover the truth about the enigmatic distant man he never knew. Using military archives, old letters, and David's own notes, he discovers that David, a JAG lawyer, had pursued a maverick U.S. officer in Europe, fallen in love with a beautiful resistance fighter, and fought in the war's deadliest conflicts. In reconstructing the terrible events and agonizing choices his father faced on the battlefield, in the courtrfoom, and in love, Stewart gains a closer understanding of his father's secret past and of the brutal nature of war itself.",

    "description": "Rohinton Mistry\u2019s enthralling novel is at once a domestic drama and an intently observed portrait of present-day Bombay in all its vitality and corruption. At the age of seventy-nine, Nariman Vakeel, already suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease, breaks an ankle and finds himself wholly dependent on his family. His step-children, Coomy and Jal, have a spacious apartment (in the inaptly named Chateau Felicity), but are too squeamish and resentful to tend to his physical needs.<br /><br />Nariman must now turn to his younger daughter, Roxana, her husband, Yezad, and their two sons, who share a small, crowded home. Their decision will test not only their material resources but, in surprising ways, all their tolerance, compassion, integrity, and faith. Sweeping and intimate, tragic and mirthful, <i>Family Matters</i> is a work of enormous emotional power.",

    "description": "In this honest and stunning novel, James Baldwin has given America a moving story of love in the face of injustice. Told through the eyes of Tish, a nineteen-year-old girl, in love with Fonny, a young sculptor who is the father of her child, Baldwin's story mixes the sweet and the sad. Tish and Fonny have pledged to get married, but Fonny is falsely accused of a terrible crime and imprisoned. Their families set out to clear his name, and as they face an uncertain future, the young lovers experience a kaleidoscope of emotions-affection, despair, and hope. In a love story that evokes the blues, where passion and sadness are inevitably intertwined, Baldwin has created two characters so alive and profoundly realized that they are unforgettably ingrained in the American psyche.",

Over six years in the writing, and brilliantly and beautifully packaged, this novella is Saunders' first stand-alone, book-length work\u2014and his first book for adults in five years.<br /><br />",

Here are Rhett Butler, Scarlett's counterpart, a professional scoundrel as courageous as Scarlett herself; Melanie Wilkes, a loyal friend and true gentlewoman; and Ashley Wilkes, for whom the world ended at Appomattox. Here area ll the characters and memorable episodes that make Gone with the Wind a book to read and re-read and remember forever.<br /><br />(front flap)",

    "description": "In his Illuminated Books, William Blake combined text and imagery on a single page in a way that had not been done since the Middle Ages. For Blake, religion and politics, intellect and emotion, mind and body were both unified and in conflict with each other: his work is expressive of his personal mythology, and his methods of conveying it were integral to its meaning. There is no comparison with reading books such as Jerusalem, America, and Songs of Innocence and of Experience in Blake's own medium, infused with his sublime and exhilarating colors. Tiny figures and forms dance among the lines of the text, flames appear to burn up the page, and dense passages of Biblical-sounding text are brought to a jarring halt by startling images of death, destruction, and liberation. Blake's hope that his books would obtain wide circulation was unfulfilled: some exist only in unique copies and none was printed in more than very small numbers. Now, for the first time, the plates from the William Blake Trust's Collected Edition have been brought together in a single volume, with transcripts of the texts and an introduction by the noted scholar David Bindman. Includes: Jerusalem; Songs of Innocence and of Experience; All Religions are One; There is No Natural Religion; The Book of Thel; The Marriage of Heaven and Hell; Visions of the Daughters of Albion; America a Prophecy; Europe a Prophecy; The Song of Los Milton a Poem; The Ghost of Abel; On Homers Poetry and] On Virgil; Laocoon; The First Book of Urizen; The Book of Ahania; The Book of Los.",

    "description": "<br /><br /><b>Having done the longest day in literature with his monumental <b>Ulysses</b>, James Joyce set himself even greater challenges for his next book \u2014 the night.</b>\"A nocturnal state...That is what I want to convey: what goes on in a dream, during a dream.\" The work, which would exhaust two decades of his life and the odd resources of some sixty languages, culminated in the 1939 publication of Joyce's final and most revolutionary masterpiece, <b>\n  <i>Finnegans Wake</i>\n</b>.<br /><br />A story with no real beginning or end (it ends in the middle of a sentence and begins in the middle of the same sentence), this \"book of Doublends Jined\" is as remarkable for its prose as for its circular structure. Written in a fantantic dream language, forged from polyglot puns and portmanteau words, the <b>\n  <i>Wake</i>\n</b> features some of Joyce's most brilliant inventive work. Sixty years after its original publication, it remains, in Anthony Burgess's words, \"a great comic vision, one of the few books of the world that can make us laugh aloud on nearly every page.\"<br />",

    "description": "When good-time, fortysomething Molly Lane dies of an unspecified degenerative illness, her many friends and numerous lovers are led to think about their own mortality. Vernon Halliday, editor of the upmarket newspaper the <i>Judge</i>, persuades his old friend Clive Linley, a self-indulgent composer of some reputation, to enter into a euthanasia pact with him. Should either of them be stricken with such an illness, the other will bring about his death. From this point onward we are in little doubt as to <i>Amsterdam</i>'s outcome--it's only a matter of who will kill whom. In the meantime, compromising photographs of Molly's most distinguished lover, foreign secretary Julian Garmony, have found their way into the hands of the press, and as rumors circulate he teeters on the edge of disgrace. However, this is McEwan, so it is no surprise to find that the rather unsavory Garmony comes out on top. Ian McEwan is master of the writer's craft, and while this is the sort of novel that wins prizes, his characters remain curiously soulless amidst the twists and turns of plot. <i>--Lisa Jardine</i>",

Stories from the Old and New Testament are brought together in the pages of this stunning book, showcased within an attractive presentation box.<br /><br /><i>The Children's Illustrated Bible</i> chronicles the life and times of Jesus in detail, using decorative illustrations to help younger readers understand the beliefs and stories at the heart of Christianity. From the peak of Mount Sinai to the shores of the Sea of Galilee, the lands and locations in the Bible are shown clearly on maps, while supporting photographs give children a modern context for this historic book. Traditional religious works are rarely suitable for younger readers, but <i>The Children's Illustrated Bible </i>features the most accessible illustrations and text to be enjoyed by everyone.<br /><br />This is the perfect gift for Easter, Christmas, or Bible study, but can just as easily be shared by children, parents, and families as a series of stories.",

    "description": "Winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year. 'Outstanding...a stunningly good read' Observer. 'Mark Haddon's portrayal of an emotionally dissociated mind is a superb achievement...Wise and bleakly funny' Ian McEwan. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a murder mystery novel like no other. The detective, and narrator, is Christopher Boone. Christopher is fifteen and has Asperger's Syndrome. He knows a very great deal about maths and very little about human beings. He loves lists, patterns and the truth. He hates the colours yellow and brown and being touched. He has never gone further than the end of the road on his own, but when he finds a neighbour's dog murdered he sets out on a terrifying journey which will turn his whole world upside down.",

    "description": "\"Of all the people I play against, the only one I truly fear is Larry Bird.\"--Magic Johnson, from the Foreword.The heart and soul of a champion: his life, his career, his game. To understand basketball, you have to understand Larry Bird. Arguably the greatest all-around player the game has ever known, he led the Boston Celtics from the basement to three world championships, collecting three NBA Most Valuable Player awards along the way. Yet, despite these massive accomplishments, Bird has rarely talked to the press, and much about the man has remained a mystery. Now in \"Drive,\" the long-silent superstar sets the record straight, revealed a side of himself-and of basketball-you've never see before. Inside, you'll learn Bird's most private feelings about: The momentous decision to transfer from Bobby Knight's Indiana University to Indiana State. The heartbreak of his father's suicide and his own failed marriage. The single-minded discipline that tumed a small-town hero into a national superstar. The Boston Garden and the legendary Celtic charm. The Isiah Thomas controversy and the fierce Celtic-Laker rivalry. The great players of the NBA: including Magic Johnson, Dominique Wilkins, and Michael Jordan, and much more. here is the book that puts a basketball legend-and his game-on the line. And scores!",

    "description": "Eliza Naumann, a seemingly unremarkable nine-year-old, expects never to fit into her gifted family: her autodidact father, Saul, absorbed in his study of Jewish mysticism; her brother, Aaron, the vessel of his father's spiritual ambitions; and her brilliant but distant lawyer-mom, Miriam. But when Eliza sweeps her school and district spelling bees in quick succession, Saul takes it as a sign that she is destined for greatness. In this altered reality, Saul inducts her into his hallowed study and lavishes upon her the attention previously reserved for Aaron, who in his displacement embarks upon a lone quest for spiritual fulfillment. When Miriam's secret life triggers a familial explosion, it is Eliza who must order the chaos.<br /><br />Myla Goldberg's keen eye for detail brings Eliza's journey to three-dimensional life. As she rises from classroom obscurity to the blinding lights and outsized expectations of the National Bee, Eliza's small pains and large joys are finely wrought and deeply felt.<br /><br />Not merely a coming-of-age story, Goldberg's first novel delicately examines the unraveling fabric of one family. The outcome of this tale is as startling and unconventional as her prose, which wields its metaphors sharply and rings with maturity. The work of a lyrical and gifted storyteller, <i>Bee Season</i> marks the arrival of an extraordinarily talented new writer.",

    "description": "In the fifth Vampire Chronicle, Lestat is searching for Dora, the beautiful and charismatic mortal daughter of a drug lord. Dora has moved Lestat like no other mortal ever has, and he cannot get her out of his visions. At the same time, he is increasingly aware that the Devil knows who he is and wants something from him.

Mama and Papa Bear are stunned when they receive a letter from Brother Bear's teacher. Even though Brother Bear sits down diligently every night with an open notebook, he has <i>not</i> been completing his homework assignments. After taking a closer look, Mama and Papa realize that there's a whole lot of competition going on for Brother's attention. He's watching TV, listening to his boom box, talking on the cell phone, and playing a video game. Join in the fun and learning as the subject of multimedia distraction is tackled with wit, wisdom, and aplomb.",

    "description": "Slapped with a libel suit after an appearance on a talk show, Malachy McCourt crows, \"If they could only see me now in the slums of Limerick, a big shot, sued for a million. Bejesus, isn't America a great and wonderful country?\" His older brother Frank's Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir, <em>Angela's Ashes</em>, took its somber tone from the bleak atmosphere of those slums, while Malachy's boisterous recollections are fueled by his zestful appreciation for the opportunities and oddities of his native land. He and Frank were born in Brooklyn, moved with their parents to Ireland as children, then returned to the States as adults. This book covers the decade 1952-63, when Malachy roistered across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, but spent most of his time in New York City. There his ready wit and quick tongue won him an acting job with the Irish Players, a semiregular stint on <em>The Tonight Show</em> hosted by Jack Paar, and friendships with some well-heeled, well-born types who shared his fondness for saloon life and bankrolled him in an East Side saloon that may have been the first singles bar. He chronicles those events--and many others--with back-slapping bonhomie. Although McCourt acknowledges the personal demons that pursued him from his poverty-stricken childhood and destroyed his first marriage, this is on the whole an exuberant autobiography that pays tribute to the joys of a freewheeling life.",

    "description": "When <i>Desert Solitaire</i> was first published in 1968, it became the focus of a nationwide cult. Rude and sensitive. Thought-provoking and mystical. Angry and loving. Both Abbey and this book are all of these and more. Here, the legendary author of <i>The Monkey Wrench Gang</i>, <i>Abbey's Road</i> and many other critically acclaimed books vividly captures the essence of his life during three seasons as a park ranger in southeastern Utah. This is a rare view of a quest to experience nature in its purest form--the silence, the struggle, the overwhelming beauty. But this is also the gripping, anguished cry of a man of character who challenges the growing exploitation of the wilderness by oil and mining interests, as well as by the tourist industry.<br /><br />Abbey's observations and challenges remain as relevant now as the day he wrote them. Today, <i>Desert Solitaire</i> asks if any of our incalculable natural treasures can be saved before the bulldozers strike again.",

    "description": "Imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion. This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.<br /><br />\"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\" <br /><br />So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy-- exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling-- does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. <br /><br />Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors--yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness. <br /><br />Angela's Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.",

    "description": "Ed Abbey called <i>The Monkey Wrench Gang</i>, his 1975 novel, a \"comic extravaganza.\" Some readers have remarked that the book is more a comic book than a real novel, and it's true that reading this incendiary call to protect the American wilderness requires more than a little of the old willing suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />The story centers on Vietnam veteran George Washington Hayduke III, who returns to the desert to find his beloved canyons and rivers threatened by industrial development. On a rafting trip down the Colorado River, Hayduke joins forces with feminist saboteur Bonnie Abbzug, wilderness guide Seldom Seen Smith, and billboard torcher Doc Sarvis, M.D., and together they wander off to wage war on the big yellow machines, on dam builders and road builders and strip miners. As they do, his characters voice Abbey's concerns about wilderness preservation (\"Hell of a place to lose a cow,\" Smith thinks to himself while roaming through the canyonlands of southern Utah. \"Hell of a place to lose your heart. Hell of a place... to lose. Period\").<br /><br />Moving from one improbable situation to the next, packing more adventure into the space of a few weeks than most real people do in a lifetime, the motley gang puts fear into the hearts of their enemies, laughing all the while. It's comic, yes, and required reading for anyone who has come to love the desert.",

Drawing on those who surrounded her -- Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Arthur Koestler -- and her passionate love affair with Nelson Algren, Beauvoir dissects the emotional and philosophical currents of her time. At once an engrossing drama and an intriguing political tale, <i>The Mandarins</i> is the emotional odyssey of a woman torn between her inner desire and her public life.<br /><br /><i>The Mandarins</i> won France's highest literary prize, the Prix Goncourt.",

In other words, to be touched by God is to be restored. To become all God meant you to be. That is what Christianity is supposed to do for you\u2014make you whole, set you free, bring you fully alive.<br /><br />But Jesus also warned that the path to that life is narrow, and few people would find it. You\u2019ll notice few have. Waking the Dead will help you find that life, see the fierce battle over your heart, and embrace all that God has for you.<br /><br />There is so much more. Do you want it?<br /><br />Praise for Waking the Dead:<br /><br />\u201cJohn\u2019s words have empowered and encouraged me. I am so grateful that my heart is awake and alive, and I, even as a tender, deeply feminine woman, am fierce and capable of great things . . . of being a vital part of the advancement of the kingdom. And that alone is what my heart is after.\u201d \u2014Jenny from Columbia, SC<br /><br />\u201cI have been half-alive for too long now . . . I\u2019m awake and alive again; clarity is what I needed. I feel like I just got drenched with cool water on a very hot day.\u201d \u2014Chris from Colorado Springs, CO<br /><br />\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to want a deeper connection with God\u2014it\u2019s a whole different level to realize that my heart is the treasure of God . . . This is a book of incredible wealth.\u201d \u2014Tim from San Luis Obispo, CA",

    "description": "The year is 1989 and Mark Doty's life has reached a state of enviable equilibrium. His reputation as a poet of formidable talent is growing, he enjoys his work as a college professor and, perhaps most importantly, he is deeply in love with his partner of many years, Wally Roberts. The harmonious existence these two men share is shattered, however, when they learn that Wally has tested positive for the HIV virus. From diagnosis to the initial signs of deterioration to the heartbreaking hour when Wally is released from his body's ruined vessel, <em>Heaven's Coast</em>is an intimate chronicle of love, its hardships, and its innumerable gifts. We witness Doty's passage through the deepest phase of grief -- letting his lover go while keeping him firmly alive in memory and heart -- and, eventually beyond, to the slow reawakening of the possibilities of pleasure. Part memoir, part journal, part elegy for a life of rare communication and beauty, <em>Heaven's Coast</em> evinces the same stunning honesty, resplendent descriptive power and rapt attention to the physical landscape that has won Doty's poetry such attention and acclaim.",

The day-to-day story of the trip is told here in the Log, which combines science, philosophy and high-spirited adventure.",

Nominated for the Edgar Award for best true-crime book of the year, it also marked the debut of an audaciously talented writer, James St. James, who himself had been a club kid and close friend and confidant of Michael Alig, the young man convicted of killing the drug dealer known as Angel. </p><p> Now the book has been brought to the screen as <i>Party Monster,</i> with Macaulay Culkin playing killer Michael Alig and Seth Green as author/celebutante James St. James.</p>",

    "description": "This is the book that shaped the landscape of contemporary science fiction and fantasy. When <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> first appeared, the critics inevitably compared it to this 1922 landmark work. Tolkien himself frankly acknowledged its influence, with warm praise for its imaginative appeal. The story of a remote planet\u2019s great war between two kingdoms, it ranks as the <i>Iliad</i> of heroic fantasy.<br /><br />In the best traditions of Homeric epics, Norse sagas, and Arthurian myths, author E. R. Eddison weaves a compelling adventure, with a majestic, Shakespearean narrative style. His sweeping tale recounts battles between warriors and witches on fog-shrouded mountaintops and in the ocean\u2019s depths\u2014along with romantic interludes, backroom intrigues, and episodes of direst treachery. Generations of readers have joyfully lost themselves in the timeless worlds of <i>The Worm Ouroboros</i>.<br /><br />[This new edition is illustrated with the classic original images.]<br />",

Illustrated with graphic designer Paul Rand's colorful, witty artwork, <i>Sparkle and Spin</i> is a children's classic (now happily available again through Chronicle Books) that reveals to young readers the power and music in the words they use every day.<i>\"Paul Rand did not set out to create classic children's books, he simply wanted to make pictures that were playful. Like the alchemist of old, he transformed unlikely abstract forms into icons that inspired children and adultsand laid the foundation for two books that have indeed become children's classics.\"</i><br />Steven Heller, author of <i>Paul Rand</i>",

In the 24th century, the Company preserves works of art and extinct forms of life (for profit of course). It recruits orphans from the past, renders them all but immortal, and trains them to serve the Company, Dr. Zeus. One of these is Mendoza the botanist. She is sent to Elizabethan England to collect samples from the garden of Sir Walter Iden. <br />But while there, she meets Nicholas Harpole, with whom she falls in love. And that love sounds great bells of change that will echo down the centuries, and through the succeeding novels of The Company.",

An initial book of this series is entitled \u2018The Graveyard Game\u2019. It was published by Tor Books in 2005. At the start of the book, Mendoza is introduced as a Preserver. She works for the Dr Zeus Company and lives in the past for collecting species for future. In an incident, Mendoza kills 6 people from California in the year 1863. As a result, the Company does not take her back into the present world, which results in her disappearance. One of the senior Preservers in the Company, named Joseph, loved Mendoza like his own daughter as he did not have any. When he hears about Mendoza\u2019s disappearance, he gets filled with rage. Joseph gets heavily drunk with chocolate and decides to find her, no matter how long it takes for him to get to her. As Joseph was an immortal and indestructible cyborg, he had unlimited patience in him. The mission that he starts for rescuing Mendoza, soon goes on to uncover a deep conspiracy that stretches over more than 50 centuries. Behind the conspiracy lie genocide and graveyards full of agents of the Company. Joseph also comes across an ominous Silence that spread all over in 2355. Joseph becomes successful in finding Mendoza. She too, joins him in unraveling the conspiracy by getting deep into its roots.",

    "description": "This story of two men locked in a war of wills that threatens their very existence is vintage Irvine Welsh. <br />Troubled restaurant inspector Danny Skinner is on a quest to find the mysterious father his mother will not identify. Unraveling this hidden information is the key to understanding the crippling compulsions that threaten to wreck his young life. His ensuing journey takes him from the festival city of Edinburgh to the foodie city of San Francisco. But the hard-drinking, womanizing Skinner has a strange nemesis in the form of mild-mannered fellow inspector Brian Kibby. It is Skinner's unfathomable, obsessive hatred of Kibby that takes over everything, threatening to destroy not only Skinner and his mission but also those he loves most dearly. When Kibby contracts a horrific, undiagnosable illness, Skinner understands that his destiny is inextricably bound to that of his hated rival, and he is faced with a terrible dilemma. Irvine Welsh's work is a transgressive parable about the great obsessions of our time: food, sex, and celebrity.",

    "description": "Long hailed as a seminal work of modernism in the tradition of Joyce and Kafka, and now available in a supple new English translation, Italo Svevo\u2019s charming and splendidly idiosyncratic novel conducts readers deep into one hilariously hyperactive and endlessly self-deluding mind. The mind in question belongs to one Zeno Cosini, a neurotic Italian businessman who is writing his confessions at the behest of his psychiatrist. Here are Zeno\u2019s interminable attempts to quit smoking, his courtship of the beautiful yet unresponsive Ada, his unexpected\u2013and unexpectedly happy\u2013marriage to Ada\u2019s homely sister Augusta, and his affair with a shrill-voiced aspiring singer. Relating these misadventures with wry wit and irony, and a perspicacity at once unblinking and compassionate, <b>Zeno\u2019s Conscience</b><i> </i>is a miracle of psychological realism.",

    "description": "The words Abraham Lincoln spoke at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery at Gettysburg comprise perhaps the most famous speech in history. It has been quoted by popes, presidents, prime ministers, and revolutionaries around the world. From \"Four score and seven years ago...\" to \"government of the people, by the people, for the people,\" Lincoln's words echo in the American conscience. Many books have been written about the Gettysburg Address and yet, as Lincoln scholar Gabor Boritt shows, there is much that we don't know about the speech. In \"The Gettysburg Gospel\" he reconstructs what really happened in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on November 19, 1863. Boritt tears away a century of myths, lies, and legends to give us a clear understanding of the greatest American's greatest speech.In the aftermath of the bloodiest battle ever fought in North America, the little town of Gettysburg was engulfed in the worst man-made disaster in U.S. history: close to 21,000 wounded; very few doctors; heroic women coping in houses, barns, and churches turned into hospitals; dead horses and mules rotting in farmyards and fields; and at least 7,000 dead soldiers who had to be dug up, identified, and reburied. This was where Lincoln had to come to explain why the horror of war must continue.<br /><br />Planning America's first national cemetery revitalized the traumatized people of Gettysburg, but the dedication ceremonies overwhelmed the town. Lincoln was not certain until the last moment whether he could come. But he knew the significance of the occasion and wrote his remarks with care -- the first speech since his inauguration that he prepared before delivering it. A careful analysis of the Addressand the public reaction to it form the center of this book. Boritt shows how Lincoln responded to the politics of the time and also clarifies which text he spoke from and how and when he wrote the various versions. Few people initially recognized the importance of the speech; it was frequently and, at times, hilariously misreported. But over the years the speech would grow into American scripture. It would acquire new and broader meanings. It would be better understood, but also misunderstood and misinterpreted to suit beliefs very different from Lincoln's.<br /><br />\"The Gettysburg Gospel\" is based on years of scholarship as well as a deep understanding of Lincoln and of Gettysburg itself. It draws on vital documents essential to appreciating Lincoln's great speech and its evolution into American gospel. This is an indispensable book for anyone interested in the Gettysburg Address, Abraham Lincoln, the Civil War, or American history.",

    "description": "Aging Larry Cook announces his intention to turn over his 1,000-acre farm--one of the largest in Zebulon County, Iowa--to his three daughters, Caroline, Ginny, and Rose. A man of harsh sensibilities, he carves Caroline out of the deal because she has the nerve to be less than enthusiastic about her father's generosity. While Larry Cook deteriorates into a pathetic drunk, his daughters are left to cope with the often grim realities of life on a family farm--from battering husbands to cutthroat lenders. In this winner of the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, Smiley captures the essence of such a life with stark, painful detail.",

Semezdin Mehmedinovic remained a citizen of Sarajevo throughout the Serbian nationalists' siege and was active throughout the war in the city's resistance movement, as one of the editor's of the magazine Phantom of Liberty. <br /><br />Semezdin Mehmedinovic says that \"writing is, finally, quite a personal thing that doesn't make much sense unless you are practicing for the last word.\" For those Bosnians emerging from the siege or still in exile, these \"last words\" remain intimate possessions, one of the last bastions left against the commodification of tragedy.",

    "description": "This is the story of a man who said that he would stop the motor of the world\u2014and did. Was he a destroyer or the greatest of liberators? Why did he have to fight his battle, not against his enemies, but against those who needed him most, and his hardest battle against the woman he loved? What is the world\u2019s motor\u2014and the motive power of every man? You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the characters in this story.Tremendous in its scope, this novel presents an astounding panorama of human life\u2014from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboy\u2014to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destruction\u2014to the philosopher who becomes a pirate\u2014to the composer who gives up his career on the night of his triumph\u2014to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroad\u2014to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels.<br /><br />You must be prepared, when you read this novel, to check every premise at the root of your convictions. This is a mystery story, not about the murder\u2014and rebirth\u2014of man\u2019s spirit. It is a philosophical revolution, told in the form of an action thriller of violent events, a ruthlessly brilliant plot structure and an irresistible suspense. Do you say this is impossible? Well, <i>that</i> is the first of your premises to check.<br /><br />\u00a0<br /><br />\u00a0<br /><br />",

The attitudes reflect many of the characteristics of the <i>fin de si\u00e8cle</i>, yet Proust illumined them with the unique shafts of observation and gift of analysis that he was later to perfect in <i>The Remembrance of Things Past</i>. This book is a period piece of intricate delights and subtle flavors that will be relished by the author\u2019s many admirers.",

    "description": "From the exiled Kenyan novelist, playwright, poet, and literary critic--a magisterial comic novel that is certain to take its place as a landmark of postcolonial African literature.<br /><br />In exile now for more than twenty years, Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o has become one of the most widely read African writers of our time, the power and scope of his work garnering him international attention and praise. His aim in <i>Wizard of the Crow</i> is, in his own words,nothing less than \u201cto sum up Africa of the twentieth century in the context of two thousand years of world history.\u201d<br /><br />Commencing in \u201cour times\u201d and set in the \u201cFree Republic of Abur\u0129ria,\u201d the novel dramatizes with corrosive humor and keenness of observation a battle for control of the souls of the Abur\u0129rian people. Among the contenders: His High Mighty Excellency; the eponymous Wizard, an avatar of folklore and wisdom; the corrupt Christian Ministry; and the nefarious Global Bank. Fashioning the stories of the powerful and the ordinary into a dazzling mosaic, <i>Wizard of the Crow</i> reveals humanity in all its endlessly surprising complexity.<br /><br />Informed by richly enigmatic traditional African storytelling, <i>Wizard of the Crow</i> is a masterpiece, the crowning achievement in Ngugl wa Thiong\u2019o\u2019s career thus far.",

    "description": "Placing himself within the context of the Gospel of Matthew, Neusner imagines himself in a dialogue with Jesus of Nazareth and pays him the supreme Judaic gesture of respect: making a connection with him through an honest debate about the nature of God's One Truth. Neusner explains why the Sermon on the Mount would not have convinced him to follow Jesus and why, by the criterion of the Torah of Moses, he would have continued to follow the teachings of Moses. He explores the reasons Christians believe in Jesus Christ and the Kingdom of Heaven, while Jews continue to believe in the Torah of Moses and a kingdom of priests and holy people on earth. This revised and expanded edition, with a foreword by Donald Akenson, creates a thoughtful and accessible context for discussion of the most fundamental question of why Christians and Jews believe what they believe.",

Mosheen's dream of becoming a diplomat has been shattered and Zunaira can no longer even appear on the streets of Kabul unveiled. Atiq is a jailer who guards those who have been condemned to death; the darkness of prison and the wretchedness of his job have seeped into his soul. Atiq's wife, Musarrat, is suffering from an illness no doctor can cure. Yet, the lives of these four people are about to become inexplicably intertwined, through death and imprisonment to passion and extraordinary self-sacrifice.<br /><br /><i>The Swallows of Kabul </i>is an astounding and elegiac novel of four people struggling to hold on to their humanity in a place where pleasure is a deadly sin and death has become routine.",

    "description": "<i>Good Luck</i> is a whimsical fable that teaches a valuable lesson: good luck doesn't just come your way--it's up to you to create the conditions to bring yourself good luck. Written by Alex Rovira and Fernando Trias de Bes--two leading marketing consultants--this simple tale is universally applicable and uniquely inspirational. <i>Good Luck</i> tells the touching story of two old men, Max and Jim, who meet by chance in Central Park fifty years after they last saw each other as children. Max achieved great success in life; Jim sadly did not. The secret to Max's success lies in a story his grandfather told him long ago. This story within a story has a tone reminiscent of the classic <i>The Alchemist</i> and shows how to seize opportunity and achieve success in life. In a surprise ending, <i>Good Luck</i> comes full circle, offering the reader inspiration, instruction, and an engaging tale.",

    "description": "The provocative and mind-bending new novel from the bestselling author of <b>Fight Club</b> and <b>Haunted</b>.<br /><br /><b>Rant</b> takes the form of a (fictional) oral history of Buster \u201cRant\u201d Casey, in which an assortment of friends, enemies, admirers, detractors, and relations have their say on this evil character, who may or may not be the most efficient serial killer of our time.<br /><br />Buster Casey was every small kid born in a small town, searching for real thrills in a world of video games and action/adventure movies. The high school rebel who always wins \u2013 and a childhood murderer? \u2013 Rant Casey escapes from his hometown of Middleton into the big city and becomes the leader of an urban demolition derby called Party Crashing, where, on designated nights, the participants recognize each other by dressing their cars with tin-can tails, \u201cJust Married\u201d toothpaste graffiti, and other refuse, then look for special markings in order to stalk and crash into each other. It\u2019s in this violent, late-night hunting game that Casey makes three friends. And after his spectacular death, these friends gather the testimony needed to build an oral history of his short life. Their collected anecdotes explore the charges that his saliva infected hundreds and caused a silent, urban plague of rabies . . .<br /><br />Expect hilarity and horror, and blazing insight into the desperate and surreal contemporary human condition as only Chuck Palahniuk can deliver it. He\u2019s the postmillennial Jonathan Swift, the man to watch to learn what\u2019s \u2013 uh-oh \u2013 coming next.<br /><br /><b>Excerpt from <i>RANT</i></b>:<br /><b>\n  <br /><i>Wallace Boyer (Car Salesman)</i>\n</b><i>: Like most people, I didn\u2019t meet and talk to Rant Casey until after he was dead. That\u2019s how it works for most celebrities, after they croak their circle of close friends just explodes. A dead celebrity can\u2019t walk down the street without meeting a million best buddies they never met in real life.<br /><br />Dying was the best career move Jeff Dahmer and John Wayne Gacy ever made. . . . <br /><br />The way Rant Casey used to say it: Folks build a reputation by attacking you while you\u2019re alive\u2013or praising you after you ain\u2019t.</i>",

    "description": "The Algerian War lasted from 1954 to 1962. It brought down six French governments, led to the collapse of the Fourth Republic, returned de Gaulle to power, and came close to provoking a civil war on French soil. More than a million Muslim Algerians died in the conflict and as many European settlers were driven into exile. Above all, the war was marked by an unholy marriage of revolutionary terror and repressive torture.Nearly a half century has passed since this savagely fought war ended in Algerian independence, and yet ,as Alistair Horne argues in his new preface to his now-classic work of history,its repercussions continue to be felt not only in Algeria and France, but throughout the world. Indeed from today's vantage point the Algerian War looks like a full-dress rehearsal for the sort of amorphous struggle that convulsed the Balkans in the 1990s and that now ravages the Middle East, from Beirut to Baghdad struggles in which questions of religion, nationalism, imperialism, and terrorism take on a new and increasingly lethal intensity.<i>A Savage War of Peace</i> is the definitive history of the Algerian War, a book that brings that terrible and complicated struggle to life with intelligence, assurance, and unflagging momentum. It is essential reading for our own violent times as well as a lasting monument to the historian's art.",

    "description": "This unforgettable odyssey into the distant past carries us back to the awesome mysteries of the exotic, primeval world of <b>The Clan of the Cave Bear</b>, and to Ayla, now grown into a beautiful and courageous young woman.<br /><br />Cruelly cast out by the new leader of the ancient Clan that adopted her as a child, Ayla leaves those she loves behind and travels alone through a stark, open land filled with dangerous animals but few people, searching for the Others, tall and fair like herself. The short summer gives her little time to look, and when she finds a sheltered valley with a herd of hardy steppe horses, she decides to stay and prepare for the long glacial winter ahead. Living with the Clan has taught Ayla many skills but not real hunting. She finally knows she can survive when she traps a horse, which gives her meat and a warm pelt for the winter, but fate has bestowed a greater gift, an orphaned foal with whom she develops a unique kinship. One winter extends to more; she discovers a way to make fire more quickly and a wounded cave lion cub joins her unusual family, but her beloved animals don't fulfill her restless need for human companionship. Then she hears the sound of a man screaming in pain. She saves tall, handsome Jondalar, who brings her a language to speak and an awakening of love and desire, but Ayla is torn between her fear of leaving her valley and her hope of living with her own kind.",

The book that has it all is <i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i>, written in 1949 by Clive Staples Lewis. But Lewis did not stop there. Six more books followed, and together they became known as <i>The Chronicles of Narnia.</i><br /><br />For the past fifty years, <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i> have transcended the fantasy genre to become part of the canon of classic literature. Each of the seven books is a masterpiece, drawing the reader into a land where magic meets reality, and the result is a fictional world whose scope has fascinated generations.<br /><br />This edition presents all seven books\u2014unabridged\u2014in one impressive volume. The books are presented here in chronlogical order, each chapter graced with an illustration by the original artist, Pauline Baynes. Deceptively simple and direct, <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i> continue to captivate fans with adventures, characters, and truths that speak to readers of all ages, even fifty years after they were first published.",

    "description": "A meditation on the erotic life of women, an exploration of class prejudices, and most of all a portrayal of the thoughts and actions of an unforgettable young woman.<br /><br />A stunning new work from Anita Shreve, the author of the acclaimed bestsellers The Pilot's Wife and The Weight of Water, Fortune's Rocks is a profound and moving story about unwise love and the choices that transform a life. <br /><br />On a beach in New Hampshire at the turn of the last century, a young woman is drawn into a rocky, disastrous passage to adulthood. Olympia Biddeford is the only child of a prominent Boston couple--a precocious and well-educated daughter, alive with ideas and flush with the first stirrings of maturity. Her summer at the family's vacation home in Fortune's Rocks is transformed by the arrival of a doctor, a friend of her father's, whose new book about mill-town laborers has caused a sensation. Olympia is captivated by his thinking, his stature, and his drive to do right--even as she is overwhelmed for the first time by irresistible sexual desire. She and the doctor--a married man, a father, and nearly three times her age--come together in an unthinkable, torturous, hopelessly passionate affair. Throwing aside propriety and self-preservation, Olympia plunges forward with cataclysmic results that are the price of straying in an unforgiving era. Olympia is cast out of the world she knows, and Fortune's Rocks is the story of her determination to reinvent her broken life--and claim the one thing she finds she cannot live without. <br /><br />A meditation on the erotic life of women, an exploration of class prejudices, and most of all a portrayal of the thoughts and actions of an unforgettable young woman, Fortune's Rocks is a masterpiece of narrative drama, beautifully written by one of the most accomplished novelists of our time.",
