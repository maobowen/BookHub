    "description": "Philosopher, theologian, critic, sociologist, political activist -- Simone Weil was among the foremost thinkers of our time. Best known in this country for her theological writing, Weil wrote on a great variety of subjects ranging from classical philosophy and poetry, to modern labor, to the language of political discourse. The present anthology offers a generous collection of her work, including essays never before translated into English and many that have long been out of print. It amply confirms Elizabeth Hardwick's words that Simone Weil was \"one of the most brilliant and original minds of twentieth-century France\" and \"a woman of transcendent intellectual gifts and the widest learning.\" A longtime Weil scholar, Sian Miles has selected essays representative of the wide sweep of Weil's work and provides a superb introduction that places Weil's work in context of her life and times.",

    "description": "Egon Schiele (1890-1918) - along with Oskar Kokoschka - is the painter who had the most long-lasting influence on the Vienna art scene after the great era of Klimt came to a close. After a short flirtation with Klimt's style, Schiele soon questioned the aesthetic orientation to the beautiful surface of the Viennese Art Nouveau with his rough and not easily accessible paintings. Many contemporaries found his expressive nudes and self-portraits, with their strange movements and morbid colours, to be ugly and even morally objectionable - criticism which culminated in criminalizing the painter as \"obscene\" and resulted in 1912 in an indictment and short jail sentence. However, not even his harshest critics could dispute however the artist's extraordinary drawing talent.",

    "description": "<i>The Companion Species Manifesto</i> is about the implosion of nature and culture in the joint lives of dogs and people, who are bonded in \"significant otherness.\" In all their historical complexity, Donna Haraway tells us, dogs matter. They are not just surrogates for theory, she says; they are not here just to think with. Neither are they just an alibi for other themes; dogs are fleshly material-semiotic presences in the body of technoscience. They are here to live with. Partners in the crime of human evolution, they are in the garden from the get-go, wily as Coyote. This pamphlet is Haraway's answer to her own <i>Cyborg Manifesto</i>, where the slogan for living on the edge of global war has to be not just \"cyborgs for earthly survival\" but also, in a more doggish idiom, \"shut up and train.\"",

Lewis's acclaimed Space Trilogy, which continues with <i>Perelandra</i> and <i>That Hideous Strength, Out of the Silent Planet</i> begins the adventures of the remarkable Dr. Ransom. Here, that estimable man is abducted by a megalomaniacal physicist and his accomplice and taken via spaceship to the red planet of Malacandra. The two men are in need of a human sacrifice, and Dr. Ransom would seem to fit the bill. Once on the planet, however, Ransom eludes his captors, risking his life and his chances of returning to Earth, becoming a stranger in a land that is enchanting in its difference from Earth and instructive in its similarity. First published in 1943, <i>Out of the Silent Planet</i> remains a mysterious and suspenseful tour de force.",

    "description": "I was destined for a life of medical drama from day one,\" begins this comic memoir with a mission. \"I was born in the month of July, and my horoscope sign is a disease (Cancer). The symbol for Cancer? A crab (the sexually transmitted critter). Not only that, my parents named me Shawn Timothy Decker, which makes my initials S.T.D. <br /><br /> Shawn Decker isn't quite the all-American boy. Sure, he gets caught shoplifting copies of <i>Penthouse</i>, is crazy about pro wrestling, especially \"The Nature Boy\" Ric Flair, and never has a problem getting dates. But he's also a hemophiliac who discovers, at age eleven, that he has contracted HIV from tainted blood products. <br /><br /> Instead of becoming self-pitying and dying (as first predicted), Shawn develops a twisted sense of humor, meets Depeche Mode through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and writes on blogs and in Poz magazine about what it's like being hetero and HIV-positive in rural Virginia. He also turns to gay men for advice on dating women and, almost twenty years after getting HIV, marries Gwenn Barringer, who is HIV-negative and a former competitor for the title of Miss Virginia. Together Shawn and Gwenn travel the country, speaking to high school and college kids about how to live and love with HIV (and how to avoid getting it).",

    "description": "Written during the dark hours immediately before and during World War II, C. S. Lewis's Space Trilogy, of which <i>That Hideous Strength</i> is the third and final volume, stands alongside such works as Albert Camus's <i>The Plague</i> and George Orwell's <i>1984</i> as a timely parable that has become timeless, beloved by succeeding generations as much for the sheer wonder of its storytelling as for the significance of its moral concerns.<br /><br />The final book in C. S. Lewis's acclaimed Space Trilogy, which includes <i>Out of the Silent Planet</i> and <i>Perelandra, That Hideous Strength</i> concludes the adventures of the matchless Dr. Ransom. The dark forces that were repulsed in <i>Out of the Silent Planet</i> and <i>Perelandra</i> are massed for an assault on the planet Earth itself. Word is on the wind that the mighty wizard Merlin has come back to the land of the living after many centuries, holding the key to ultimate power for that force which can find him and bend him to its will. A sinister technocratic organization is gaining power throughout Europe with a plan to \"recondition\" society, and it is up to Ransom and his friends to squelch this threat by applying age-old wisdom to a new universe dominated by science. The two groups struggle to a climactic resolution that brings the Space Trilogy to a magnificent, crashing close.",

    "description": "Before his 1959 breakthrough, <i>Naked Lunch</i>, an unknown William S. Burroughs wrote <i>Junky</i>, his first novel. It is a candid eye-witness account of times and places that are now long gone, an unvarnished field report from the American post-war underground. Unafraid to portray himself in 1953 as a confirmed member of two socially-despised under classes (a narcotics addict and a homosexual), Burroughs was writing as a trained anthropologist when he unapologetically described a way of life - in New York, New Orleans, and Mexico City - that by the 1940's was already demonized by the artificial anti-drug hysteria of an opportunistic bureaucracy and a cynical, prostrate media. For this fiftieth-anniversary edition, eminent Burroughs scholar Oliver Harris has painstakingly recreated the author's original text, word by word, from archival typescripts and places the book's contents against a lively historical background in a comprehensive introduction. Here as well, for the first time, are Burroughs' own unpublished introduction and an entire omitted chapter, along with many \"lost\" passages, as well as auxiliary texts by Allen Ginsberg and others.",

    "description": "Israel's hippest bestselling young writer today, Etgar Keret is part court jester, part literary crown prince, part national conscience. <i>The Bus Driver Who Wanted to Be God</i> gathers his daring and provocative short stories for the first time in English.<br /><br />Brief, intense, painfully funny, and shockingly honest, Keret's stories are snapshots that illuminate with intelligence and wit the hidden truths of life. As with the best comic authors, hilarity and anguish are the twin pillars of his work. Keret covers a remarkable emotional and narrative terrain-from a father's first lesson to his boy to a standoff between soldiers caught in the Middle East conflict to a slice of life where nothing much happens. <br /><br />Bus Driver includes stories from Keret's bestselling collections in Israel, Pipelines and Missing Kissinger, as well as Keret's major new novella, \"Kneller's Happy Campers,\" a bitingly satirical yet wistful road trip set in the afterlife for suicides.<br />",

And if understanding the hierarchy of the Goldens vs. the Nons isn\u2019t hard enough, Lissy\u2019s ever growing Aura Vision is getting harder and harder to hide, and if she\u2019s not careful, she\u2019s going to become a Non faster than you can say \u201cfreak.\u201d<br /><br />But it\u2019s becoming clear that Emory High has a few secrets of its own. Around the halls, the term \u201cspecial powers\u201d goes way beyond one\u2019s ability to attract the opposite sex, and there may be something more evil than the A-crowd lurking in the classrooms. Lissy can see a lot more than the average girl, but she\u2019s about to learn the hard way that things aren\u2019t always as they appear and you can\u2019t always judge a girl by her lip gloss.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",

Her husband, Phil Graham was a brilliant and charismatic man whose plunge into manic depression and eventual suicide is recounted in this book. Above all, Katharine Graham tells her own story - the contradictions of her privileged yet lonely childhood; the tragic drama of her marriage - and the challenges of her new life as the head of a great newspaper company. An extraordinary frank, honest and generous book by one of America's most famous and admired women, owner of one of its greatest newspapers, the Washington Post. This is more than the mere life story of a successful woman. It deals with power and politics at the centre, and the relationship between the White House and the press, notably over Watergate.",

    "description": "When Lynda Lustig met Louie Milito, she was a sixteen-year-old high-school dropout with a taste for adventure and an agonizing childhood. When they were married two years later, he was not yet a \"made man\" in the powerful Gambino crime family. Louie was a hairdresser who dabbled in petty thievery. But Lynda was so happy to be out of her domineering mother's loveless house. And over the years, she was willing to forgive her husband for anything: his violent rages, his frequent absences, his shady associates, and the blood on his hands. For twenty-four years Lynda Milito remained loyal to this charming and dangerous criminal -- her children's father and close friend of crime boss John Gotti and underboss Sammy \"the Bull\" Gravano. But in 1988, Louie Milito disappeared, murdered by the very people he had always trusted to protect him.<br /><br />A crime story, a family story, a love story, Mafia Wife is the shockingly intimate, brutally honest tale of a survivor -- and of the life she lived in the dark bosom of the underworld.",

    "description": "From Steven Johnson, the dynamic thinker routinely compared to James Gleick, Dava Sobel, and Malcolm Gladwell, The Ghost Map is a riveting page-turner about a real-life historical hero, Dr. John Snow. It's the summer of 1854, and London is just emerging as one of the first modern cities in the world. But lacking the infrastructure -- garbage removal, clean water, sewers -- necessary to support its rapidly expanding population, the city has become the perfect breeding ground for a terrifying disease no one knows how to cure. As the cholera outbreak takes hold, a physician and a local curate are spurred to action-and ultimately solve the most pressing medical riddle of their time.<br /><br />In a triumph of multidisciplinary thinking, Johnson illuminates the intertwined histories and interconnectedness of the spread of disease, contagion theory, the rise of cities, and the nature of scientific inquiry, offering both a riveting history and a powerful explanation of how it has shaped the world we live in.",

In a world in which lives are shaped by irrevocable choices and by fortuitous events, a world in which everything occurs but once, existence seems to lose its substance, its weight. Hence, we feel \"the unbearable lightness of being\" not only as the consequence of our pristine actions but also in the public sphere, and the two inevitably intertwine.",

    "description": "Charlotte Bront\u00eb's impassioned novel is the love story of Jane Eyre, a plain yet spirited governess, and her arrogant, brooding Mr. Rochester. Published in 1847, under the pseudonym of Currer Bell, the book heralded a new kind of heroine\u2014one whose virtuous integrity, keen intellect and tireless perseverance broke through class barriers to win equal stature with the man she loved. Hailed by William Makepeace Thackeray as \"the masterwork of great genius,\" <i>Jane Eyre</i> is still regarded, over a century later, as one of the finest novels in English literature.",

    "description": "As the main spoken language of the Jews for more than a thousand years, Yiddish has had plenty to lament, plenty to conceal. Its phrases, idioms, and expressions paint a comprehensive picture of the mind-set that enabled the Jews of Europe to survive a millennium of unrelenting persecution: they never stopped <i>kvetching</i>---about God, gentiles, children, food, and everything (and anything) else. They even learned how to smile through their <i>kvetching</i> and express satisfaction in the form of complaint.<br />In <i>Born to Kvetch,</i> Michael Wex looks at the ingredients that went into this buffet of disenchantment and examines how they were mixed together to produce an almost limitless supply of striking idioms and withering curses (which get a chapter all to themselves). <i>Born to Kvetch</i> includes a wealth of material that's never appeared in English before. You'll find information on the Yiddish relationship to food, nature, divinity, and humanity. There's even a chapter about sex.<br />This is no <i>bobe mayse</i> (cock-and-bull story) from a <i>khokhem be-layle</i><b> </b>(idiot, literally a \"sage at night\" when no one's looking), but a serious yet fun and funny look at a language that both shaped and was shaped by those who spoke it. From <i>tukhes</i> to <i>goy,</i> <i>meshugener</i> to <i>kvetch</i>, Yiddish words have permeated and transformed English as well. <br />Through the idioms, phrases, metaphors, and fascinating history of this <i>kvetch-</i>full tongue, Michael Wex gives us a moving and inspiring portrait of a people, and a language, in exile.<br />",

    "description": "If you have ever wondered why women always bite your head off or why one guy gets all the girls, if you have ever pondered why some men bring you balloons while others leave you their genitals, then Dr Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation is the book for you. It explains all this and much more. It discloses the best time to have a sex change, how to have a virgin birth, when to seduce your sisters or eat your lover. Quirky and brilliant, it takes as its starting point all creatures great and small worried about their bizarre sex lives, and the letters they write to the wise Dr Tatiana, the only agony aunt in all creation with a prodigious knowledge of both natural history and evolutionary biology.",

And Winnie angrily determines that she must be the one to tell her daughter, Pearl, about the past--including the terrible truth even Helen does not know. And so begins Winnie's story of her life on a small island outside Shanghai in the 1920s, and other places in China during World War II, and traces the happy and desperate events that led to Winnie's coming to America in 1949. \"The kind of novel that can be read and reread with enormous pleasure.\" CHICAGO TRIBUNE",

    "description": "A bold expose of the controversial secret that has potentially dire consequences in many African American communities <br />Delivering the first frank and thorough investigation of life \"on the down low\" (the DL), J. L. King exposes a closeted culture of sex between black men who lead \"straight\" lives. King explores his own past as a DL man, and the path that led him to let go of the lies and bring forth a message that can promote emotional healing and open discussions about relationships, sex, sexuality, and health in the black community. <br />Providing a long-overdue wake-up call, J. L. King bravely puts the spotlight on a topic that has until now remained dangerously taboo. Drawn from hundreds of interviews, statistics, and the author's firsthand knowledge of DL behavior, \"On the Down Low \"reveals the warning signs African American women need to know. King also discusses the potential health consequences of having unprotected sex, as African American women represent an alarming 64 percent of new HIV infections. Volatile yet vital,\" On the Down Low \"is sure to be one of the most talked-about books of the year.",

Amongst Millbank\u2019s murderers and common thieves, Margaret finds herself increasingly fascinated by one apparently innocent inmate, the enigmatic spiritualist Selina Dawes. Selina was imprisoned after a s\u00e9ance she was conducting went horribly awry, leaving an elderly matron dead and a young woman deeply disturbed. Although initially skeptical of Selina\u2019s gifts, Margaret is soon drawn into a twilight world of ghosts and shadows, unruly spirits and unseemly passions, until she is at last driven to concoct a desperate plot to secure Selina\u2019s freedom, and her own.",

Sayers is considered by many to be the premier detective novelist of the Golden Age, and her dashing sleuth, Lord Peter Wimsey, one of mystery fiction\u2019s most enduring and endearing protagonists. Acclaimed author Ruth Rendell has expressed her admiration for Sayers\u2019s work, praising her \u201cgreat fertility of invention, ingenuity, and wonderful eye for detail.\u201d The third Dorothy L. Sayers classic to feature mystery writer Harriet Vane, <em>Gaudy Night</em> is now back in print with an introduction by Elizabeth George, herself a crime fiction master. <em>Gaudy Night </em>takes Harriet and her paramour, Lord Peter, to Oxford University, Harriet\u2019s alma mater, for a reunion, only to find themselves the targets of a nightmare of harassment and mysterious, murderous threats.",

Just days before they were to be married, his fianc\u00e9e called off the wedding. Luckily, his large support network of family and friends wouldn't let him succumb to his misery. They decided Franz should have a wedding and a honeymoon anyway- there just wouldn't be a bride at the ceremony, and Franz' travel companion would be his brother, Kurt.<br /><br />During the \"honeymoon,\" Franz reconnected with his brother and began to look at his life with newfound perspective. The brothers decided to leave their old lives behind them. They quit their jobs, sold all their possessions, and traveled around the world, visiting fifty-three countries for the next two years. In <i>Honeymoon With My Brother</i>, Franz recounts this remarkable journey, during which he turned his heartbreak into an opportunity to learn about himself, the world, and the brother he hardly knew.",

    "description": "From Slapstick's \"Turkey Farm\" to Slaughterhouse-Five's eternity in a Tralfamadorean zoo cage with Montana Wildhack, the question of the afterlife never left Kurt Vonnegut's mind. In God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian, Vonnegut skips back and forth between life and the Afterlife as if the difference between them were rather slight. In thirty odd \"interviews,\" Vonnegut trips down \"the blue tunnel to the pearly gates\" in the guise of a roving reporter for public radio, conducting interviews: with Salvatore Biagini, a retired construction worker who died of a heart attack while rescuing his schnauzer from a pit bull, with John Brown, still smoldering 140 years after his death by hanging, with William Shakespeare, who rubs Vonnegut the wrong way, and with socialist and labor leader Eugene Victor Debs, one of Vonnegut's personal heroes.<br />What began as a series of ninety-second radio interludes for WNYC, New York City's public radio station, evolved into this provocative collection of musings about who and what we live for, and how much it all matters in the end. From the original portrait by his friend Jules Feiffer that graces the cover, to a final entry from Kilgore Trout, God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian remains a joy.",

    "description": "Through Fanny Price, the heroine of Mansfield Park, Jane Austen views the social mores of her day and contemplates human nature itself. A shy and sweet-tempered girl adopted by wealthy relations, Fanny is an outsider looking in on an unfamiliar, and often inhospitable, world. But Fanny eventually wins the affection of her benefactors, endearing herself to the Bertram family and the reader alike.<br /><br />In her Introduction, Carol Shields writes, [Mansfield Park's] overriding theme is difficult to isolate, since the novel is about everything it touches upon: nurturing, steadfastness, belonging and not belonging, about fine gradations of moral persuasion, about human noise and silence, and about action and stillness.",

These can mostly be read as stand-alone in any order, but based on internal chronology <i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</i> is the first Poirot story and <i>Curtain</i> was written to be the final Poirot story and should be read last. Other points to note are:\n    \n    1. <i>Lord Edgware Dies</i> should be read before <i>After the Funeral</i>.\n    2. <i>Five Little Pigs</i> should be read before <i>Elephants Can Remember</i>.\n    3. <i>Cat Among the Pigeons</i> should be read before <i>Hallowe\u2019en Party</i>.\n    4. <i>Mrs McGinty\u2019s Dead</i> should be read before <i>Hallowe\u2019en Party</i> and <i>Elephants Can Remember</i>.\n    5. <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i> should be read before <i>Murder in Mesopotamia</i>.\n    6. <i>Three Act Tragedy</i> should be read before <i>Hercule Poirot\u2019s Christmas</i>.\n    \n    <i>Black Coffee</i> by Charles Osborne (#45 on this list) is a novelization of Agatha Christie's play of the same name (#7 on this list).\n    \n    The two volumes <i>Hercule Poirot: The Complete Short Stories</i> and <i>Hercule Poirot's Casebook</i> <b>BOTH</b> contain <b>ALL</b> of the Poirot short stories.\n    \n    Most of Book #38.1 \"The Under Dog and Other Stories\" stories can be found in book #38 \"Poirot's Early Cases\".\n    \n    Note that many books of Agatha Christie short stories contain a mixture of detectives. For example, <i>Problem at Pollensa Bay</i> contains 8 stories but only 2 feature Poirot.",

    "description": "<em>Give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread.</em> (Proverbs 30:8) One of the most difficult questions facing Christians today is that of the proper attitude toward possessions. In wealthy nations such as Britain and the USA, individuals accumulate much and yet are daily exposed to the plight of the poor, whether the homeless on their own city streets or starving children on their TV screens. What action should we take on behalf of the poor? What should we do with our own possessions? In this New Studies in Biblical Theology volume, Craig Blomberg asks what the Bible has to say about these issues. Avoiding easy answers, he instead seeks a comprehensive biblical theology of possessions. And so he begins with the groundwork laid by the Old Testament and the ideas developed in the intertestamental period, then draws out what the whole New Testament has to say on the subject, and finally offers conclusions and applications relevant to our contemporary world. <em>Neither Poverty Nor Riches</em> is one book that all should read who are concerned with issues of poverty and wealth. Addressing key issues in biblical theology, the works comprising New Studies in Biblical Theology are creative attempts to help Christians better understand their Bibles. The NSBT series is edited by D. A. Carson, aiming to simultaneously instruct and to edify, to interact with current scholarship and to point the way ahead.",

          "description": "Series Editor: D.A. Carson\n    \n    Addressing key issues in biblical theology, the works comprising New Studies in Biblical Theology focus on three areas:\n    \n    1. The nature and status of biblical theology, including its relationship to other disciplines.\n    2. The articulation and exposition of the structure of thought from a particular biblical writer or text.\n    3. The delineation of a biblical theme across the biblical corpus.\n    \n    While volume notes interact with the best of recent research, the text of each work is uncluttered with untransliterated Greek and Hebrew or too much specialist jargon. The volumes are written within the framework of confessional evangelicalism, but they also engage a variety of other relevant viewpoints and significant literature.\n    \n    Above all, these volumes are creative attempts to help Christians better understand their Bibles. New Studies in Biblical Theology aims simultaneously to instruct and to edify, to interact with current scholarship and to point the way ahead.\n    \n    This is a growing series and not yet complete. More volumes are forthcoming.",

    "description": "Maeve Binchy once again brings us an enchanting book full of the wit, warmth, and wisdom that have made her one of the most beloved and widely read writers at work today. <br />When a new highway threatens to bypass the town of Rossmore and cut through Whitethorn Woods, everyone has a passionate opinion about whether the town will benefit or suffer. But young Father Flynn is most concerned with the fate of St. Ann's Well, which is set at the edge of the woods and slated for destruction. People have been coming to St. Ann's for generations to share their dreams and fears, and speak their prayers. Some believe it to be a place of true spiritual power, demanding protection; others think it's a mere magnet for superstitions, easily sacrificed. Not knowing which faction to favor, Father Flynn listens to all those caught up in the conflict, and these are the voices we hear in the stories of \"Whitethorn Woods\"--men and women deciding between the traditions of the past and the promises of the future, ordinary people brought vividly to life by Binchy's generosity and empathy, and in the vivacity and surprise of her storytelling. <br />Maeve Binchy is at the very top of her form in this irresistible tale.",

    "description": "First published in 1976, Paul Johnson\u2019s exceptional study of Christianity has been loved and widely hailed for its intensive research, writing, and magnitude\u2014\u201ca tour de force, one of the most ambitious surveys of the history of Christianity ever attempted and perhaps the most radical\u201d (<i>New York Review of Books</i>).<br /><br />In a highly readable companion to books on faith and history, the scholar and author Johnson has illuminated the Christian world and its fascinating history in a way that no other has. Johnson takes off in the year 49 with his namesake the apostle Paul. Thus beginning an ambitious quest to paint the centuries since the founding of a little-known \u2018Jesus Sect\u2019, A History of Christianity explores to a great degree the evolution of the Western world. With an unbiased and overall optimistic tone, Johnson traces the fantastic scope of the consequent sects of Christianity and the people who followed them. Information drawn from extensive and varied sources from around the world makes this history as credible as it is reliable. Invaluable understanding of the framework of modern Christianity\u2014and its trials and tribulations throughout history\u2014has never before been contained in such a captivating work.",

    "description": "Martin Marty?professor, author, pastor, historian, and journalist?is, in Bill Moyers's words, ?the most influential interpreter of American religion.? In \"Martin Luther\" this man of unswerving faith, rooted in his own Lutheran tradition yet deeply committed to helping enrich a pluralist society, brings to powerful life the devout Reformation figure whose despair for a perilous world, felt anew in our own times, drove him to a ceaseless search for assurance of God's love. It was one that led him steadily to a fresh interpretation of human interaction with God?as born solely from God's grace and not the Church's mediation?and to the famous theses he posted at Wittenberg in 1517. Luther's persistence in this belief, and in his long battle with Church leaders?embellished by rich historical background?make Marty's biography riveting reading. Luther's obdurate yet receptive stance, so different from the travestied image of ?fundamentalism? we currently face, restored the balance between religion and the individual. \"Martin Luther\" is at once a fascinating history, a story of immense spiritual passion and amazing grace, and a superb intellectual biography.",

    "description": "This \"fresh, blunt, and highly persuasive account of how the West was won\u2014for Jesus\" (<em>Newsweek</em>) is now available in paperback. Stark's provocative report challenges conventional wisdom and finds that Christianity's astounding dominance of the Western world arose from its offer of a better, more secure way of life.<br /><br />\"Compelling reading\" (<em>Library Journal</em>) that is sure to \"generate spirited argument\" (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>), this account of Christianity's remarkable growth within the Roman Empire is the subject of much fanfare. \"Anyone who has puzzled over Christianity's rise to dominance...must read it.\" says Yale University's Wayne A. Meeks, for <em>The Rise of Christianity</em> makes a compelling case for startling conclusions. Combining his expertise in social science with historical evidence, and his insight into contemporary religion's appeal, Stark finds that early Christianity attracted the privileged rather than the poor, that most early converts were women or marginalized Jews\u2014and ultimately \"that Christianity was a success because it proved those who joined it with a more appealing, more assuring, happier, and perhaps longer life\" (Andrew M. Greeley, University of Chicago).",

    "description": "Ireland's patron saint has long been shrouded in legend, but the true story of St. Patrick is far more inspiring than the myths. In <i>St. Patrick of Ireland,</i> Philip Freeman brings the historic Patrick and his world vividly to life. Patrick speaks in his own voice in two remarkable letters he wrote about himself and his beliefs, new translations of which are included here and which are still astonishing for their passion and eloquence. <br /> Born late in the fourth century to an aristocratic British family, Patrick's life was changed forever when he was abducted and taken to Ireland just before his sixteenth birthday. He spent six grueling years there as a slave, but the ordeal turned him from an atheist into a true believer. After a vision in which God told him he would go home, Patrick escaped captivity and, following a perilous journey, returned safely to Britain to the amazement of his family. But even more amazing to them was his announcement that he intended to go back to Ireland to spend the rest of his life ministering to the people who had once enslaved him. <br /> Set against the turbulent backdrop of the British Isles during the last years of the Roman Empire, <i>St. Patrick of Ireland</i> brilliantly brings to life the real Patrick, shorn of legend, a man whose deep spiritual conviction and devotion helped to transform a country.",

    "description": "Winner of a Christianity Today 2005 Book Award! The word evangelical is widely used and widely misunderstood. Where did evangelicals come from? What motivated them? How did their influence become so widespread throughout the world during the eighteenth century? This inaugural book, in a series that charts the course of English-speaking evangelicalism over the last 300 years, offers a multinational narrative of the origin, development and rapid diffusion of evangelical movements in their first two generations. Theology, hymnody, gender, warfare, politics and science are all taken into consideration. But the focus is on the landmark individuals, events and organizations that shaped the story of the beginnings of this vibrant Christian movement. The revivals in Britain and North America in the mid-eighteenth century proved to be foundational in the development of the movement, its ethos, beliefs and subsequent direction. In these revivals, the core commitments of evangelicals were formed that continue to this day. In this volume you will find the fascinating story of their formation, their strengths and their weaknesses, but always their dynamism.",

    "description": "Though in all things God's Word is the final authority, our Christian tradition, as inherited from centuries of careful reflection and endeavoring to be true to the teaching of Scripture, can greatly enlighten us. Nowhere is this blend of respectful listening to the wisdom of the past and faithfulness to the Bible more necessary than in our contemporary reformulations of the doctrine of God's person.<br /><br />Bruce Ware believes that while tradition's emphasis on God's metaphysical perfection and His supremacy over the world is correct, we must refine our understanding of the way in which He relates to us. While retaining the deepest concerns of the historic tradition, Ware offers a more rational view of God's dealings with His children-a view that is reflected in Scripture's own testimony of Him. Ware then applies this concept of real divine exaltation and real divine-human relationship to the areas of our prayer life, confidence in God and His guidance of us.",

    "description": "Remembrance of Things Past<br />\"I find myself wanting to translate the world inside...\"<br /><br />Sagesse LaBasse, the teenage protagonist of Claire Messud's <i>The Last Life</i>, lives in a fragile world held together by the secrets of its past. Her family owns the Hotel Bellevue, a summer retreat for the well-to-do, set on the cliffs of southern France; the view is back toward Algeria, which her paternal grandparents fled during its struggle for independence from France. As her grandmother laments, \"Every morning, I wake up and look out my window at the Mediterranean sea, vast and creeping, and I smell the pines and the heat on the breeze, rising up the clifftop, and I'm in Algiers again. I live, still, in my heart, in Algeria.\" <br /><br />The loss of their homeland is always present to the LaBasses, and the consequent search for identity both reflects and compounds other difficulties. Sagesse's father (\"fleshy, ingratiating, explosive\") languishes under his own father's control, and is often unfaithful to Sagesse's mother, an American who tries to pass as French. Meanwhile, their young son, Etienne, is so severely mentally and physically impaired that his birth is likened to \"the clanging of their prison door.\" Sagesse's grandmother looks on with cool resignation, and her grandfather, the family's hot-headed patriarch, will let no one rest. When, late one night, the old man fires his rifle into a group of children swimming at the hotel's pool, no one is seriously injured, but the family's livelihood is put at risk, and long-simmering resentments find an outlet.<br /><br />Sagesse is the perfect narrator for this fractured situation. She is neither French, nor American; not a girl, yet not quite a woman. Her grandfather's rash act causes her to lose her friends at school, and she is forced to \"seek out the very pot-smokers I had...readily disparaged little over a month before.\" These new friends, upon realizing her family's past (having been French colonists, they are suspected of being racists, and members of the National Front) and relative wealth, also abandon her. With guests trickling away from the hotel, and tensions rising within the LaBasse family, Sagesse tries to understand what remains, and what place there might be for her. <br /><br />Fortunately, while her life may be painful, she never finds it dull. Sagesse's language is rich and evocative, full of descriptive power. Here, for example, she witnesses the market: \"There were vegetable men and fruit women and stalls selling both, blushing mounds of peaches alongside plump and purple eggplants...pale, splayed organs of fennel pressing their ridged tubes and feathered ends up against the sugar-speckled, wrinkled carcasses of North African dates...the fishmongers sold their bullet-eyed, silver-skinned, slippery catch, blood-streaked fillets and orbed, scored steaks, milky scallops and encrusted oysters....\" And here, a painting of the Bay of Algiers: \"its apron of azure sea, erratically white-capped, broken by the sandstone finger of the port...the white rise of the city, a thousand precise terraces and roofs climbing into the sunlit sky, the European curlicues and the higgledy-piggledy casbah, all their outlines drawn as if with a single hair, interspersed with delicate little palms and cypresses and other trees of variegated greens, and with broad, brown avenues like branches.\"<br /><br />A brilliant, complex world is formed by the accretion of these images, and they are juxtaposed and spur each other seamlessly, multiplying atmosphere and complicating plot lines. While most of the novel's events take place around 1990, Sagesse tells of them from a time almost a decade later (when she is a graduate student of the \"history of ideas\" at Columbia). This frame, constructed of occasional asides and short passages, allows a fluidity where revelations from the past and future cause momentum to shift and whirl -- the dead rise, their movements sharper and words more portentous with the reader's knowledge of coming tragedy. This later perspective also enables Sagesse to add deft hints and wise commentary. Looking back on herself, for instance, she says, \"Children do not have words to ask and so do not imagine asking; not asking and not imagining, they eradicate distance: they take for granted that everything, someday, will be understood.\"<br /><br /><i>The Last Life</i> stands as a testament to reflection, to making sense of an unruly past. It is also a kind of autobiography, an attempt to constitute an identity. In its ebb and flow of images, action, and ideas, the narrative deals so well with this attempt, implicitly, that it's unfortunate that it must also be treated explicitly. Frequent asides concerning identity and the nature of the self (\"the one thing that would not leave me: the only and inadequate definition of my 'I.'\") seem unnecessary; they lure Sagesse into self-dramatization, and contain the novel's most uneven prose. Some readers may find that such self-analysis helps characterize the narrator, but it's difficult to believe the story wouldn't be stronger without it. <br /><br />Still, the novel's concern with such weighty questions is representative of its, and Sagesse's, fearlessness. As she seeks the truth about her family and herself, she also reflects on politics and race, dreaming of a \"Mediterranean culture democratic and polyphonous\" while simultaneously acknowledging its impossibility. This seeming contradiction must be borne, she learns, since to blindly accept what has happened is to forget alternatives and to repeat mistakes. \"I live as if this might-have-been existed,\" she writes, \"shimmering in the imaginary; and if it is but an 'as if,' I have learned, then it is none the less real for that.\"<br /><br /><i>The Last Life</i> ultimately concerns itself with questions of fate and self-determination. In a world of disasters, Sagesse wonders if and how they might have been avoided: \"The abiding question...was it fate? Is our ending inscribed in our beginning -- and, if so, in whose beginning?\" The \"obvious answer,\" she says, is that we cannot escape our fate, that our choices are illusory. The richness found in her story, however, suggests the less obvious answer -- that we might affect our fate, and better confront the present and future, if we work to come to an understanding with our past.",

    "description": "This unique volume brings together four of Moli re's greatest verse comedies covering the best years of his prolific writing career. Actor, director, and playwright, Moli re (1622-73) was one of the finest and most influential French dramatists, adept at portraying human foibles and puncturing pomposity. The School for Wives was his first great success; Tartuffe, condemned and banned for five years, his most controversial play. The Misanthrope is his acknowledged masterpiece, and The Clever Women his last, and perhaps best-constructed, verse piece. In addition this collection includes a spirited attack on his enemies and a defense of his theater, in the form of two sparkling short plays, The School for Wives Criticized and The Impromptu at Versailles.",

Life gets more interesting, however, when his father becomes the Buddha of Suburbia, beguiling a circle of would-be mystics. And when the Buddha falls in love with one of his disciples, the beautiful and brazen Eva, Karim is introduced to a world of renegade theater directors, punk rock stars, fancy parties, and all the sex a young man could desire. A love story for at least two generations, a high-spirited comedy of sexual manners and social turmoil, <i>The Buddha of Suburbia</i> is one of the most enchanting, provocative, and original books to appear in years.",

Several sections have been added, including a new chapter on postmodernism. At other points the discussion has been updated, and some portions of the original have been condensed, since the issues they originally dealt with are no longer as crucial as they once were. Also new to the second edition are a number of educational refinements, including chapter objectives, chapter summaries, and study questions.",

    "description": "Widely considered the most popular modern French play, <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i> has dazzled audiences with its wit and eloquence since it premiered in 1897.<br />Cyrano, a quarrelsome, hot-tempered swordsman, as famous for his dueling skills and pugnacity as for his inordinately long nose, is hopelessly enamored of the beautiful Roxane. She, in turn, is in love with Christian, a handsome but inarticulate and slow-witted suitor. Asked for help by Christian in wooing Roxane, Cyrano pours out his heart in romantic dialogues \u2014 delivered under cover of night and dense foliage \u2014 and through ardent love letters written in the name of Christian.<br />Presented here in a rich blank verse translation by poet Louis Untermeyer, this beloved romantic comedy will be warmly received by theater buffs as well as students and teachers of drama and literature.",

    "description": "What does it mean to write \"This is not a pipe\" across a bluntly literal painting of a pipe? Ren\u00e9 Magritte's famous canvas provides the starting point for a delightful homage by French philosopher and historian Michel Foucault. Much better known for his incisive and mordant explorations of power and social exclusion, Foucault here assumes a more playful stance. By exploring the nuances and ambiguities of Magritte's visual critique of language, he finds the painter less removed than previously thought from the pioneers of modern abstraction.",

He draws on decades of thinking and teaching about the church as well as from his committed leadership and ministry within the church. Biblical, historical, systematic and Reformed, <em>The Church</em> is a timely and provocative reflection on the life, order and purpose of the household of God.",

    "description": "Just why do humpback whales sing? That's the question that has marine behavioral biologist Nate Quinn and his crew poking, charting, recording, and photographing very big, wet, gray marine mammals. Until the extraordinary day when a whale lifts its tail into the air to display a cryptic message spelled out in foot-high letters: Bite me.<br /><br />Trouble is, Nate's beginning to wonder if he hasn't spent just a little too much time in the sun. 'Cause no one else on his team saw a thing -- not his longtime partner, Clay Demodocus; not their saucy young research assistant; not even the spliff-puffing white-boy Rastaman Kona (n\u00e9 Preston Applebaum). But later, when a roll of film returns from the lab missing the crucial tail shot -- and his research facility is trashed -- Nate realizes something very fishy indeed is going on.<br /><br />By turns witty, irreverent, fascinating, puzzling, and surprising, <em>Fluke</em> is Christopher Moore at his outrageous best.",

Coupland recently has been compared to Jack Kerouac and F. Scott Fitzgerald, yet he is a man firmly grounded in the current era. The novel is a sizzling and sharp-witted entertainment that resounds with eternal human yearnings.<br /><br />In the opening pages, 65-year-old Janet Drummond checks the clock in her cheap motel room near Cape Canaveral, takes her prescription pills and does a rapid tally of the whereabouts of her three children: Wade, the eldest, in and out of jail and still radiating \u201dthe glint\u201d; suicidal Bryan, whose girlfriend, the vowel-free Shw, is pregnant; and Sarah, the family\u2019s shining light, an astronaut preparing to be launched into space as the star of a shuttle mission. They will all arrive in Orlando today \u2013 along with Janet\u2019s ex-husband Ted and his new trophy wife \u2013 setting the stage for the most disastrous family reunion in the history of fiction. Florida may never recover from their version of fun in the sun. <br /><br />The last time the family got together, there was gunplay and an ensuing series of HIV infections. Now, what should be a celebration turns instead into a series of mishaps and complications that place the family members in constant peril. When the reformed Wade attempts to help his dad out of a financial jam and pay off his own bills at the fertility clinic, his plan spins quickly out of control. Adultery, hostage-taking, a letter purloined from Princess Diana\u2019s coffin, heart attacks at Disney World, bankruptcy, addiction and black-market negotiations \u2013 Coupland piles on one deft, comic plot twist after another, leaving you reaching for your seat belt. When the crash comes, it is surprisingly sweet. <br /><br />Janet contemplates her family, and where it all went wrong. \u201cPeople are pretty forgiving when it comes to other people's family. The only family that ever horrifies you is your own.\u201d During the writing, Coupland described the book as being about \u201cthe horrible things that families do to each other and how it makes them strong.\u201d He commented: \u201cFamilies who are really good to each other, I\u2019ve noticed, tend to dissipate, so I wonder how awful a family would have to be to stick together.\u201d <br /><br />Coupland\u2019s first novel, <i>Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture</i>, became a cultural phenomenon, affixing a buzzword and a vocabulary to a generation and going on to sell over a million copies. The novels that followed were all bestsellers, and his work has continued to show a fascination with the digital, brand-conscious, media-dense culture of contemporary North American society, leading some to peg him as \u201can up-to-the-minute cultural reference engine.\u201d Meanwhile, his deeper interests in how human beings function in this spiritual vacuum have become increasingly apparent. For example, the character Wade contemplates his father: \u201cWhat <i>would</i> the world have to offer Ted Drummond, and the men like him, a man whose usefulness to the culture had vanished somewhere around the time of Windows 95? Golf? Gold? Twenty-four hour stock readouts?\u201d Janet, on the other hand, nears a kind of peace with life: \u201cTime erases both the best and the worst of us.\u201d <i>All Families Are Psychotic </i>shows Coupland being just as concerned for the grown-ups as for the kids.",

Moorehead's experience living and working with refugees puts a human face on the news, providing unforgettable portraits of the refugees she meets in Cairo, Guinea, Sicily, Lebanon, England, Australia, Finland, and at the U.S.-Mexico border. <i>Human Cargo</i> changes our understanding of what it means to have and lose a place in the world, and reveals how the refugee \"problem\" is on a par with global crises such as terrorism and world hunger.",

    "description": "When her once-glamorous and witty novelist-mother got Alzheimer's, Eleanor Cooney moved her from her beloved Connecticut home to California in order to care for her. In tense, searing prose, punctuated with the blackest of humor, Cooney documents the slow erosion of her mother's mind, the powerful bond the two shared, and her own descent into drink and despair.<br /><br />But the coping mechanism that finally serves this eloquent writer best is writing, the ability to bring to vivid life the memories her mother is losing. As her mother gropes in the gathering darkness for a grip on the world she once loved, succeeding only in conjuring sad fantasies of places and times with her late husband, Cooney revisits their true past. Death in Slow Motion becomes the mesmerizing story of Eleanor's actual childhood, straight out of the pages of John Cheever; the daring and vibrant mother she remembers; and a time that no longer exists for either of them.",

    "description": "Wouldn't you love to abolish the IRS ...<br />Keep all the money in your paycheck ...<br />Pay taxes on what you spend, not what you earn ...<br />And eliminate all the fraud, hassle, and waste of our current system?<br /><br />Then the FairTax is for you. In the face of the outlandish American tax burden, talk-radio firebrand Neal Boortz and Congressman John Linder are leading the charge to phase out our current, unfair system and enact the FairTax Plan, replacing the federal income tax and withholding system with a simple 23 percent retail sales tax on new goods and services. This dramatic revision of the current system, which would eliminate the reviled IRS, has already caught fire in the American heartland, with more than six hundred thousand taxpayers signing on in support of the plan.<br /><br />As Boortz and Linder reveal in this first book on the FairTax, this radical but eminently sensible plan would end the annual national nightmare of filing income tax returns, while at the same time enlarging the federal tax base by collecting sales tax from every retail consumer in the country. The FairTax, they argue, would transform the fearsome bureaucracy of the IRS into a more transparent, accountable, and equitable tax collection system. Among other benefits, it will:<br /><br /><br />Make America's tax code truly voluntary, without reducing revenue<br />Replace today's indecipherable tax code with one simple sales tax<br />Protect lower-income Americans by covering the tax on basic necessities<br />Eliminate billions of dollars in embedded taxes we don't even know we're paying<br />Bring offshore corporate dollars back into the U.S. economy<br />Endorsed by scores of leading economists and supported by a huge and growing grassroots movement, the FairTax Plan could revolutionize the way America pays for itself. In this straight-talking book, Neal Boortz and John Linder show you how it would work\u2014and how you can help make it happen.",

    "description": "From the \"New York Times\" Bestselling author of \"Running With Scissors\" comes the story of one man trying to out-drink his memories, outlast his demons, and outrun his past. <br /> \"I was addicted to \"Bewitched\" as a kid. I worshipped Darren Stevens the First. When he'd come home from work and Samantha would say, 'Darren, would you like me to fix you a drink?' He'd always rest his briefcase on the table below the mirror in the foyer, wipe his forehead with a monogrammed handkerchief and say, 'Better make it a double.'\" (from Chapter Two) <br />You may not know it, but you've met Augusten Burroughs. You've seen him on the street, in bars, on the subway, at restaurants: a twentysomething guy, nice suit, works in advertising. Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had two drinks, Augusten was circling the drain by having twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. Loud, distracting ties, automated wake-up calls and cologne on the tongue could only hide so much for so long. At the request (well, it wasn't really a request) of his employers, Augusten lands in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey Jr. are immediately dashed by grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers. But when Augusten is forced to examine himself, something actually starts to click and that's when he finds himself in the worst trouble of all. Because when his thirty days are up, he has to return to his same drunken Manhattan life--and live it sober. What follows is a memoir that's as moving as it is funny, as heartbreaking as it is true. \"Dry \"is the story of love, loss, and Starbucks as a Higher Power. <br />",

    "description": "<p><b>The tenth anniversary edition of this landmark cookbook, with more than 325,000 copies in print, includes a new introduction from Deborah Madison, America\u2019s leading authority on vegetarian cooking.<br /><br /></b>What Julia Child is to French cooking, Deborah Madison is to vegetarian cooking\u2014a demystifier and definitive guide to the subject. After her many years as a teacher and writer, she realized that there was no comprehensive primer for vegetarian cooking, no single book that taught vegetarians basic cooking techniques, how to combine ingredients, and how to present vegetarian dishes with style. <i>Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone</i> teaches readers how to build flavor into vegetable dishes, how to develop vegetable stocks, and how to choose, care for, and cook the many vegetables available to cooks today. <i>Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone</i> is in every way Deborah Madison\u2019s magnum opus, featuring 1,400 recipes suitable for committed vegetarians, vegans (in most cases), and everyone else who loves good food. For nonvegetarians, the recipes can be served alongside meat, fish, or fowl and incorporated into a truly contemporary style of eating that emphasizes vegetables and fruits for health and well-being.<br /><br /><i>Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone</i> is the most comprehensive vegetarian cookbook ever published. The recipes, which range from appetizers to desserts, are colorful and imaginative as well as familiar and comforting. Madison introduces readers to innovative main course salads; warm and cold soups; vegetable braises and cobblers; golden-crusted gratins; Italian favorites like pasta, polenta, pizza, and risotto; savory tarts and galettes; grilled sandwiches and quesadillas; and creative dishes using grains and heirloom beans. At the heart of the book is the A-to-Z vegetable chapter, which describes the unique personalities of readily available vegetables, the sauces and seasonings that best complement them, and the simplest ways to prepare them. \u201cBecoming a Cook\u201d teaches cooking basics, from holding a knife to planning a menu, and \u201cFoundations of Flavor\u201d discusses how to use sauces, herbs, spices, oils, and vinegars to add flavor and character to meatless dishes. In each chapter, the recipes range from those suitable for everyday dining to dishes for special occasions. And through it all, Madison presents a philosophy of cooking that is both practical and inspiring.<br /><br />Despite its focus on meatless cooking, <i>Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone</i> is not just for vegetarians\u2014it's for everyone interested in learning how to cook vegetables creatively, healthfully, and passionately. The recipes are remarkably straightforward, using easy-to-find ingredients in inspiring combinations. Some are simple, others more complex, but all are written with an eye toward the seasonality of produce. Madison's joyful and free-spirited approach to cooking will send you into the kitchen with confidence and enthusiasm. Whether you are a kitchen novice or an experienced cook, this wonderful cookbook has something for everyone.</p>",

    "description": "<b>The underappreciated presidency of the military man who won the Civil War and then had to win the peace as well</b><br /><br />As a general, Ulysses S. Grant is routinely described in glowing terms-the man who turned the tide of the Civil War, who accepted Lee's surrender at Appomattox, and who had the stomach to see the war through to final victory. But his presidency is another matter-the most common word used to characterize it is \"scandal.\" Grant is routinely portrayed as a man out of his depth, whose trusting nature and hands-off management style opened the federal coffers to unprecedented plunder. But that caricature does not do justice to the realities of Grant's term in office, as Josiah Bunting III shows in this provocative assessment of our eighteenth president.<br /><br />Grant came to Washington in 1869 to lead a capital and a country still bitterly divided by four years of civil war. His predecessor, Andrew Johnson, had been impeached and nearly driven from office, and the radical Republicans in Congress were intent on imposing harsh conditions on the Southern states before allowing them back into the Union. Grant made it his priority to forge the states into a single nation, and Bunting shows that despite the troubles that characterized Grant's terms in office, he was able to accomplish this most important task-very often through the skillful use of his own popularity with the American people. Grant was indeed a military man of the highest order, and he was a better president than he is often given credit for.",

Schlesinger, Jr.\n    \n    Times Books, an imprint of Henry Holt and Company, is the publisher of the landmark series <a href=\"http://www.americanpresidentsseries.com/\">The American Presidents</a>. The acclaimed presidential historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., served as general series editor until his death in February 2007. Sean Wilentz, the distinguished Princeton University historian, has taken over the reins as series editor. It is the aim of the series to present the grand panorama of our chief executives in volumes compact enough for the busy reader, lucid enough for the scholar. Each volume will be an incisive, meditation-length biographical essay that focuses on the subject's presidency, even as it offers a distillation of his life, character, and career.\n    \n    To undertake the biographies of the American Presidents, Times Books has engaged a wide variety of distinguished contributors, including Garry Wills on James Madison, John Dean on Warren G. Harding, Douglas Brinkley on Gerald R.

    "description": "Debbie does crochet! Debbie Stoller, the \u201cknitting superstar,\u201d has been leading an entire movement of hip young knitters with her <i>New York Times</i> bestseller<i> Stitch \u2019n Bitch</i> and its follow-up, <i>Stitch \u2019n Bitch Nation</i>, together with over 521,000 copies in print. But guess what?

    "description": "Joseph Nye coined the term \"soft power\" in the late 1980s. It is now used frequently\u2014and often incorrectly\u2014by political leaders, editorial writers, and academics around the world. So what is soft power? Soft power lies in the ability to attract and persuade. Whereas hard power\u2014the ability to coerce\u2014grows out of a country's military or economic might, soft power arises from the attractiveness of a country's culture, political ideals, and policies.<br /><br /> Hard power remains crucial in a world of states trying to guard their independence and of non-state groups willing to turn to violence. It forms the core of the Bush administration's new national security strategy. But according to Nye, the neo-conservatives who advise the president are making a major miscalculation: They focus too heavily on using America's military power to force other nations to do our will, and they pay too little heed to our soft power. It is soft power that will help prevent terrorists from recruiting supporters from among the moderate majority. And it is soft power that will help us deal with critical global issues that require multilateral cooperation among states. That is why it is so essential that America better understands and applies our soft power. This book is our guide.",

    "description": "<b>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for History</b><br /><b></b><br /><b>'Read it. It will open your eyes about race history in America. It will shock you for what it tells you about politics in America today.' <i>Richard Ford</i></b><br /><br /><b><i>'</i>A remarkably wide-ranging synthesis of the history of the 1850s and the Civil War ... that effectively integrates in one volume social, political and military events from the immediate aftermath of the Mexican War through the sectional strife of the 1850s, the secession movement, and the Civil War ... It is a masterful work' <i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br /><br /><b><i>'</i>Compellingly readable ... the best one-volume treatment of its subject I have ever come across. It may be the best ever published ... This is magic' <i>The New York Times</i></b><br /><br />This book covers one of the most turbulent periods of the USA's history, from the Mexican War in 1848 to the end of the Civil War in 1865. With a broad historical sweep, it traces the heightening sectional conflict of the 1850s: the growing estrangement of the South and its impassioned defence of slavery; the formation of the Republican Party in the North, with its increasing opposition to slavery; and the struggle over territorial expansion, with its accompanying social tensions and economic expansion. The whole panorama of the Civil War is captured in these pages, from the military campaign, which is described with vividness, immediacy, a grasp of strategy and logistics, and a keen awareness of the military leaders and the common soldiers involved, to its political and social aspects.",

Fifteen years have gone by since those glory days, and Neely has come home to Messina to bury Coach Eddie Rake, the man who molded the Spartans into an unbeatable football dynasty.<br /><br />As Coach Rake's 'boys' sit in the bleachers waiting for the dimming field lights to signal his passing, they replay the old glories, and try to decide once and for all whether they love Eddie Rake <b>\u2013</b> or hate him. For Neely Crenshaw, still struggling to come to terms with his explosive relationship with the Coach, his dreams of a great career in the NFL, and the choices he made as a young man, the stakes could not be higher.",

In Biloxi, Mississippi, a landmark tobacco trial with hundreds of millions of dollars at stake begins routinely, then swerves mysteriously off course. <br /><br />The jury is behaving strangely, and at least one juror is convinced he's being watched. Soon they have to be sequestered. Then a tip from an anonymous young woman suggests she is able to predict the jurors' increasingly odd behavior. <br /><br />Is the jury somehow being manipulated, or even controlled? If so, by whom? And, more importantly, why?<br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",

The Big Show gives you the honest, horrifying, yet always entertaining story of two men, three cameras, and highlights run amok: that voodoo that Keith and Dan do to make The Big Show run slicker than Pat Riley's \"do\"; Keith's controversial list of should-be baseball Hall of Famers (100 of them, for Pete's sake); Dan and Keith's on-air flubs - errors that make even Bill Buckner's blunder seem minor; and Keith and Dan's complaints about sports idiocies - and each other!",

Spin us a yarn.\"<br />Instantly, Phoebe Winterbottom came to mind. \"I could tell you an extensively strange story,\" I warned.<br />\"Oh, good!\" Gram said. \"Delicious!\"<br />And that is how I happened to tell them about Phoebe, her disappearing mother, and the lunatic.<br /><br />As Sal entertains her grandparents with Phoebe's outrageous story, her own story begins to unfold \u2014 the story of a thirteen-year-old girl whose only wish is to be reunited with her missing mother.<br /><br />In her own award-winning style, Sharon Creech intricately weaves together two tales, one funny, one bittersweet, to create a heartwarming, compelling, and utterly moving story of love, loss, and the complexity of human emotion.",

From the first time mankind had an inkling of the vast space that surrounds us, those who study the universe have had to struggle against political and religious preconceptions. They have included some of the most charismatic, courageous, and idiosyncratic thinkers of all time. In <em>Coming of Age in the Milky Way,</em> Timothy Ferris uses his unique blend of rigorous research and captivating narrative skill to draw us into the lives and minds of these extraordinary figures, creating a landmark work of scientific history.",

    "description": "Jessica Darling is up in arms again in this much-anticipated, hilarious sequel to Sloppy Firsts. This time, the hyperobservant, angst-ridden teenager is going through the social and emotional ordeal of her senior year at Pineville High. Not only does the mysterious and oh-so-compelling Marcus Flutie continue to distract Jessica, but her best friend, Hope, still lives in another state, and she can\u2019t seem to escape the clutches of the Clueless Crew, her annoying so-called friends. To top it off, Jessica\u2019s parents won\u2019t get off her butt about choosing a college, and her sister Bethany\u2019s pregnancy is causing a big stir in the Darling household.<br /><br />With keen intelligence, sardonic wit, and ingenious comedic timing, Megan McCafferty again re-creates the tumultuous world of today\u2019s fast-moving and sophisticated teens. Fans of Sloppy Firsts will be reunited with their favorite characters and also introduced to the fresh new faces that have entered Jess\u2019s life, including the hot creative writing teacher at her summer college prep program and her feisty, tell-it-like-it-is grandmother Gladdie. But most of all, readers will finally have the answers to all of their burgeoning questions, and then some: Will Jessica crack under the pressure of senioritis? Will her unresolved feelings for Marcus wreak havoc on her love life? Will Hope ever come back to Pineville? Fall in love with saucy, irreverent Jessica all over again in this wonderful sequel to a book that critics and readers alike hailed as the best high school novel in years.",

It is philosophical and it is cheery. What we suppose we are trying fumblingly to say is, in a word, that it is Thurber.<br /><br />There are only a few reasons why everybody has always wanted to read this kind of story: if you have always wanted to love a Princess; if you always wanted to be a Prince; if you always wanted the wicked Duke to be punished; or if you always wanted to live happily ever after. Too little of this kind of thing is going on in the world today. But all of it is going on valorously in <i>The 13 Clocks</i>.",

    "description": "Right after high school, Joe Goffman left sleepy Bush Falls, Connecticut and never looked back. Then he wrote a novel savaging everything in town, a novel that became a national bestseller and a huge hit movie. Fifteen years later, Joe is struggling to avoid the sophomore slump with his next novel when he gets a call: his father's had a stroke, so it's back to Bush Falls for the town's most famous pariah. His brother avoids him, his former classmates beat him up, and the members of the book club just hurl their copies of Bush Falls at his house. But with the help of some old friends, Joe discovers that coming home isn't all bad--and that maybe the best things in life are second chances.<br /><br />Fans of Nick Hornby and Jennifer Weiner will love this book, by turns howling funny, fiercely intelligent, and achingly poignant. As evidenced by <b>The Book of Joe's</b> success in both the foreign and movie markets, Jonathan Tropper has created a compelling, incredibly resonant story.",

All signs being auspicious, the villagers triumphantly assured Sampath's proud parents that their son was destined for greatness. <br /><br />Twenty years of failure later, that unfortunately does not appear to be the case. A sullen government worker, Sampath is inspired only when in search of a quiet place to take his nap. \"But the world is round,\" his grandmother says. \"Wait and see Even if it appears he is going downhill, he will come up the other side. Yes, on top of the world. He is just taking a longer route.\" No one believes her until, one day, Sampath climbs into a guava tree and becomes unintentionally famous as a holy man, setting off a series of events that spin increasingly out of control. A delightfully sweet comic novel that ends in a raucous bang, <i>Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard</i> is as surprising and entertaining as it is beautifully wrought.",

    "description": "The open ocean--that vast expanse of international waters--spreads across three-fourths of the globe. It is a place of storms and danger, both natural and manmade. And at a time when every last patch of land is claimed by one government or another, it is a place that remains radically free.<br /><br />With typically understated lyricism, William Langewiesche explores this ocean world and the enterprises--licit and illicit--that flourish in the privacy afforded by its horizons. But its efficiencies are accompanied by global problems--shipwrecks and pollution, the hard lives and deaths of the crews of the gargantuan ships, and the growth of two pathogens: a modern and sophisticated strain of piracy and its close cousin, the maritime form of the new stateless terrorism.<br /><br />This is the outlaw sea that Langewiesche brings startlingly into view. The ocean is our world, he reminds us, and it is wild.",

Their dislike encompasses the rest of the known universe, and England's soccer thugs express it in ways that range from mere vandalism to riots that terrorize entire cities. Now Bill Buford, editor of the prestigious journal Granta, enters this alternate society and records both its savageries and its sinister allure with the social imagination of a George Orwell and the raw personal engagement of a Hunter Thompson.",

Is there a heaven? Is there a true connection and communication between the living and the dead?</b><br /><br />Allison DuBois invites us into her world where she delivers messages from our lost loved ones. She convinces us that those who have passed away are constantly with us, providing comfort, love, and support. They are as eager to reach us as we are to stay connected with them.<br /><br />But the dead have a language of their own. They communicate through signs, dreams, songs, coincidences, and messages delivered in unexpected ways. Allison takes us on an odyssey of these signs \u2014 how to recognize them, how to read them, and how to interpret them. In these pages, you will meet people who have had both heartbreaking and heartwarming communication with the other side, providing comforting proof that our deceased loved ones stay with us and continue to share in the joys of our lives.",

    "description": "In this best-selling new book, his first in seventeen years, Robert M. Pirsig, author of <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>, takes us on a poignant and passionate journey as mysterious and compelling as his first life-changing work. <br /><br />Instead of a motorcycle, a sailboat carries his philosopher-narrator Phaedrus down the Hudson River as winter closes in. Along the way he picks up a most unlikely traveling companion: a woman named Lila who in her desperate sexuality, hostility, and oncoming madness threatens to disrupt his life.<br /><br />In <i>Lila</i> Robert M. Pirsig has crafted a unique work of adventure and ideas that examines the essential issues of the nineties as his previous classic did the seventies.",

    "description": "Set in famine-stricken 1930s China, <i>Rice</i> chronicles the complete debasement of a city family after it takes in a young man named Five Dragons, a starving wanderer from the provinces whose desire for power and sex is insatiable. In this mesmerizing novel, Su Tong, China's most provocative young writer, explores the connections between hunger, sexuality, and brutality. Rice is used as food and currency, as an aphrodisiac and an implement of sexual torture, as a weapon for murder and a symbol of everything good. Lush and sensual, combining a strange comedy with a dark undercurrent of violence, and written in hypnotically beautiful prose, <i>Rice</i> is a novel of startling richness and furious creative energy.",

Why does she have to go to the Isle of Mona to train as a proper lady when she's already a princess? But Eilonwy soon faces much more than the ordeal of becoming a dignified young maiden, for she possesses magical powers sought by the evil enchantress Queen Achren.

Yet how can a lowly Assistant Pig-Keeper hope to stand against the most evil enchantress in all of Prydain?",

    "description": "Taran is an Assistant Pig-Keeper no longer; he has become a hero. Now he dreams of winning the hand of the Princess Eilonwy. Eager to find his origins, Taran sets off with the faithful Gurgi on a quest across the marvelous land of Prydain. Their journey takes them to the three witches in the Marshes of Morva, through the many realms of Prydain, and finally to the mystical Mirror of Llunet, which may hold a truth about Taran's identity that he cannot bear to face. In the course of his travels, Taran will learn much about his world and the good and bad people in it, but will also discover much about himself. <br /><br />After many hard lessons, Taran learns the secret of the Mirror Llunet and of the past--and finds not an ending but a beginning.",

    "description": "The plot of <i>Washington Square</i> has the simplicity of old-fashioned melodrama: a plain-looking, good-hearted young woman, the only child of a rich widower, is pursued by a charming but unscrupulous man who seeks the wealth she will presumably inherit. On this premise, Henry James constructed one of his most memorable novels, a story in which love is answered with betrayal and loyalty leads inexorably to despair.\" <p> -- from the Introduction by Peter Conn </p><p> In <i>Washington Square</i> (1880), Henry James reminisces about the New York he had known thirty years before as he tells the story of Catherine Sloper and her fortune-seeking suitor Morris Townsend. This perceptively drawn human drama is James' most accessible work and an enduring literary triumph. </p><p> Washington Square Press' Enriched Classics present the great works of world literature enhanced for the contemporary reader. This edition of <i>Washington Square</i> has been prepared by Peter Conn, Andrea Mitchell Professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania. It includes his introduction, notes, selection of critical excerpts, and suggestions for further reading as well as a unique visual essay of period illustrations and photographs.</p>",

The Castillo brothers, workers by day, become, by night, stars of the dance halls, where their orchestra plays the sensuous, pulsing music that earns them the title of the Mambo Kings. This is a golden time that thirty years later will be remembered with deep affection. In The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love, Oscar Hijuelos has created an enthralling novel about passion and loss, memory and desire.This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.",

    "description": "Anne Sexton began writing poetry at the age of twenty-nine to keep from killing herself. She held on to language for dear life and somehow -- in spite of alcoholism and the mental illness that ultimately led her to suicide -- managed to create a body of work that won a Pulitzer Prize and that still sings to thousands of readers. This exemplary biography, which was nominated for the National Book Award, provoked controversy for its revelations of infidelity and incest and its use of tapes from Sexton's psychiatric sessions. It reconciles the many Anne Sextons: the 1950s housewife; the abused child who became an abusive mother; the seductress; the suicide who carried \"kill-me pills\" in her handbag the way other women carry lipstick; and the poet who transmuted confession into lasting art.",

Ghosts of the past lurk everywhere, whispering of future war. Justin and his revolutionaries denounce the monarchy--even the benevolent Mickle.

    "description": "<i>Table of Contents </i>is a collection of eight pieces that range from Alaska to New Jersey, describing, for example, the arrival of telephones in a small village near the Arctic Circle and the arrival of wild bears in considerable numbers in New Jersey, swarming in from the Poconos in search of a better life (\"Riding the Boom Extension,\" \"A Textbook Place for Bears\").<br /><br />In \"North of the C.P. Line\" the author introduces his friend John McPhee, a bush-pilot fish-and-game warden in northern Maine, who is also a writer. The two men met after the flying warden wrote to <i>The New Yorker </i>complaining that someone was using his name. Maine also is the milieu of \"Heirs of General Practice,\" McPhee's highly acclaimed report\u2014virtually a book in itself\u2014on the new medical specialty called family practice. Much of it takes place in the examining rooms of a dozen young physicans in various rural communities, where they are seen in the context of their work with a great many patients of all ages.<br /><br />Two relatively short pieces revisit the subjects of earlier McPhee books. \"Ice Pond\" demonstrates anew the innovative genius of the physicist Theodore B. Taylor, who developed a way of making and using with impressive results in the conservation of the electrical energy. \"Open Man\" describes a summer day in New Jersey in the company of Senator Bill Bradley.<br /><br />In \"Minihydro,\" various small-scale entrepreneurs in New York State set up turbines at nineteenth-century mill sites and sell electricity to power companies. A nice little country waterfall can earn as much as two hundred dollars a year for someone with such a turbine. And, \"Under the Snow,\" McPhee Goes back into black bear's dens in Pensylvania in winter, where he becomes intoxicated with affection for some five-pound cubs. They remind him of his daughters.",

Davies explores unanswered questions such as: <br /> * Does the universe have a beginning and an end?<br /> * Is the passage of time merely an illusion?<br /> * Is it possible to travel backward -- or forward -- in time? <br /><i>About Time</i> weaves physics and metaphysics in a provocative contemplation of time and the universe.",

A fictional editor's note tells of an encounter with an author and illustrator named Harris Burdick, who provided the images and captions as samples, each from a different picture book he had written. He left with a promise to deliver the complete manuscripts if the editor chose to buy the books. Burdick was never seen again, and the samples are all that remain of his supposed books. Readers are challenged to imagine their own stories based on the images in the book.</p><p></p>",

    "description": "Chez Panisse is a restaurant in Berkeley, California, run by Alice Waters and her large group of friends. Her daughter Fanny's stories of this busy place are a friendly and funny introduction to the delights of real restaurant life, and her recipes show how easy and inexpensive it is to make good food with basic ingredients and simple techniques. Opening up the magic world of cooking to children, Alice Waters describes, in the words of seven-year-old Fanny, the path food travels from the garden to the kitchen to the table. Teaching kids where food really comes from not just from the market but from farms and people who care about the earth, Fanny at Chez Panisse has lessons on the importance of eating with your hands, of garlic and of composting and recycling. It is also a delightful beginner's cookbook with 46 recipes that will tempt children into the desire to cook and eat with whole hearts, alert minds and all the senses. From banana milkshakes and green apple sherbet to cherry tomato pasta and black beans and sour cream, as well as spaghetti and meatballs, french fries and pizza, there is something here for every child to prepare and enjoy.",

    "description": "2002 Gold Medallion Award winner! Sensible advice and caring encouragement on raising boys from the nation's most trusted parenting expert, Dr.James Dobson. With so much confusion about the role of men in our society, it's no wonder so many parents and teachers are at a loss about how to bring up boys. Our culture has vilified masculinity and, as a result, boys are suffering. Parents, teachers, and others involved in shaping the character of boys have lots of questions. In \"Bringing Up Boys, \" Dr. Dobson tackles these questions and offers advice and encouragement based on a firm foundation of biblical principles.",

The very sight and sound of Kikuyu tribal life presented here are at once comprehensive and intimate, and as precise as they are compassionate.",

    "description": "Written around 1245 by an unknown author, the Laxdaela Saga is an extraordinary tale of conflicting kinships and passionate love, and one of the most compelling works of Icelandic literature. Covering 150 years in the lives of the inhabitants of the community of Laxriverdale, the saga focuses primarily upon the story of Gudrun Osvif's-daughter: a proud, beautiful, vain and desirable figure, who is forced into an unhappy marriage and destroys the only man she has truly loved - her husband's best friend. A moving tale of murder and sacrifice, romance and regret, the Laxdaela Saga is also a fascinating insight into an era of radical change - a time when the Age of Chivalry was at its fullest flower in continental Europe, and the Christian faith was making its impact felt upon the Viking world.",

    "description": "Do you believe that spending $15,000 on a media center is vulgar, but that spending $15,000 on a slate shower stall is a sign that you are at one with the Zenlike rhythms of nature? Do you work for one of those visionary software companies where people come to work wearing hiking boots and glacier glasses, as if a wall of ice were about to come sliding through the parking lot? If so, you might be a Bobo. <br /> In his bestselling work of \"comic sociology,\" David Brooks coins a new word, <i>Bobo,</i> to describe today's upper class -- those who have wed the bourgeois world of capitalist enterprise to the hippie values of the bohemian counterculture. Their hybrid lifestyle is the atmosphere we breathe, and in this witty and serious look at the cultural consequences of the information age, Brooks has defined a new generation.",

    "description": "\"Immensely witty...thoroughly entertaining.\"--<i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br /><br />Paul Trilby is having a bad day. If he were to be honest with himself, Paul Trilby would have to admit that he's having a bad life. His wife left him. Three subsequent girlfriends left him. He's fallen from a top-notch university teaching job, to a textbook publisher, to, eventually, working as a temp writer for the Texas Department of General Services. And even here, in this land of carpeted partitions and cheap lighting fixtures, Paul cannot escape the curse his life has become. For it is not until he begins a tentative romance with the office's sassy mail girl that he begins to notice things are truly wrong. Strange sounds come from the air conditioning vents, the ceiling bulges, a body disappears. Mysterious men lurk about town, wearing thick glasses and pocket protectors...<br /><br />Kings of Infinite Space is a hilarious and horrifying spoof on our everyday lives and gives true voice to the old adage, \"Work is Hell.\"",

    "description": "The subject of John Singer Sargent's most famous painting was twenty-three-year-old New Orleans Creole Virginie Gautreau, who moved to Paris and quickly became the \"it girl\" of her day. A relative unknown at the time, Sargent won the commission to paint her; the two must have recognized in each other a like-minded hunger for fame.<br /><br />Unveiled at the 1884 Paris Salon, Gautreau's portrait generated the attention she craved-but it led to infamy rather than stardom. Sargent had painted one strap of Gautreau's dress dangling from her shoulder, suggesting either the prelude to or the aftermath of sex. Her reputation irreparably damaged, Gautreau retired from public life, destroying all the mirrors in her home.<br /><br />Drawing on documents from private collections and other previously unexamined materials, and featuring a cast of characters including Oscar Wilde and Richard Wagner, Strapless is a tale of art and celebrity, obsession and betrayal.",

    "description": "In this funny and big-hearted story by the author of The Secret Lives of Fortunate Wives, three best friends make a pact to transform themselves into the glamorous women they've always wanted to be. <br /><br />Nola Devlin has a secret identity. By day she is an overweight, frumpy, and overlooked editor at Sass! (the \"celebrity magazine with an edge!\"), but by night she slips behind her keyboard and into her alter-ego: Belinda Apple. Belinda is thin, gorgeous, British and the author of a trendy advice column- she is, in effect, the latest Carrie Bradshaw. Not even Nola's two best friends or her self-absorbed sister (who worships Belinda as the \"sister she never had\") know her secret.<br />When \"Belinda\" jots off a column about how easy it is to lose weight, Nola is shocked when her best friends take her own lies to heart and urge her to follow Belinda's weight loss program. Since Nola can't reveal herself as the real Belinda Apple, she bites the bullet and joins her friends in making the \"Cinderella Pact\"- a last ditch attempt to lose weight (again!) and transform their lives for good.<br /><br />But as the pounds come off, things don't turn out the way the three friends expect. Their journey of self-discovery leads to the return of an old love and the unmasking of new problems. Meanwhile, Nola finds herself torn between two different men as she stomps out fires caused by her deception as Belinda Apple and falls in love with the man who just might be her prince - or the rat in coachman's clothing.",

In <i>Cute, Quaint, Hungry and Romantic,</i> the writer whom Steven Millhauser called \"the most original essayist since George Orwell\" examines with devastating wit and in a style distinctly his own the contagious appeal of that which is not art, the uses of the useless, the politics of product design and advertising. Here is a psychic voyage into the aesthetic unconscious of the consumer, as well as \"the perfect companion for any foray through Restoration Hardware or the freezer compartment at Dean &amp; DeLuca\" (<i>Village Voice Literary Supplement</i>). From teddy bears to Mars Bars to Leonardo DiCaprio, this is the refuse of consumerism unflinchingly\u2014and very entertainingly\u2014observed.",

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \"social\") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.",

    "description": "Sarah, Harriet and Boris are outcasts searching for solace in their own private fantasy worlds. Mourning the recent death of her best friend, Marshall, Sarah tries to find comfort in the countless horror movies she loves. Harriet, Marshall's mother, grieves by immersing herself in the serenity of her farm. Then there is Boris. A sixteen-year-old orphan with dreams of writing the ultimate zombie novel, he spends his nights sneaking away from a youth home and his days dreaming of Rex, a beautiful but savage classmate. It is this fascination that sets in motion a violent chain of events that ultimately tests the boundaries of the three misfits' obsessions and leads the novel to its brutal and startling conclusion. \"Nimble, alarming, complex, and lushly written.\"<br />-- \"New York Post\"<br /><br />\"Elegantly written.\"<br />-- \"Time Out New York\"<br /><br />\"[Heim] teases out the pleasures of cruelty in language that scalpels one minute, unfurls lushly the next.\"<br /> \"Village Voice\"<br /><br />\"Grand, uncanny, horrific and sweet. . . . Those who give themselves to it will be haunted.\"<br />-- \"Lambda Book Report\"<br /><br />\"Unforgettable. . . . Quite simply, In Awe is awesome: inordinately powerful and alarming, terrifying and breathtaking. A transcendent, bittersweet novel of obsession and pain, love and loathing, memory and desire. Heim is testing the limits of his dynamic, raw vision.\"<br />- \"Kansas City Star\"<br /><br />\"The ripple of danger beneath the surface of Scott Heim's In Awe should serve as a warning to anyone expecting a casual ride: this is a book that means to take you places. A patina of malevolence overhangs Heim's Kansas, and even the quietest moments can have the most terrifying consequences for his trio ofmisfits, Boris, Sarah, and Harriet. The story draws us forward toward its heart like the best of spiderwebs.\"<br />--Jim Grimsley",

    "description": "<i>\u2018One swallow does not make a summer; neither does one day. Similarly neither can one day, or a brief space of time, make a man blessed and happy\u2019</i><br /><br />In the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, Aristotle sets out to examine the nature of happiness. He argues that happiness consists in \u2018activity of the soul in accordance with virtue\u2019, for example with moral virtues, such as courage, generosity and justice, and intellectual virtues, such as knowledge, wisdom and insight. <i>The Ethics</i> also discusses the nature of practical reasoning, the value and the objects of pleasure, the different forms of friendship, and the relationship between individual virtue, society and the State. Aristotle\u2019s work has had a profound and lasting influence on all subsequent Western thought about ethical matters.<br /><br />J. A. K. Thomson\u2019s translation has been revised by Hugh Tredennick, and is accompanied by a new introduction by Jonathan Barnes. This edition also includes an updated list for further reading and a new chronology of Aristotle\u2019s life and works.<br /><br />Previously published as <i>Ethics</i>",

Phineas Poe, disgraced cop and morphine addict, has just been released from a psych ward when he meets a beautiful woman named Jude in a hotel bar. Red dress, black hair, body like a knife. He takes her back to his room and wakes the next morning in a bathtub full of blood and ice, missing a kidney.<br /><br />Dragging himself from a hospital bed, Phineas discovers he wants to be with Jude like a hunger -- and he wants to find her and kill her. Falling for her is the start of a twisted love story that takes him from the snowy streets of Denver to the high plains of Texas where the boundaries between torturer and victim, killer and accomplice, become nightmarishly distorted.",

    "description": "Widely read for its insights into history and politics, <i>The Prince</i> is one of the most provocative works of the Italian Renaissance. Based on Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli\u2019s observations of the effectiveness of both ancient and contemporary statesmen, the rules for governing set forth in his manual were considered radical and harsh by his contemporaries and shocking to many since then. This major new edition combines an accurate and accessible new translation with important related documents, many of which appear here in English for the first time. In his lucid introductory essay, William J. Connell offers fresh insights into Machiavelli\u2019s life, the meaning of his work, the context in which it was written, and its influence over time. Document headnotes, maps, a chronology of Machiavelli\u2019s life, questions for consideration, a selected bibliography, and index provide further pedagogical support.",

Virtually impossible to find before it\u2019s too late.The job falls to Liz Carlyle, the most resourceful counter terror agent in British intelligence. Tracking down this invisible is a challenge like none she has faced before. It will require all her hard-won experience, to say nothing of her intelligence and courage. Drawing on her own years as Britain's highest-ranking spy, Stella Rimington gives us a story that is smart, tautly drawn, and suspenseful from first to last.",

    "description": "On the 26th of March 2005, <i>Doctor Who</i> returned to our screens after an absence of 16 years, with a new Doctor, a new assistant and thirteen thrilling new adventures. This book collects together the entire shooting scripts for the first series. Seven of the scripts are by Russell T Davies, with the remainder by Steven Moffat, Robert Shearman, Paul Cornell and <i>The League of Gentlemen</i>'s Mark Gatiss. Each story contains the essential ingredients of time travel, adventure, and the mixing of the ordinary with the fantastical that have always characterized the series, while at the same time being thoroughly in tune with contemporary culture and society. This is a <i>Doctor Who</i> for an age defined by irony, technology and celebrity, and the shadow cast by 9/11. It is also cinematic, with fast cutting and special effects that will satisfy viewers brought up on contemporary film and television sci-fi. The shooting scripts give a unique insight into how the first series was visualized and acted. Alongside the exciting action sequences and dialogue are hints about the characters' emotions, and evocations of the settings in which their adventures take place.<br /><br />Pacey, atmospheric and thoroughly absorbing, these scripts practically read like novels. Each of the scripts is illustrated with full-colour screen grabs, ensuring the book appeals to broad audience. Introductions by the writers explain the inspirations for the first series and the fascinating process of creating a <i>Doctor Who</i> script. As the one book that ties directly into the first series, this is a must-have self-purchase or gift for all <i>Doctor Who </i>fans.",

    "description": "\"It was a dark, blustery afternoon in spring, and the city of London was chasing a small mining town across the dried-out bed of the old North Sea.\"<br /><br />The great traction city London has been skulking in the hills to avoid the bigger, faster, hungrier cities loose in the Great Hunting Ground. But now, the sinister plans of Lord Mayor Mangus Crome can finally unfold.<br /><br />Thaddeus Valentine, London's Head Historian and adored famous archaeologist, and his lovely daughter, Katherine, are down in The Gut when the young assassin with the black scarf strikes toward his heart, saved by the quick intervention of Tom, a lowly third-class apprentice. Racing after the fleeing girl, Tom suddenly glimpses her hideous face: scarred from forehead to jaw, nose a smashed stump, a single eye glaring back at him. \"Look at what your Valentine did to me!\" she screams. \"Ask him! Ask him what he did to Hester Shaw!\" And with that she jumps down the waste chute to her death. Minutes later Tom finds himself tumbling down the same chute and stranded in the Out-Country, a sea of mud scored by the huge caterpillar tracks of cities like the one now steaming off over the horizon.<br /><br />In a stunning literary debut, Philip Reeve has created a painful dangerous unforgettable adventure story of surprises, set in a dark and utterly original world fueled by Municipal Darwinism -- and betrayal.",

Alison and her stepbrother, Roger, discover that the flowery patterns on the plates, when traced onto paper, can be fitted together to create owls-owls that disappear when no one is watching. With each vanished owl, strange events begin to happen around Alison, Roger, and the caretaker's son, Gwyn. As the kids uncover the mystery of the owl service, they become trapped within a local legend, playing out roles in a tragic love story that has repeated itself for generations... a love story that has always ended in disaster.",

He takes them into the caves of Fundindelve, where he watches over the enchanted sleep of one hundred and forty knights. But the heart of the magic that binds them - Firefrost, also known as the Weirdstone of Brisingamen - has been lost. The Wizard has been searching for the stone for more than 100 years, but the forces of evil are closing in, determined to possess and destroy its special power. Colin and Susan realise at last that they are the key to the Weirdstone's return. But how can two children defeat the Morrigan and her deadly brood?",

But money is the least of their worries when a mysterious man bursts into their office and offers Tim a wad of cash for his coat. Minutes later, the stranger is dead and Nick and Tim are left to puzzle over his final words. What could he have meant by \"suff bee suff-iss\"? Or was it \"south by southeast\"? Neither one seems to make much sense, but the Diamond brothers will have to figure it out, and fast! Whoever killed the stranger is now after Nick and Tim!",

One ordinary sort of morning they receive a correspondence informing them that a gentleman is on his way to visit, a Mr Webster. Visitors to Larklight are rare if not unique, and a frenzy of preparation ensues. But it is entirely the wrong sort of preparation, as they discover when their guest arrives, and a Dreadful and Terrifying (and Marvellous) adventure begins. It takes them to the furthest reaches of Known Space, where they must battle the evil First Ones in a desperate attempt to save each other - and the Universe. Recounted through the eyes of Art himself, Larklight is sumptuously designed and illustrated throughout.",

Eclipses can be accurately forecast centuries in advance. Nuclear power plants generate electricity according to well-known formulas. But those examples are the tip of the iceberg. In <i>Nature's Numbers</i>, Ian Stewart presents many more, each charming in its own way.. Stewart admirably captures compelling and accessible mathematical ideas along with the pleasure of thinking of them. He writes with clarity and precision. Those who enjoy this sort of thing will love this book.\"\u2014<i>Los Angeles Times</i>",

When he became involved in a conspiracy and was imprisoned in Pavia, it was to the Greek philosophers that he turned. THE CONSOLATION was written in the period leading up to his brutal execution. It is a dialogue of alternating prose and verse between the ailing prisoner and his 'nurse' Philosophy. Her instruction on the nature of fortune and happiness, good and evil, fate and free will, restore his health and bring him to enlightenment. THE CONSOLATION was extremely popular throughout medieval Europe and his ideas were influential on the thought of Chaucer and Dante.",

    "description": "Just when it seems that there cannot possibly be another twist to the Harry Potter tale, Stephen Fry dons his haughtiest and naughtiest tones to bring <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i> to vibrant life on audio.<p> Harry Potter has spent the first 10 years of his life at the mercy of the dreadful Dursleys--the aunt, uncle and fat, spoilt brat of a cousin who reluctantly gave him a home after the death of his mother and father. But on his 11th birthday Harry discovers that he is no ordinary boy, and despite the best efforts of his hideous relatives he escapes to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to begin his new life as a trainee wizard. And the rest, as they say, is history...</p><p> As Harry battles against the evils thrown in his path, Stephen Fry injects the proceedings with a wry, dry and extremely contagious humour that perfectly suits the tale, wringing out the best in Harry and his cohorts as they get to grips with their new lives at the sharp end of Hogwarts. Fry's innate upper-class drone is perfectly suited to the telling of this most magical tale, cracking into the high-pitched squawking of Hermione the swat, or the gentle tones of the firm but fair Dumbledore, or the evil sniping of slimey Snape at precisely the right moments. </p><p> <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i> is a fine story and much has been written about its success but until you have heard Fry's cracking reading of this most magical of stories then you simply haven't lived. As with any audio book, this one is perfect for car journeys and an ideal way of introducing reluctant readers to the magic that is Harry Potter. (Ages 9 and over) <i>--Susan Harrison</i></p>",

Philip's death while on safari soon after their wedding left Emily feeling little grief, for she barely knew the dashing stranger.<br /><br />But her discovery of his journals nearly two years later reveals a far different man than she imagined-a gentleman scholar and antiquities collector who apparently loved his new wife deeply. Emily's desire to learn more about her late husband leads her through the quiet corners of the British Museum and into a dangerous mystery involving rare stolen artifacts. To complicate matters, she's juggling two very prominent and wealthy suitors, one of whose intentions may go beyond matrimony into darker realms.",

Alluring, witty, and resourceful, she attracted the king's lust and, though much in love with the handsome Thomas Seymour, was thrown into the intrigue-filled snakepit of the royal court. While victims of the king's wrath suffered torture and execution, Catherine withstood the onslaught, even when Henry sought to replace her with wife number seven. She survived her royal husband, and found happiness with Seymour---but it was shadowed by rivalry with the young Princess Elizabeth, whose affection Seymour coveted. Catherine won the contest, but at great cost.",

    "description": "This is a book about Wilco and the pictorial, literary, and musical world it conjures up on record and in performance. Created in collaboration with Jeff Tweedy, Wilco, and Tony Margherita, this primarily visual book explores what Wilco does, how it does it, and where it all comes together. The band narrates the book in the form of long captions accompanying a variety of images: a Korean postcard, a Stratocaster, a backstage practice session, and so on. Along the way, central topics such as instruments, touring, and recording are covered both in general (i.e., what happens, physically, when a guitar string breaks) and specific to Wilco. Just as the band assembles its disparate talents and inspirations to make music, this book coheres in the end to reveal a 40 minute CD of original, unreleased songs. Just as Wilco experiments with music by turning convention on its head, this book is an utterly new take on the old genre of the rock 'n' roll book. <i>The Wilco Book</i> will look and read like a Wilco record sounds; it's a translation of the band's sensibility from sound into print.",

    "description": "<b>The intimate story of one of the great American bands of our time, creators of the controversial masterpiece <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i><br /><br /></b>When alt-country heroes-turned-rock-iconoclasts Wilco handed in their fourth album, <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i>, to the band\u2019s label, Reprise, a division of Warner Brothers, fans looked forward to the release of another challenging, genre-bending departure from their previous work. The band aimed to build on previous sales and critical acclaim with its boldest and most ambitious album yet, but was instead urged by skittish Reprise execs to make the record more \u201cradio friendly.\u201d When Wilco wouldn\u2019t give, they found themselves without a label. Instead, they used the Internet to introduce the album to their fans, and eventually sold the record to Nonesuch, another division of Warner. Wilco was vindicated when the album debuted at No. 13 on the <i>Billboard</i> charts and posted the band\u2019s strongest sales to date. <br /><b>\n  <br /></b><i>Wilco: Learning How to Die</i> traces the band\u2019s story to its deepest origins in Southern Illinois, where Jeff Tweedy began growing into one of the best songwriters of his generation. As we witness how his music grew from its punk and alt-country origins, some of the key issues and questions in our culture are addressed: How is music of substance created while the gulf between art and commerce widens in the corporate consolidation era? How does the music industry make or break a hit? How do working musicians reconcile the rewards of artistic risk with the toll it exacts on their personal life? <br /><br />This book was written with the cooperation of Wilco band members past and present.\u00a0 It is also fully up to date, covering the latest changes in personnel and the imminent release of the band\u2019s fifth album, <i>A Ghost Is Born</i>, sure to be one of the most talked-about albums of 2004.",

    "description": "<i>JPod</i>, Douglas Coupland's most acclaimed novel to date, is a lethal joyride into today's new breed of tech worker. Ethan Jarlewski and five co-workers whose surnames begin with \"J\" are bureaucratically marooned in jPod, a no-escape architectural limbo on the fringes of a massive Vancouver game design company. The jPodders wage daily battle against the demands of a boneheaded marketing staff, who daily torture employees with idiotic changes to already idiotic games. Meanwhile, Ethan's personal life is shaped (or twisted) by phenomena as disparate as Hollywood, marijuana grow-ops, people-smuggling, ballroom dancing, and the rise of China. <i>JPod</i>'s universe is amoral, shameless, and dizzyingly fast-paced like our own. <br /><br />Praise for JPod: \"JPod is a sleek and necessary device: the finely tuned output of an author whose obsolescence is thankfully years away.\"-New York Times Book Review\"It's to [Coupland's] credit that in JPod he's still nimble enough to take the post-modern man-too young for Boomer nostalgia and too old for youthful idealism-and drown his sorrows in a willful, joyful satire that revels in the same cultural conventions that it sends up.\"-Rocky Mountain News <br />\"It's time to admire [Coupland's] virtuoso tone and how he has refined it over 11 novels. The master ironist just might redefine E. M. Forster's famous dictate 'Only connect' for the Google age.\"-USA Today <br />\"Zeitgeist surfer Douglas Coupland downloads his brain into JPod.\"-Vanity Fair <br />",

    "description": "The Story of San Michele (a villa built on the ruins of a Roman Emperor's villa in Capri) is a series of overlapping vignettes, roughly but not entirely in chronological order. It contains reminiscences of many periods of the author's life. He associated with a number of celebrities of his times, including Jean-Martin Charcot, Louis Pasteur, Henry James, and Guy de Maupassant, all of whom figure in the book. He also associated with the very poorest of people, including Italian immigrants in Paris and plague victims in Naples, as well as rural people such as the residents of Capri, and the Nordic Lapplanders. He was an unabashed animal lover, and animals figure prominently in several stories, perhaps most notably his alcoholic pet baboon, Billy.<br /><br />The stories cover a wide range in terms of both how serious they are and how literal. Several discussions with animals and various supernatural beings take place, and the final chapter actually takes place after Munthe has died and includes his discussions with Saint Peter at the gates of Heaven. At no point does Munthe seem to take himself particularly seriously, but some of the things he discusses are very serious, such as his descriptions of rabies research in Paris, including euthanasia of human patients, and a suicide attempt by a man convinced he had been exposed to the disease.<br /><br />Several of the most prominent figures in Munthe's life are not mentioned in Story of San Michele. His wife and children do not figure in the narrative; very little of his time in England is mentioned, even though he married a British woman, his children were largely raised in England, and he himself became a British citizen during the First World War. His decades-long service as personal physician and confidante to the Queen of Sweden is mentioned only in the most oblique terms; at one point, while naming her only as \"she who must be mother to a whole nation\", he mentions that she regularly brings flowers for the grave of one of her dogs buried at Villa San Michele, at another point, one of his servants is out walking his dogs, and encounters the Queen, who mentions having given the dog to Munthe.<br /><br />Munthe published a few other reminiscences and essays during the course of his life, and some of them were incorporated into The Story of San Michele, which vastly overshadows all his other writing both in length and popularity. Notably, his accounts of working with a French ambulance corps during the First World War are not included.<br /><br />World wide, the book was immensely successful; by 1930, there had been twelve editions of the English version alone, and Munthe added a second preface. A third preface was written in 1936 for an illustrated edition",

But nothing in his career has prepared Carter for the greatest stunt of all, which stars none other than President Warren G.

Filled with historical references that evoke the excesses and exuberance of Roaring Twenties, pre-Depression America, <i>Carter Beats the Devil</i> is a complex and illuminating story of one man's journey through a magical\u2014and sometimes dangerous\u2014world, where illusion is everything.",

    "description": "The Little White Bird is a series of short episodes with tones ranging from fantasy and whimsy to social comedy with dark aggressive undertonesm. It accounts the narrator's day to day activities in London of its day, and fanciful tales set in Kensington Gardens and elsewhere. This book also includes the very first appearance of Peter Pan.<br /><br />Excerpt:<br />If you ask your mother whether she knew about Peter Pan when she was a little girl she will say, \"Why, of course, I did, child,\" and if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days she will say, \"What a foolish question to ask, certainly he did.\" Then if you ask your grandmother whether she knew about Peter Pan when she was a girl, she also says, \"Why, of course, I did, child,\" but if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days, she says she never heard of his having a goat. Perhaps she has forgotten, just as she sometimes forgets your name and calls you Mildred, which is your mother's name. Still, she could hardly forget such an important thing as the goat. Therefore there was no goat when your grandmother was a little girl. This shows that, in telling the story of Peter Pan, to begin with the goat (as most people do) is as silly as to put on your jacket before your vest.",

    "description": "Taking its title from a description of Peter Pan's Neverland, <em>Astonishing Splashes of Colour</em> follows the life of Kitty, a woman who, in a sense, has never grown up. As her moods swing dramatically from high to low, they are illuminated by an unusual ability to interpret people and emotions through colour.<br /><br />Kitty struggles to come to terms with her life, including the loss of her mother, a miscarriage, and an unconventional marriage to her husband, who lives in the apartment next door. And when her father and brothers reveal a family secret long hidden, it overwhelms Kitty's tenuous hold on reality and propels her on an impetuous journey to the brink of madness.<br /><br />This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.",

But Frank's behavior is so strange that Kenji begins to entertain a horrible suspicion: that his new client is in fact the serial killer currently terrorizing the city. It isn't until later, however, that Kenji learns exactly how much he has to fear and how irrevocably his encounter with this great white whale of an American will change his life.",

They can now be taken apart and used to make other words. Which is downright dangerous. There's a very real threat of news getting out there. Of people finding out what's really going on. And the powers that be aren't happy - they want that to be far from the truth.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If they are to call a halt to this madness of free speech, they may have to succumb to their despotic tendencies. But will they, in this brave new world, still be able to have the last word?",

    "description": "Anne Michaels\u2019 spellbinding d\u00e9but novel<i> </i>has quickly become one of the most beloved and talked-about books of the decade. As a young boy during the Second World War, Jakob Beer is rescued from the mud in Poland by an unlikely saviour, the scientist Athos Roussos, and he is taken to Greece, then, at war\u2019s end, to Toronto. It is here that his loss gradually surfaces, as does the haunting question of his sister\u2019s fate. Later in life, as a translator and a poet, and now with the glorious Michaela, Jakob meets Ben, a young professor whose own legacies of the war kindle within him a fascination with the older man and his writing. <i>Fugitive Pieces</i> is a work of rare vision that is at once lyrical, sensual, profound. With its vivid evocation of landscape and character, its unique excavation of memory and time, it is a wholly unforgettable novel that draws us into the lives of its characters with compassion and recognition.",

    "description": "On December 26, 1998, 115 sailboats set out on the annual race from Sydney to Hobart; only 43 would make it to the Tasmanian city, the race having turned into the worst modern sailing disaster since the 1979 Fastnet Race. Combining the best elements of The Perfect Storm (W.W. Norton, 1997) and Barbarians at the Gate (HarperCollins, 1990), The Proving Ground is a gripping narrative that follows the fates of three yachts, including Sayonara, owned by Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle. From the chilling explanation of how an Olympic sailor came to be catapulted from a yacht and why its crew could do nothing to save him, to the dramatic journeys of two leaky life-rafts, The Proving Ground is an exhilarating read.",

    "description": "In the winter of 1951, a storyteller arrives at the home of nine-year-old Ronan O'Mara in the Irish countryside. The last practitioner of an honored, centuries-old tradition, the <em>Seanchai</em> enthralls his assembled audience for three evenings running with narratives of foolish kings and fabled saints, of enduring accomplishments and selfless acts -- until he is banished from the household for blasphemy and moves on. But these three incomparable nights have changed young Ronan forever, setting him on the course he will follow for years to come -- as he pursues the elusive, itinerant storyteller . . . and the magical tales that are no less than the glorious saga of his tenacious, troubled, and extraordinary isle.",

    "description": "For centuries, the story of Dracula has captured the imagination of readers and storytellers alike. Kostova's breathtaking first novel, ten years in the writing, is an accomplished retelling of this ancient tale. \"The story that follows is one I never intended to commit to paper.. As an historian, I have learned that, in fact, not everyone who reaches back into history can survive it.\" With these words, a nameless narrator unfolds a story that began 30 years earlier. <br /><br />Late one night in 1972, as a 16-year-old girl, she discovers a mysterious book and a sheaf of letters in her father's library -- a discovery that will have dreadful and far-reaching consequences, and will send her on a journey of mind-boggling danger. While seeking clues to the secrets of her father's past and her mother's puzzling disappearance, she follows a trail from London to Istanbul to Budapest and beyond, and learns that the letters in her possession provide a link to one of the world's darkest and most intoxicating figures. Generation after generation, the legend of Dracula has enticed and eluded both historians and opportunists alike. Now a young girl undertakes the same search that ended in the death and defilement of so many others -- in an attempt to save her father from an unspeakable fate.",

    "description": "<em>I'd wondered about my mother all my life -- what she looked like, how she smelled and sounded and acted. Lately this wondering had grown to encompass a curiosity about the kind of people she herself came from, because they were my family, too, after all, even though I knew nothing about them. I'd no idea whether they were loud or soft-spoken, funny or boring, preferred chocolate to vanilla, if they liked movies over books or the other way around. I wondered whether any of them had ever done anything magnificent in their lives, or if they were the kind of folks who were satisfied with just getting by. These things were important -- knowing them would help me to know myself, and the only way that would happen was if I went and looked for her.</em><br /><br />With all his possessions on his motorcycle, Billy Mann sets off on a cross-country odyssey from New York to Santa Fe in search of a mother who deserted him long ago. What Billy discovers, however, is a life rich with possibility -- the chance for love, friendship, and, finally, a family to call his own.",

By controlling body position and learning how to harmonize important physical and mental abilities, anyone (regardless of size, strength or weight) can fend off attacks using this sophisticated martial art.<br /><br />Written and illustrated by husband/wife team, Oscar Ratti and Adele Westbrook, <i>Aikido and the Dynamic Sphere</i>, with over 1,200 illustrations, includes many Aikido techniques in chapters such as:<br />What is Aikido?<br />The Foundations of Aikido<br />The Practice of Aikido<br />The Basic Techniques of Neutralization<br />Advanced Practice<br />And more!",

    "description": "Like Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm, Isak Dinesen and Angela Carter, A. S. Byatt knows that fairy tales are for grownups. And in this ravishing collection she breathes new life into the form.<br /><br /><b>Little Black Book of Stories</b> offers shivers along with magical thrills. Leaves rustle underfoot in a dark wood:<i> </i>two middle-aged women, childhood friends reunited by chance, venture into a dark forest where once, many years before, they saw\u2013or thought they saw\u2013something unspeakable. Another woman, recently bereaved, finds herself slowly but surely turning into stone. A coolly rational ob-gyn has his world pushed off-axis by a waiflike art student with her own ideas about the uses of the body. Spellbinding, witty, lovely, terrifying, the <b>Little Black Book of Stories</b> is Byatt at the height of her craft.",

    "description": "Sally Goodchild is everything you'd expect of a thirty-seven year old American journalist - independent, strong-willed and ambitious. That is until she meets Tony Hobbs, an English foreign correspondent, on assignment in Cairo. After a passionate but uneasy romance, Sally's life is turned upside down when she unexpectedly finds herself married, pregnant and living in London.<br /><br />Married life in a foreign place is a far bigger adjustment than Sally and Tony could ever have imagined - and as their lives shift from freedom and adventure to responsibility and hard work, everyday problems soon spiral into nightmares. After the birth of their son, Sally finds herself trapped in a downward spiral of post-natal depression over which she has little control, whilst Tony's life returns to relative normality. Filled with resentment and unable to cope with the cards life has dealt her, Sally is shocked when the man she trusted above all others turns against her. As her world begins to fall down around her, Sally quickly realises she must fight before she loses everything.<br /><br />In this authentic and compelling novel, Kennedy explores the misunderstandings that can occur when two people speak the same language but miss all the vital signs.",

    "description": "Taking its autobiographical inspiration from D.H. Lawrence's experience of growing up in a coal-mining town, <i>Sons and Lovers</i> is a vivid account of the conflict between class, family and personal desires. This Penguin Classics edition is edited by Helen Baron and Carl Baron, with an introduction by Blake Morrison, author of <i>When did you Last See your Father?</i><br /><br />The marriage of Gertrude and Walter Morel has become a battleground. Repelled by her uneducated and violent husband, delicate Gertrude devotes her life to her children, especially to her sons, William and Paul - determined they will not follow their father into working down the coal mines. But conflict is evitable when Paul seeks to escape his mother's suffocating grasp through relationships with women his own age. Set in Lawrence's native Nottinghamshire, <i>Sons and Lovers</i> is a highly autobiographical and compelling portrayal of childhood, adolescence and the clash of generations.<br /><br />In his introduction, Blake Morrison discusses the novel's place in Lawrence's life and his depiction of the mother-son relationship, sex and politics. Using the complete and restored text of the Cambridge edition, this volume includes a new chronology and further reading by Paul Poplawski.<br /><br />D.H. Lawrence (1885-1930), English novelist, storywriter, critic, poet and painter, one of the greatest figures in 20th-century English literature. Lawrence published <i>Sons and Lovers </i>in 1913, but <i>The Rainbow</i>, completed in 1915, was declared obscene and banned two months after first publication; and for three years he could not find a publisher for <i>Women in Love</i>, which he completed in 1917. His last novel, <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i>, was published in 1928, but banned in England and America.<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>Sons and Lovers</i>, you might like Lawrence's <i>The Rainbow</i>, also available in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />'Lawrence's masterpiece ... a revelation' <br />Anthony Burgess, author of <i>A Clockwork Orange</i><br /><br />'His genius was for instant perception and vivid, passionate expression'<br /><i>The Times</i>",

    "description": "Sunny Jim Whitelaw, a descendent of pioneers and owner of a large bottling plant, may have died, but he has no intention of relinquishing control: his will specifies that no one gets a cent unless his daughter Evelyn reconciles with her estranged husband, Paul. But Evelyn is a strong-willed woman, fiercely attached to the land, whose horses transport her to a West she feels is disappearing, while Paul is a suave manipulator, without scruples, intent on living well. <br /><br />As played out on the majestic stage of Montana cattle country, the ensuing drama involves blood, money, sex, vengeance, and a cross-dressing rancher. <b>The Cadence of Grass</b> is renewed evidence that McGuane is one of the finest writers we have, capable of simultaneously burnishing and demolishing the mythology of the West while doing rope tricks with the English language.",

Feeding both his pupils and family with facts, he bans fancy and wonder from any young minds. As a consequence his obedient daughter Louisa marries the loveless businessman and 'bully of humanity' Mr Bounderby, and his son Tom rebels to become embroiled in gambling and robbery. And, as their fortunes cross with those of free-spirited circus girl Sissy Jupe and victimized weaver Stephen Blackpool, Gradgrind is eventually forced to recognize the value of the human heart in an age of materialism and machinery.",

    "description": "A stunning and provocative new novel by the internationally celebrated author of \"The Blind Assassin,\" winner of the Booker Prize <br />Margaret Atwood's new novel is so utterly compelling, so prescient, so relevant, so terrifyingly-all-too-likely-to-be-true, that readers may find their view of the world forever changed after reading it. <br />This is Margaret Atwood at the absolute peak of her powers. For readers of \"Oryx and Crake,\" nothing will ever look the same again. <br />The narrator of Atwood's riveting novel calls himself Snowman. When the story opens, he is sleeping in a tree, wearing an old bedsheet, mourning the loss of his beloved Oryx and his best friend Crake, and slowly starving to death. He searches for supplies in a wasteland where insects proliferate and pigoons and wolvogs ravage the pleeblands, where ordinary people once lived, and the Compounds that sheltered the extraordinary. As he tries to piece together what has taken place, the narrative shifts to decades earlier. How did everything fall apart so quickly? Why is he left with nothing but his haunting memories? Alone except for the green-eyed Children of Crake, who think of him as a kind of monster, he explores the answers to these questions in the double journey he takes - into his own past, and back to Crake's high-tech bubble-dome, where the Paradice Project unfolded and the world came to grief. <br />With breathtaking command of her shocking material, and with her customary sharp wit and dark humour, Atwood projects us into an outlandish yet wholly believable realm populated by characters who will continue to inhabit our dreams long after the last chapter. This is Margaret Atwood at the absolute peak of her powers.",

When the subway stops short, she's the one thrown into some stranger's lap. Plus, she's had more than her share of misfortune in the way of love. In fact, after she realizes romantic heroes are a thing of the past, she decides it's time for a fresh start.<br />Setting off for England, Eloise is determined to finish her dissertation on that dashing pair of spies, the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian. But what she discovers is something the finest historians have missed: the secret history of the Pink Carnation - the most elusive spy of all time. As she works to unmask this obscure spy, Eloise stumbles across answers to all kinds of questions. How did the Pink Carnation save England from Napoleon? What became of the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian? And will Eloise Kelly escape her bad luck and find a living, breathing hero all her own?",

            "description": "The Asian Saga is a series of six novels written by James Clavell between 1962 and 1993. The novels all center on Europeans in Asia, and together they explore the impact on East and West of the meeting of these two distinct civilizations.\n    \n    The generally accepted Series order is Chronological, and not by publication date. You will find the numbering on the books reflects the chronological (or reading) order:\n    \n    1. Sh\u014dgun: set in feudal Japan, 1600\n    2. Tai-Pan: set in Hong Kong, 1841\n    3. Gai-Jin: set in Japan, 1862\n    4. King Rat: set in a Japanese POW camp, Singapore, 1945\n    5. Noble House: set in Hong Kong, 1963\n    6. Whirlwind: set in Iran, 1979\n    \n    For the publication order, see: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/71771-asian-saga-publication-order\">Asian Saga: Publication Order </a>\n    \n    After the publication of Whirlwind, Clavell wrote a shorter version of the story which focused on two characters from the book. Entitled Escape: The Love Story from Whirlwind, the book is generally not considered an official part of the Asian Saga and is considered quite rare; nonetheless some reviewers said it helped flesh out several aspects of the original novel.\n    \n    Clavell died in 1994 after the publication of Gai-Jin; it was reported that he was planning several more entries in the Asian Saga series at the time of his death.\n    \n    See the Norwegian language editions here: https://www.goodreads.com/series/216348-asian-saga-norwegian-language-editions",

    "description": "<b>The Children</b> is Halberstam's moving evocation of the early days of the civil rights movement, as seen thru the story of the young people--the Children--who met in the 60s &amp; went on to lead the revolution. Magisterial in scope, with a strong you-are-there quality, <b>The Children</b> is a story one of America's preeminent journalists has waited years to write, a powerful book about one of the most dramatic movements in American history. They came together as part of Rev. James Lawson's workshops on nonviolence, eight idealistic black students whose families had sacrificed much so that they could go to college. They risked it all, &amp; their lives besides, when they joined the growing civil rights movement. Halberstam shows how Martin Luther King Jr recruited Lawson to come to Nashville to train students in Gandhian techniques of nonviolence. We see the strength of the families the Children came from, moving portraits of several generations of the black experience in America. We feel Diane Nash's fear before the first sit-in to protest segregation of Nashville lunch counters. Then we see how Diane Nash &amp; others--John Lewis, Gloria Johnson, Bernard Lafayette, Marion Barry, Curtis Murphy, James Bevel, Rodney Powell--persevered until they ultimately accomplished that goal. After the sit-ins, when the Freedom Rides to desegregate interstate buses were in danger of being stopped because of violence, it was these same young people who led the bitter battle into the Deep South. Halberstam takes us into those buses, lets us witness the violence the students encountered in Montgomery, Birmingham, Selma. He shows what has happened to the Children since the 60s, as they have gone on with their lives. <b>The Children</b> bears the trademark qualities that have made Halberstam one of the leading nonfiction writers of our era. <b>The Children</b> is his most personal book since <b>The Best &amp; the Brightest</b>, a magnificent recreation of a unique period in America, &amp; of the lives of the ordinary people whose courage &amp; vision changed history.",

    "description": "\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is Oscar Wilde's classic tale of the moral decline of its title character, Dorian Gray. When Dorian has his portrait painted by Basil Hallward and wishes that he would stay young while his picture changes, his wish comes true. In exchange for this Dorian gives up his soul and as he ages the bad deeds that he commits are reflected in his painting and not him. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" arguably Wilde's most popular work, was considered quite scandalous when it was first published in the late 1800s in Victorian England.",

Poking fun at his own weaknesses and those of other people (and dogs) - the English teacher who looked only at figures of speech, the Airedale who refused to include him in the family, the botany lecturer who despaired of him totally - James Thurber is essential reading for everyone who loves to laugh.",

    "description": "<i>Fables: 1001 Nights of Snowfall</i> is set in the early days of Fabletown, long before the <i>Fables</i> series began. Traveling to Arabia as an ambassador from the exiled Fables community, Snow White is captured by the local sultan who wants to marry her (and then kill her). But clever Snow attempts to charm the sultan instead by playing Scheherazade, telling him fantastic stories for a total of 1001 nights, saving her very skin in the process.<br /><br />Running the gamut from unexpected horror to dark intrigue to mercurial coming-of-age, <i>Fables: 1001 Nights of Snowfall</i> reveals the secret histories of familiar <i>Fables</i> characters through a series of compelling and visually illustrative tales. Writer Bill Willingham is joined by an impressive array of artists from comic book industry legends to the amazing young painters of the next wave. <br /><br /><i>Fables: 1001 Nights of Snowfall</i> is both a welcome entry point to the critically acclaimed series and an essential part of Willingham's enchanting and imaginative <i>Fables</i> mythos.",

    "description": "Since the last Ice Age, the reindeer's extraordinary adaptation to cold has sustained human life over vast tracts of the earth's surface, providing meat, fur, and transport. Images carved into rocks and tattooed on the skin of mummies hint at ancient ideas about the reindeer's magical ability to carry the human soul on flights to the sun. These images pose one of the great mysteries of prehistory: the \"reindeer revolution,\" in which Siberian native peoples tamed and saddled a species they had previously hunted.<br /><br />Drawing on nearly twenty years of field work among the Eveny in northeast Siberia, Piers Vitebsky shows how Eveny social relations are formed through an intense partnership with these extraordinary animals as they migrate over the swamps, ice sheets, and mountain peaks of what in winter is the coldest inhabited region in the world. He reveals how indigenous ways of knowing involve a symbiotic ecology of mood between humans and reindeer, and he opens up an unprecedented understanding of nomadic movement, place, memory, habit, and innovation.<br /><br />The Soviets' attempts to settle the nomads in villages undermined their self-reliance and mutual support. In an account both harrowing and funny, Vitebsky shows the Eveny's ambivalence toward productivity plans and medals and their subversion of political meetings designed to control them. The narrative gives a detailed and tender picture of how reindeer can act out or transform a person's destiny and of how prophetic dreaming about reindeer fills a gap left by the failed assurances of the state.<br /><br />Vitebsky explores the Eveny experience of the cruelty of history through the unfolding and intertwining of their personal lives. The interplay of domestic life and power politics is both intimate and epic, as the reader follows the diverging fate of three charismatic but very different herding families through dangerous political and economic reforms. The book's gallery of unforgettable personalities includes shamans, psychics, wolves, bears, dogs, Communist Party bosses, daredevil aviators, fire and river spirits, and buried ancestors. The Reindeer People is a vivid and moving testimony to a Siberian native people's endurance and humor at the ecological limits of human existence.",

    "description": "Awarded the American-Scandinavian PEN Translation Prize by Michael Hamburger, Susanna Nied's translation of <em>alphabet</em> introduces Inger Christensen's poetry to US readers for the first time. Born in 1935, Inger Christensen is Denmark's best known poet. Her award-winning <em>alphabet</em> is based structurally on Fibonacci's sequence (a mathematical sequence in which each number is the sum of the two previous numbers), in combination with the alphabet. The gorgeous poetry herein reflects a complex philosophical background, yet has a visionary quality, discovering the metaphysical in the simple stuff of everyday life. In <em>alphabet</em>, Christensen creates a framework of psalm-like forms that unfold like expanding universes, while crystallizing both the beauty and the potential for destruction that permeate our times.",

    "description": "In 1836, the murder of a young prostitute made headlines in New York City and around the country, inaugurating a sex-and-death sensationalism in news reporting that haunts us today. Patricia Cline Cohen goes behind these first lurid accounts to reconstruct the story of the mysterious victim, Helen Jewett. <br /><br />From her beginnings as a servant girl in Maine, Helen Jewett refashioned herself, using four successive aliases, into a highly paid courtesan. She invented life stories for herself that helped her build a sympathetic clientele among New York City's elite, and she further captivated her customers through her seductive letters, which mixed elements of traditional feminine demureness with sexual boldness.<br /><br />But she was to meet her match--and her nemesis--in a youth called Richard Robinson. He was one of an unprecedented number of young men who flooded into America's burgeoning cities in the 1830s to satisfy the new business society's seemingly infinite need for clerks. The son of an established Connecticut family, he was intense, arrogant, and given to posturing. He became Helen Jewett's lover in a tempestuous affair and ten months later was arrested for her murder. He stood trial in a five-day courtroom drama that ended with his acquittal amid the cheers of hundreds of fellow clerks and other spectators.<br /><br />With no conviction for murder, nor closure of any sort, the case continued to tantalize the public, even though Richard Robinson disappeared from view. Through the Erie Canal, down the Ohio and the Mississippi, and by way of New Orleans, he reached the wilds of Texas and a new life under a new name. Through her meticulous and ingenious research, Patricia Cline Cohen traces his life there and the many twists and turns of the lingering mystery of the murder. Her stunning portrayals of Helen Jewett, Robinson, and their raffish, colorful nineteenth-century world make vivid a frenetic city life and sexual morality whose complexities, contradictions, and concerns resonate with those of our own time.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

Immersing herself in the heady rhythms of a city that is like something wild, caged, and pacing, Laurel tries to lose herself. But when she runs away from the past, she discovers a passion so powerful, it brings her roundabout and face-to-face with the demons she wants to avoid.In a stunning departure from her enormously popular Weetzie Bat books, Francesca Lia Block weaves a darkly exhilarating tale of shattered passions and family secrets.",

The magical business is run by two families - the Montanas and the Petrocchis - and they are deadly rivals. So when all the spells start going wrong, they naturally blame each other.<br /><br /><br />Chrestomanci suspects an evil enchanter; others say it is a White Devil. Or maybe a different kind of magic is needed to save Caprona\u2026",

    "description": "<i>A Power Governments Cannot Suppress</i> is a major new collection of essays on American history, class, immigration, justice, and ordinary citizens who have made a difference. Zinn addresses America's current political/ethical crisis using lessons learned from our nation\u2019s history. Zinn brings a profoundly human, yet uniquely American perspective to each subject he writes about, whether it\u2019s the abolition of war, terrorism, the Founding Fathers, the Holocaust, defending the rights of immigrants, or personal liberties. Written in an accessible, personal tone, Zinn approaches the telling of U.S. history from an active, engaged point of view. \"America's future is linked to how we understand our past,\u201d writes Zinn; \"For this reason, writing about history, for me, is never a neutral act.\"<br /><br />Zinn frames the book with an opening essay titled \"If History is to be Creative,\" a reflection on the role and responsibility of the historian. \"To think that history-writing must aim simply to recapitulate the failures that dominate the past,\" writes Zinn, \"is to make historians collaborators in an endless cycle of defeat.\" \"If history is to be creative, to anticipate a possible future without denying the past, it should, I believe, emphasize new possibilities by disclosing those hidden episodes of the past when, even if in brief flashes, people showed their ability to resist, to join together, and occasionally win. I am supposing, or perhaps only hoping, that our future may be found in the past\u2019s fugitive moments of compassion rather than in its solid centuries of warfare.\"<br /><br />Buzzing with stories and ideas, Zinn draws upon fascinating, little-known historical anecdotes spanning from the Declaration of Independence to the USA PATRIOT Act to comment on the most controversial issues facing us today: government dishonesty, how to respond to terrorism, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the loss of our liberties, immigration, and the responsibility of the citizen to confront power for the common good.<br /><br />Considered a \"modern-day Thoreau\" by Jonathon Kozol, Zinn's inspired writings address the reader as an active participant in history making. \"We live in a beautiful country,\u201d writes Zinn, in the book\u2019s opening chapter. \u201cBut people who have no respect for human life, freedom, or justice have taken it over. It is now up to all of us to take it back.\"<br /><br />Featuring essays penned over an eight-year period, A Power Governments Cannot Suppress is Howard Zinn\u2019s first writerly work in several years, an invaluable post-9/11-era addition to the themes that run through his bestselling classic, A People\u2019s History Of the United States.<br /><br />Howard Zinn is a veteran of World War II and author of many books and plays, including the million-selling classic, A People\u2019s History of the United States. <br /><br />\"Thank you, Howard Zinn. Thank you for telling us what none of our leaders are willing to: The truth. And you tell it with such brilliance, such humanity. It is a personal honor to be able to say I am a better citizen because of you.\"--Michael Moore, director of the film Fahrenheit 9/11, and author of the New York Times bestseller, Stupid White Men ...and Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation!<br /><br />\"Find here the voice of the well-educated and honorable and capable and human United States of America, which might have existed if only absolute power had not corrupted its third-rate leaders so absolutely.\"-- Kurt Vonnegut, author of A Man Without a Country",

So too was his sister Sara -- an independent, canny young woman, starting to make her way in the big city. And then in walked a gatecrasher, Jack Malone -- a U. S. Army journalist just back from a defeated Germany, and a man whose world-view did not tally with that of Eric and his friends. Set amidst the dynamic optimism of postwar New York and the subsequent nightmare of the McCarthy witch-hunts, <b>The Pursuit of Happiness</b> is a great tragic love story; a tale of divided loyalties, decisive moral choices, and the random workings of destiny.",

Hoteliers, pet-bear owners, friends of Freud (the animal trainer and vaudevillian, that is), and playthings of mad fate, they 'dream on' in this funny, sad, outrageous, and moving novel.",

    "description": "The return of a beloved classic, from the bestselling author of <i>The Princess Bride</i>!<br /><br />Once upon a time, the gondoliers of Venice possessed the finest voices in all the world. But, alas, few remember those days--and fewer still were ever blessed to hear such glorious singing. No one since has discovered the secret behind the sudden silence of the golden-voiced gondoliers. No one, it seems, but S. Morgenstern. Now Morgenstern recounts the sad and noble story of the ambitions, frustrations, and eventual triumph of Luigi, the gondolier with the goony smile.<br /><br />Here, in this brilliantly illustrated exposition of the surprising facts behind this all-but-forgotten mystery, S. Morgenstern reveals the fascinating truths about John the Bastard, Laura Lorenzini, the centenarian Cristaldi the Pickle, Enrico Caruso, Porky XII, the Great Sorrento, the Queen of Corsica--and of course, the one and only Luigi. His tale will captivate you as much as his song!",

    "description": "<i>On Subbing</i> is a quiet classic. It's impossible to put down, or forget, Dave Roche's vivid, self-deprecating, tales of woe from working as a substitute teaching assistant in Portland's elementary schools in the early 2000s. He writes about the good days and the terrible ones, helping kids who can't function in normal classrooms focus on their work, keeping kids from fighting, and keeping his composure while they tease him or adorably flirt with him. It's a real heartwarming ticket to putting a smile on your face and turning your day around. Illustrations from Clutch McBastard, Nicole Georges, Keith Rosson, Nate Beaty, Shawn Granton, and Aaron Renier.<br />",

    "description": "In Japan, Kenji Kawakami is famous for his tireless promotion of Chindogu: the art of the unuseless idea. Kawakami has developed an entire philosophy around these bizarre and logic-defying gadgets and gizmos, which must work but are actually entirely impractical. Created in the spirit of anarchy, unuseless inventions are not allowed to be patented or sold.<br /><br /><br />Fans of the unuseless will love this completely absorbing collection of 200 Chindogu, including:<br /><br /><br /><br />the Drymobile (your laundry dries as you drive)<br />the Solar-Powered Torch (never runs low on batteries)<br />Duster Slippers for Cats (now the most boring job around the house becomes hours of fun\u2014for your cat!)<br />Walk 'n' Wash Ankle-Attachable Laundry Tanks (a perfect solution for the problems of inadequate exercise and hygiene)<br />and many, many more.<br />These hilarious inventions have taken Japan by storm. Every one of the 200 items in <em>The Big Bento Box of Unuseless Japanese Inventions</em> has actually been manufactured to the highest standards, fully tested by pioneering members of the Japanese public, and documented in their unuselessness with photographs.",

    "description": "An important and often-quoted literary figure, the English poet Christina Rossetti (1830\u20131894) wrote some of the most beautiful and voluptuous poetry in the English language. Like Emily Dickinson, she lived in self-imposed isolation, writing of God and lost love with a sensuality and passion that seemed to emanate from the soul.<br />This edition of 53 works combines a number of her best-known sonnets, ballads, and shorter lyrics with her long masterpiece, the narrative fable <i>Goblin Market</i>. A haunting fairy tale in verse, <i>Goblin Market</i> was once labeled a children's poem, yet its intricate symbolism and themes of temptation, sin, and redemption mark it for an adult audience. Among other works included in this choice collection are \"The Convent Threshold,\" \"Up-hill,\" \"Cousin Kate,\" \"Winter: My Secret,\" \"Maude Clare,\" \"No, Thank You, John,\" and \"After Death.\"<br />",

    "description": "The story of 'Islands in the Sky' centers around a young man, who, after brilliantly winning a space-related competition, requests a vacation on a space station as his prize. It is written with Arthur C. Clarke's obvious knowledge of science, but moves at a page turning rate througout the entire narrative. The short novel gives a realistic possiblilty of work and play in future space, hightened with constant excitment and action.",

    "description": "The old opposition of matter versus mind stubbornly persists in the way we study mind and brain. In treating cognition as problem solving, Andy Clark suggests, we may often abstract too far from the very body and world in which our brains evolved to guide us. Whereas the mental has been treated as a realm that is distinct from the body and the world, Clark forcefully attests that a key to understanding brains is to see them as controllers of embodied activity. From this paradigm shift he advances the construction of a cognitive science of the embodied mind.",

    "description": "<p><i>Mindware</i> is an introductory text with a difference. In eight short chapters it tells a story and invites the reader to join in some up-to-the-minute conceptual discussion of the key issues, problems, and opportunities in cognitive science. The story is about the search for a cognitive scientific understanding of mind. It is presented as a no-holds-barred journey from early work in Artificial Intelligence, through connectionist (artificial neural network) counter-visions, and onto neuroscience artificial life, dynamics and robotics. The journey ends with some wide-ranging and provacative speculation about the role of technology and the changing nature of the human mind itself.<br />Each chapter is organized as an initial sketch of a research program or theme, followed by a substantial discussion section in which specific problems and issues (both familiear and cutting-edge) are raised and pursued. Discussion topics include mental causation, the hardware/software distinction, the relations between life and mind, the nature of perception, cognition and action, and the continuity (or otherwise) of high-level human intelligence with other forms of adaptive response. Classic topics are treated alongside the newer ones in an integrated treatment of the various discussions. The sketches and discussions are accompanied by numerous figures and boxed sections, and followed by suggestions for futher reading.</p>",

    "description": "<i>'If it were I who were to always young and the picture to grow old \u2026 I would give my soul for it.'</i><br /><br />The wish uttered by Dorain Gray as he gazes on his portrait forms the basis of this brialliant and disturbing story of a gilded and spoilt hedonist who, Faust-like, is willing to sell his soul for his beauty.<br /><br />First oublished to scandalised protest in 1890, Oscar Wilde's fantastic melodrama was widely condemned by his contemporaries as ana ffront to the values of polite society. It has since become one of his most celebrated works, a brilliant example of his power as a storyteller and of his flamboyant wit and aestheticism.",

    "description": "Although the Cleves generally revelled in every detail of their family history, the events of 'the terrible Mother's Day' were never, ever discussed. On that day, nine-year-old Robin Cleves, loved by all for his whims and peculiarities, was found hanging by the neck from a rope slung over a black-tupelo tree in his own garden. no nearer a solution than it had been on the day it happened. This isn't good enough for Robin's youngest sister Harriet. Only a baby when the tragedy occurred, but now twelve-years-old and steeped in the adventurous daring of favourite writers such as Stevenson, Kipling and Conan Doyle, Harriet is ready and eager to find and punish her brother's killer. Her closest friend Hely - who would try anything to make Harriet love him - has sworn allegiance to her call for revenge. But the world these plucky twelve-year-olds are to encounter has nothing to do with child's play: it is dark, adult and all too menacing. In Donna Tartt's Mississippi, the sense of place and sense of the past mingle redolently with rich human drama to create a collective alchemy. a child's inquiring mind not only unearths telling family artefacts, but stirs up a neighbourhood nest of vipers and larceny. The Little Friend is a profoundly involving novel which demonstrates how the imaginary life embraces what literature we read, what special places we inhabit and what kindred souls we recognize, to help crack open even the darkest secrets life has hiding for us.",

He's made a lot of mistakes that have paid off and a lot of smart moves he'll regret forever (however long that turns out to be). Daniel Weir has gone from rags to riches and back, and managed to hold onto them both, though not much else. His friends all seem to be dead, fed up with him or just disgusted - and who can blame them? And now Daniel Weir is all alone. As he contemplates his life, Daniel realises he only has two problems: the past and the future. He knows how bad the past has been. But the future - well, the future is something else.",

    "description": "From the amazing success of the documentary March of the Penguins to the popular penguins in Madagascar to this fall\u2019s upcoming penguin-themed movie Happy Feet, penguins are everywhere! That\u2019s especially true for the family in 365 Penguins, who find a penguin mysteriously delivered to their door every day for a year. At first they\u2019re cute, but with every passing day, the penguins pile up\u2014along with the family\u2019s problems. Feeding, cleaning, and housing the penguins becomes a monumental task. They\u2019re noisy and smelly, and they always hog the bathroom! And who on earth is sending these kwaking critters? In a large format, and with lots of opportunity for counting, 365 Penguins is sure to become a perennial wintertime favorite.",

He was living alone, a quiet life on a shady street in Brazil; a simple life in a modest home, certainly not one of luxury. Certainly no evidence of the fortune they thought he had stolen. He was much thinner and his face had been altered. He spoke a different language, and spoke it very well.<br /><br />But Danilo had a past with many chapters. Four years earlier he had been Patrick Lanigan, a young partner in a prominent Biloxi law firm. He had a pretty wife, a new daughter, and a bright future. Then one cold winter night Patrick was trapped in a burning car and died a horrible death. When he was buried his casket held nothing more than his ashes.<br /><br />From a short distance away, Patrick watched his own burial. Then he fled. Six weeks later, a fortune was stolen from his ex-law firm's offshore account. And Patrick fled some more.<br /><br />But they found him.",

Now he is risking it all for a death-row killer and an impossible case.<br /><br />Maximum Security Unit, Mississippi State Prison:<br /><br />Sam Cayhall is a former Klansman and unrepentant racist now facing the death penalty for a fatal bombing in 1967.

For between the two men is a chasm of shame, family lies, and secrets -- including the one secret that could save Sam Cayhall's life... or cost Adam his.<br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

Unbeknownst to D'Artagnan, Aramis and Porthos plot to remove the inept king and place the king's twin brother on the throne of France. Meanwhile, a twenty-three-year-old prisoner known only as \"Philippe\" wastes away deep inside the Bastille. Forced to wear an iron mask, Phillippe has been imprisoned for eight years, has no knowledge of his true identity, and has not been told what crime he's committed. When the destinies of the king and Phillippe converge, the Three Musketeers and D'Artagnan find themselves caught between conflicting loyalties.",

In \"Excession\", the Culture's espionage and dirty tricks section orders Diplomat Byr Gen-Hofoen to steal the soul of a long-dead starship captain. By accepting the mission, Byr irrevocably plunges himself into a conspiracy: one that could either lead the universe into an age of peace or to the brink of annihilation.",

    "description": "<b>Purpose Driven Romance</b><br /><br />The last thing singles want is more rules. But if you're looking for an intentional, God-pleasing game plan for finding a future spouse, Joshua Harris delivers an appealing one. A compelling new foreword, an all-new \"8 Great Courtship Conversations\" section, and updated material throughout makes this five-year revision of the original <i>Boy Meets Girl</i> a must-have! Harris illustrates how biblical courtship--a healthy, joyous alternative to recreational dating--worked for him and his wife. <i>Boy Meets Girl</i> presents an inspiring, practical example for readers wanting to pursue the possibility of marriage with someone they may be serious about.<br /><br /><b>Are you ready for \"romance with purpose\"? </b><br /><br />If you're fed up with self-centered relationships that end in disillusionment, it's time to rethink romance. Finding the loving, committed relationship you want shouldn't mean throwing away your hopes, your integrity, or your heart.<br /><br />In <i>Boy Meets Girl</i>, Joshua Harris --the guy who kissed dating goodbye--makes the case for courtship. As old-fashioned as it might sound, courtship is what modern day relationships desperately need. Think of it as romance chaperoned by wisdom, cared for by community, and directed by God's Word.<br /><br />Filled with inspiring stories from men and women who have rediscovered courtship, <i>Boy Meets Girl</i> is honest, romantic, and refreshingly biblical. Keep God at the center of your relationship as you discover how to:<br /><br />- Set a clear course for your romance <br /> - Get closer without compromise <br /> - Find support in a caring community <br /> - Deal with past sexual sin <br /> - Make the right decisions about your future <br /><b><br />New! Courtship Conversations </b><br />Eight ideas for great dates that will help grow and guide your relationship.<br /><br /><b>Story Behind the Book</b><br /><br />\"I wrote I Kissed Dating Goodbye to challenge singles to drop the worldly approach to serial dating and reconsider the way they pursued romance in light of God's Word. Since then, I've received letters asking questions like, So, what comes between friendship and marriage? and, How can you know when you are ready for marriage? Boy Meets Girl answers those questions. Now as a happily married man I can look back on my courtship with Shannon and see from personal experience that God is faithful. If you trust Him enough to wait on romance in dating, He will lovingly guide you as you pursue it in courtship...right to that wonderful moment when you kneel together at the altar.\" -- Joshua Harris",

There exists a secret band of brothers like no other-six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. Yet none of them relishes killing more than Wrath, the leader of The Black Dagger Brotherhood.<br /><br />The only purebred vampire left on earth, Wrath has a score to settle with the slayers who murdered his parents centuries ago. But, when one of his most trusted fighters is killed-leaving his half-breed daughter unaware of his existence or her fate-Wrath must usher her into the world of the undead-a world of sensuality beyond her wildest dreams.",

Eighteen- to sixty-year-olds will welcome the timely, biblically based approach Dr. Raunikar offers as he encourages them along the path to <i>Choosing God's Best: </i>healing from the past; learning how to avoid the pain of \"counterfeit oneness\" physically, emotionally, and spiritually; and much more. This attractive, repackaged edition delves into the real issues Christian singles face today and offers sound, proven advice for creating deeply satisfying godly relationships.<br /><br /><b>Who's Your Matchmaker?</b><br /><br />Disillusioned by dating? Tired of being let down? It may be time to visit the<i> </i>ultimate Matchmaker.<br /><br />No matter what your age or past, it's never too late to trust God and choose His best for your future. Dr. Don Raunikar delves into the real issues to offer proven, biblical principles for creating godly relationships and a deeply satisfying courtship. Read this book--and be ready for romance God's way.<br /><br /><br /><br />\"Dr. Don Raunikar offers hope for the single man or woman who is disillusioned with the modern dating scene. Drawing upon time-tested biblical principles, Dr. Raunikar makes a convincing case for the benefits of a courtship based on God's wisdom, versus a dating relationship based on man's.\"<br /><br />Bill Bright<br /><br />Founder, Campus Crusade for Christ International<br /><br />\"I feel like <i>Choosing God's Best</i> was written specifically for me. Few would argue that the current system of dating isn't in desperate need of reform. Dr. Raunikar goes even further with his radical, biblical solution to the perils and pitfalls of dating. Thanks, Dr. Raunikar, for being a radical.\"<br /><br />Derek Webb<br /><br />Singer/songwriter<br /><br />\"I'm so glad to see a book addressing what I've called the 'dating mess.' <i>Choosing God's</i> <i>Best</i> is straightforward and scriptural. I especially appreciated the explanation of the categories of dating, which are seldom understood.\"<br /><br />Elisabeth Elliot<br /><br />Author and speaker<br /><br />\"I wish this book had been around when I was dating. So much pain, so many missed opportunities, and so many mistakes could have been avoided if I had used these principles.\"<br /><br />Steve Arterburn<br /><br />Founder and chairman, New Life Ministries<br /><br /><b>Story Behind the Book</b><br /><br />Dr. Don Raunikar was a professional therapist specializing in singles' issues. He wrote <i>Choosing God's Best </i>as a result of discovering the common frustrations and desires of his patients, combined with his own experiences before he was married. Originally published in 1998, the book continues to serve as a timeless message for singles. Still changing lives to this day, this repackaged edition will reach an even broader, untapped market with the hope of God's truth and His promise for healthy relationships.",

The next day America learns\u00a0that two of its Supreme Court justices have been\u00a0assassinated. And in New Orleans, a young law\u00a0student prepares a legal brief... To Darby Shaw it was\u00a0no more than a legal shot in the dark, a brilliant\u00a0guess. To the Washington establishment it was\u00a0political dynamite. Suddenly Darby is witness to a\u00a0murder -- a murder intended for her. Going\u00a0underground, she finds there is only one person she can\u00a0trust -- an ambitious reporter after a newsbreak\u00a0hotter than Watergate -- to help her piece together the\u00a0deadly puzzle. Somewhere between the bayous of\u00a0\u00a0Louisiana and the White House's inner sanctums, a\u00a0violent cover-up is being engineered. For someone has\u00a0read Darby's brief. Someone who will stop at\u00a0nothing to destroy the evidence of an unthinkable\u00a0crime.",

In this searing courtroom drama, best-selling author John Grisham probes the savage depths of racial violence...as he delivers a compelling tale of uncertain justice in a small southern town...Clanton, Mississippi. <br /><br />The life of a ten-year-old girl is shattered by two drunken and remorseless young men. The mostly white town reacts with shock and horror at the inhuman crime. Until her black father acquires an assault rifle and takes matters into his hands.<br /><br />For ten days, as burning crosses and the crack of sniper fire spread through the streets of Clanton, the nation sits spellbound as young defense attorney Jake Brigance struggles to save his client's life...and then his own.",

To reveal them would be to sentence herself to the horror of \"rehabilitation\" - the complete psychic erasure of everything she ever was...<br /><br />Both human and animal, Lucas Hunter is a changeling hungry for the very sensations the Psy disdain. After centuries of uneasy coexistence, these two races are now on the verge of war over the brutal murders of several changeling women. Lucas is determined to find the Psy killer who butchered his packmate, and Sascha is his ticket into their closely guarded society. But he soon discovers that this ice-cold Psy is very capable of passion - and that the animal in him is fascinated by her. Caught between their conflicting worlds, Lucas and Sascha must remain bound to their identities - or sacrifice everything for a taste of darkest temptation.",

The icy and emotionless Psy are under the control of a powerful council of seven beings with very different goals.

    "description": "In 1956, five young men, including Elliot's husband, Jim, traveled into the jungles of Ecuador to establish communication with the fierce Huaorani Tribe, a people whose only previous response to the outside world has been to attack all strangers. The men's mission combined modern technology with innate ingenuity, sparked by a passionate determination to get the gospel to those without Christ. In a nearby village, their wives waited to hear from them. The news they received - all five missionaries had been murdered - changed lives around the world forever. Written while she was still a missionary in South America and at the request of the men's families, Through Gates of Splendor was Elisabeth Elliot's personal account of the final mission of these five courageous men. Filled with quotations from letters, material from personal journals, a wealth of photographs, and an epilogue update, this reprint of the original hardcover edition tells a lasting story of God's grace, unconditional love, and great courage. This story inspired the 2006 box office hit End of the Spear and is sure to inspire the next generation of servant believers.",

    "description": "<b>\n  <i>'I had made myself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a man devised'</i>\n</b><br /><br />When a Victorian scientist propels himself in the year 802,701 AD, he is initially delighted to find that suffering has been replaced by beauty, contentment and peace. Entranced at first by the Eloi, an elfin species descended from man, he soon realises that this beautiful people are simply remnants of a once-great culture - now weak and childishly afraid of the dark. They have every reason to be afraid: in deep tunnels beneath their paradise lurks another race descended from humanity - the sinister Morlocks. And when the scientist's time machine vanishes, it becomes clear he must search these tunnels if he is ever to return to his own era.<br /><br /><i>The Time Machine</i> is the first and greatest modern portrayal of time travel. Part of a brand-new Penguin series of H.G. Wells' works, this edition includes a newly established text, a full biographical essay on Wells, a further reading list and detailed notes. Marina Warner's introduction considers Wells' development of the 'scientific romance' and places the novel in the context of its times.",

But Lack is a nullity with taste\u2014tastes; it absorbs a pomegranate, light bulbs, an argyle sock; it disdains a bow tie, an ice ax, and a scrambled duck egg. To Alice, this selectivity translates as an irresistible personality.

Though the torture and abuse that killed him were real, Andy Gage's death wasn't. Only his soul actually died, and when it died, it broke in pieces. Then the pieces became souls in their own right, coinheritors of Andy Gage's life. . . .<br /><br />While Andy deals with the outside world, more than a hundred other souls share an imaginary house inside Andy's head, struggling to maintain an orderly coexistence: Aaron, the father figure; Adam, the mischievous teenager; Jake, the frightened little boy; Aunt Sam, the artist; Seferis, the defender; and Gideon, who wants to get rid of Andy and the others and run things on his own.<br /><br />Andy's new coworker, Penny Driver, is also a multiple personality, a fact that Penny is only partially aware of. When several of Penny's other souls ask Andy for help, Andy reluctantly agrees, setting in motion a chain of events that threatens to destroy the stability of the house. Now Andy and Penny must work together to uncover a terrible secret that Andy has been keeping . . . from himself.",

She'll be (almost) losing her virginity to a high school dropout, accompanied by the Beastie Boys' \"No Sleep Till Brooklyn.\" She'll be looking for her artistic soul while trying to solve the mysteries of guys, life, her seriously dysfunctional family . . . and herself.In eight chapters, Polly is shaped by eight relationships in this honest, tender, original, and utterly endearing story of one girl's stumbles and successes in the world of punked-out 1980s suburban romance -- the unforgettable debut of an extraordinary new voice in contemporary fiction.",

Editor Daniel Jones has arranged these tales to capture the ebb and flow of relationships, from seeking love and tying the knot to having children and finding love that endures. (Cynics and melancholics can skip right to the section on splitting up.) Taken together, these essays show through a modern lens how love drives, haunts, and enriches us. <br /><br />For anyone who\u2019s loved, lost, stalked an ex, or made a lasting connection, and for the voyeur in all of us, <b>Modern Love</b> is the perfect match.",

As rumours of a legendary hound said to haunt the Baskerville family circulate, Holmes and Watson are asked to ensure the protection of Sir Charles' only heir, Sir Henry - who has travelled all the way from America to reside at Baskerville Hall in Devon. And it is there, in an isolated mansion surrounded by mile after mile of wild moor, that Holmes and Watson come face to face with a terrifying evil that reaches out from centuries past . . .",

Holmes, master of disguise, reasoned logically to deduce clients' background from their first appearance. He used fingerprints, chemical analysis, and forensic science.\n    \n    The majority of the stories were first published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>  accumulated to four novels and fifty-six short stories set 1880-1914.\n    \n    All but four stories are narrated by Holmes's friend and biographer, Dr John H. Watson; two are narrated by Holmes himself (<i>The Blanched Soldier</i> and <i>The Lion's Mane</i>) and two others are written in the third person (<i>The Mazarin Stone</i> and <i>His Last Bow</i>). In two stories (<i>The Musgrave Ritual</i> and <i>The Gloria Scott</i>), Holmes tells Watson the main story from his memories, while Watson becomes the narrator of the frame story. The first and fourth novels, <i>A Study in Scarlet</i> and <i>The Valley of Fear</i>, each include long omniscient narration of events unknown to Holmes or Watson.",

    "description": "For the intrepid traveler, there are more resources than ever before. But what about the traveler who is at a crossroads in life, longing for something else, neither diversion nor distraction, beyond escape and mere entertainment? What about those eager for a journey that is personally meaningful? For millennia this cry has been answered by pilgrimage, the transformative journey to a sacred center. The ancients referred to this path as the Way of the Pilgrim, an acknowledgement of travel for the sake of devotion, commitment, even penance to a holy site, a destination that blazes with meaning -- in short, a journey of risk and renewal. \"The Art of Pilgrimage\" is a guide for travelers ready to embark on a sacred journey and for armchair travelers curious to know what it means to travel with soulful purpose. Geared toward the modern-day pilgrim looking for inspiration and a few spiritual tools for the road, it combines stories, myths, parables, and quotes from famous travelers of the past with practical suggestions and contemporary accounts from people traveling the sacred way today. Not a guidebook to holy sites, this book is designed to help travelers focus on the purpose and intention at every satge of their journey no matter where they are going. \"The Art of Pilgrimage\" includes stories of traditional pilgrimages such as those to Canterbury or Jerusalem, but also ones to Shakespeare's home, Graceland, or the \"Field of Dreams\" in Iowa. Phil Cousineau recounts anecdotes from his own travels covering over 50 countries and offers readers the advice he gives when leading tours for the Joseph Campbell Foundation.",

          "description": "Bunnicula is a children's book series written by James Howe (and his late wife Deborah in the case of the first book, \"Bunnicula\") about a vampire bunny that sucks the juice out of vegetables. \n    \n    The story is centered on the Monroe family and their pets and is told from the perspective of their dog Harold. The Monroes find a bunny at the theater where they were watching a Dracula film. Because of this, they name him Bunnicula. Their cat Chester, however, is convinced Bunnicula is a vampire and attempts to get Harold to help save the Monroes from the perceived menace.\n    \n    Following the end of the Bunnicula series, James Howe began a spin-off series called <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/42323-tales-from-the-house-of-bunnicula\">Tales from the House of Bunnicula</a>, which are 'written' by Howie, the dachshund puppy introduced into the series in Howliday Inn. There is also a series called <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/42743-bunnicula-and-friends\">Bunnicula and Friends</a>. They are a series of picture books about adventures of the characters from the stories. They are aimed for beginning readers.  There's also another series, <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/41910-harold-chester\">Harold & Chester</a>, that are similar to the picture books, but are slightly longer.",

    "description": "Life at the end of the twentieth century presents us with a disturbing reality. Otherness, the simple fact of being different in some way, has come to be defined as in and of itself evil. Miroslav Volf contends that if the healing word of the gospel is to be heard today, Christian theology must find ways of speaking that address the hatred of the other. Reaching back to the New Testament metaphor of salvation as reconciliation, Volf proposes the idea of embrace as a theological response to the problem of exclusion.<br /><br />Increasingly we see that exclusion has become the primary sin, skewing our perceptions of reality and causing us to react out of fear and anger to all those who are not within our (ever-narrowing) circle. In light of this, Christians must learn that salvation comes, not only as we are reconciled to God, and not only as we \"learn to live with one another,\" but as we take the dangerous and costly step of opening ourselves to the other, of enfolding him or her in the same embrace with which we have been enfolded by God.<br /><br />Is there any hope of embracing our enemies? Of opening the door to reconciliation? Miroslav Volf, a Yale University theologian, has won the 2002 Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Religion for his book, Exclusion &amp; Embrace: A Theological Exploration of Identity, Otherness, and Reconciliation (Abingdon, 1996). Volf argues that exclusion of people who are alien or different is among the most intractable problems in the world today. He writes, It may not be too much to claim that the future of our world will depend on how we deal with identity and difference. The issue is urgent. The ghettos and battlefields throughout the world in the living rooms, in inner cities, or on the mountain ranges testify indisputably to its importance. A Croatian by birth, Volf takes as a starting point for his analysis the recent civil war and ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, but he readily finds other examples of cultural, ethnic, and racial conflict to illustrate his points. And, since September 11, one can scarcely help but plug the new world players into his incisive descriptions of the dynamics of interethnic and international strife.<br /><br />Exclusion happens, Volf argues, wherever impenetrable barriers are set up that prevent a creative encounter with the other. It is easy to assume that exclusion is the problem or practice of barbarians who live over there, but Volf persuades us that exclusion is all too often our practice here as well. Modern western societies, including American society, typically recite their histories as narratives of inclusion, and Volf celebrates the truth in these narratives. But he points out that these narratives conveniently omit certain groups who disturb the integrity of their happy ending plots. Therefore such narratives of inclusion invite long and gruesome counter-narratives of exclusion the brutal histories of slavery and of the decimation of Native American populations come readily to mind, but more current examples could also be found.<br /><br />Most proposed solutions to the problem of exclusion have focused on social arrangements what kind of society ought we to create in order to accommodate individual or communal difference? Volf focuses, rather, on what kind of selves we need to be in order to live in harmony with others. In addressing the topic, Volf stresses the social implications of divine self-giving. The Christian scriptures attest that God does not abandon the godless to their evil, but gives of Godself to bring them into communion. We are called to do likewise whoever our enemies and whoever we may be. The divine mandate to embrace as God has embraced is summarized in Paul\u2019s injunction to the Romans: Welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you (Romans 15:7).<br /><br />Susan R. Garrett, Coordinator of the Religion Award, said that the Grawemeyer selection committee praised Volf s book on many counts. These included its profound interpretation of certain pivotal passages of Scripture and its brilliant engagement with contemporary theology, philosophy, critical theory, and feminist theory. Volf s focus is not on social strategies or programs but, rather, on showing us new ways to understand ourselves and our relation to our enemies. He helps us to imagine new possibilities for living against violence, injustice, and deception. Garrett added that, although addressed primarily to Christians, Volf's theological statement opens itself to religious pluralism by upholding the importance of different religious and cultural traditions for the formation of personal and group identity. The call to embrace the other is never a call to remake the other into one s own image. Volf who had just delivered a lecture on the topic of Exclusion and Embrace at a prayer breakfast for the United Nations when the first hijacked plane hit the World Trade Center will present a lecture and receive his award in Louisville during the first week of April, 2002.<br /><br />The annual Religion Award, which includes a cash prize of $200,000, is given jointly by Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary and the University of Louisville to the authors or originators of creative works that contribute significantly to an understanding of the relationship between human beings and the divine, and ways in which this relationship may inspire or empower human beings to attain wholeness, integrity, or meaning, either individually or in community. The Grawemeyer awards given also by the University of Louisville in the fields of musical composition, education, psychology, and world order honor the virtue of accessibility: works chosen for the awards must be comprehensible to thinking persons who are not specialists in the various fields.\"",

    "description": "A comic masterpiece that has never been out of print since it was first published in 1889, Jerome K. Jerome's <i>Three Men in a Boat</i> includes an introduction and notes by Jeremy Lewis in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />Martyrs to hypochondria and general seediness, J. and his friends George and Harris decide that a jaunt up the Thames would suit them to a 'T'. But when they set off, they can hardly predict the troubles that lie ahead with tow-ropes, unreliable weather forecasts and tins of pineapple chunks - not to mention the devastation left in the wake of J.'s small fox-terrier Montmorency. <i>Three Men in a Boat</i> was an instant success when it appeared in 1889, and, with its benign escapism, authorial discursions and wonderful evocation of the late-Victorian 'clerking classes', it hilariously captured the spirit of its age.<br /><br />In his introduction, Jeremy Lewis examines Jerome K. Jerome's life and times, and the changing world of Victorian England he depicts - from the rise of a new mass-culture of tabloids and bestselling novels to crazes for daytripping and bicycling.",

Marshaling a vast array of data and the personal stories of hundreds of men and women, Wilson persuasively argues that problems endemic to America's inner cities;from fatherless households to drugs and violent crime.<br />Wilson's achievement is to portray this crisis as one that affects all Americans, and to propose solutions whose benefits would be felt across our society. At a time when welfare is ending and our country's racial dialectic is more strained than ever.",

    "description": "<b><i>The Journals of Lewis and Clark</i> are \"the first report on the West, on the United States over the hill and beyond the sunset, on the province of the American future\" (Bernard DeVoto).</b><br /><br />In 1803, the great expanse of the Louisiana Purchase was an empty canvas. Keenly aware that the course of the nation's destiny lay westward\u2014and that a \"Voyage of Discovery\" would be necessary to determine the nature of the frontier\u2014President Thomas Jefferson commissioned Meriwether Lewis to lead an expedition from the Missouri River to the northern Pacific coast and back. From 1804 to 1806, accompanied by co-captain William Clark, the Shoshone guide Sacajawea, and thirty-two men, Lewis mapped rivers, traced the principal waterways to the sea, and established the American claim to the territories of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. Together the captains kept this journal: a richly detailed record of the flora and fauna they sighted, the native tribes they encountered, and the awe-inspiring landscape they traversed, from their base camp near present-day St. Louis to the mouth of the Columbia River, that has become an incomparable contribution to the literature of exploration and the writing of natural history.",

    "description": "Jim Grimsley's novels and short stories have been favorably compared to the works of Samuel R. Delany, Jack Vance, and Ursula K. Le Guin. Now he unleashes an ambitious and audacious collision between science and magic.<br /><br />The Twil Gate links two very different realms. On one side of the portal is Senal, an advanced technological civilization of some thirty billion inhabitants, all cybernetically linked and at war with machine intelligences many light-years away. On the other side is Irion, a land of myth and legend, where the world is flat and mighty wizards once ruled.<br /><br />Jedda Martele is a linguist and trader from Senal. Although fascinated by the languages and cultures of Irion, she shares her people's assumption that Irion is backward and superstitious and no match for her homeland's superior numbers and technology. But as the two realms march inevitably toward war, Jedda finds herself at the center of historic, unimaginable events that will challenge everything she has ever believed about the world--and herself.<br /><br /><i>The Ordinary</i> is a powerful and entrancing tale of magic, science, and the mysterious truth that binds them together.",

    "description": "\"Edith and Frances, living with their mother on a tiny farm in the south-west of Australia, are visited by their cousin Leopold and his Armenian friend Aram. The two young men are taking the long way home after working on an archeological dig in Iraq. It is 1937. The modern world, they say, is waiting to erupt. Among the tales they tell is the story of Gilgamesh, the legendary king of Uruk in ancient Mesopotamia. Gilamesh's great journey of mourning after the death of his friend Enkidu, and his search for the secret of eternal life, is to resonate through all of their lives. <br /><br />In 1939 Edith and her young child set off on an impossible journey of their own, to find themselves trapped by the outbreak of war. The story of this journey is the story of encounters and escapes, of friendship and love, of loss aqnd acceptance. <br /><br />Moving between rural Australia, London, the Caucasus and the Middle East, from the last days of the First World War to the years following the Second, Joan London's stunning novel examines what happens when we strike out into the worlld, and how, like Gagamesh, we find our way home.\" <br /><br />(from back cover of Picador book)",
