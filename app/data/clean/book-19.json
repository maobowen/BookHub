    "description": "The author of the international bestseller <b>A Suitable Boy</b> returns with a powerful and deeply romantic tale of two gifted musicians. Michael Holme is a violinist, a member of the successful Maggiore Quartet. He has long been haunted, though, by memories of the pianist he loved and left ten years earlier, Julia McNicholl. Now Julia, married and the mother of a small child, unexpectedly reenters his life and the romance flares up once more.<br /><br /> Against the magical backdrop of Venice and Vienna, the two lovers confront the truth about themselves and their love, about the music that both unites and divides them, and about a devastating secret that Julia must finally reveal. With poetic, evocative writing and a brilliant portrait of the international music scene, <b>An Equal Music</b> confirms Vikram Seth as one of the world's finest and most enticing writers.",

Are they from Alice\u2019s long-disappeared, treasure-hunting father? Are they from someone who knows that her cryptanalyst grandfather left her the key to finding that treasure? Is quiet Ben, Alice\u2019s new love, hiding something that could help her discover their source? And could it be that these codes will lead Alice to a secret even more carefully guarded than her own?",

    "description": "<b>The Hundred Secret Senses</b> is an exultant novel about China and America, love and loyalty, the identities we invent and the true selves we discover along the way. Olivia Laguni is half-Chinese, but typically American in her uneasiness with her patchwork family. And no one in Olivia's family is more embarrassing to her than her half-sister, Kwan Li. For Kwan speaks mangled English, is cheerfully deaf to Olivia's sarcasm, and sees the dead with her \"yin eyes.\"<br /><br />Even as Olivia details the particulars of her decades-long grudge against her sister (who, among other things, is a source of infuriatingly good advice), Kwan Li is telling her own story, one that sweeps us into the splendor, squalor, and violence of Manchu China. And out of the friction between her narrators, Amy Tan creates a work that illuminates both the present and the past sweetly, sadly, hilariously, with searing and vivid prose.",

    "description": "An ingenious tour de force: an utterly compelling historical mystery with a plot that twists and turns and keeps the reader guessing until the very last page.<br /><br />We are in England in the 1660s. Charles II has been restored to the throne following years of civil war and Cromwell's short-lived republic. Oxford is the intellectual seat of the country, a place of great scientific, religious, and political ferment. A fellow of New College is found dead in suspicious circumstances. A young woman is accused of his murder. We hear the story of the death from four witnesses: an Italian physician intent on claiming credit for the invention of blood transfusion; the son of an alleged Royalist traitor; a master cryptographer who has worked for both Cromwell and the king; and a renowned Oxford antiquarian. Each tells his own version of what happened. Only one reveals the extraordinary truth.<br /><br />With rights sold for record-breaking sums around the world, An Instance of the Fingerpost is destined to become a major international publishing event. Deserving of comparison to the works of John Fowles and Umberto Eco, Iain Pears's novel is an ingenious tour de force: an utterly compelling historical mystery with a plot that twists and turns and keeps the reader guessing until the very last page.",

The life story, character and friends of Jacob are presented in a series for separate scenes and moments from his childhood, through college at Cambridge, love affairs in London, and travels in Greece, to his death in the war. <i>Jacob's Room</i> established Virginia Woolf's reputation as a highly poetic and symbolic writer who places emphasis not on plot or action but on the psychological realm of occupied by her characters.",

    "description": "<b><i>Downriver </i>is a brilliant London novel by its foremost chronicler, Iain Sinclair.</b><br /><b></b><br /><b>WINNER OF THE ENCORE AWARD AND THE JAMES TAIT BLACK MEMORIAL PRIZE</b><br /><br />The Thames runs through <i>Downriver </i>like an open wound, draining the pain and filth of London and its mercurial inhabitants. Commissioned to document the shifting embankments of industry and rampant property speculation, a film crew of magpie scavengers, high-rent lowlife, broken criminals and reborn lunatics picks over the rivers detritus. They examine the wound, hoping to expose the cause of the city's affliction . . .<br /><br />'Remarkable: part apocalyptic documentary, part moth-eaten ghost story, part detective story. Inventive and stylish, Sinclair is one of the most interesting of contemporary novelists' <i>Sunday Times</i><br /><br />'One of those idiosyncratic literary texts that revivify the language, so darn quotable as to be the reader's delight and the reviewer's nightmare' <i>Guardian</i><br /><i></i><br /><i></i>'Crazy, dangerous, prophetic' <b>Angela Carter</b><br /><b></b><br /><b></b><br />Iain Sinclair is the author of <i>Downriver</i> (winner of the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Encore Award); <i>Landor's Tower</i>; <i>White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings</i>; <i>Lights Out for the Territory</i>; <i>Lud Heat</i>; <i>Rodinsky's Room</i> (with Rachel Lichtenstein); <i>Radon Daughters;</i> <i>London Orbital</i>, <i>Dining on Stones</i><i>, Hackney, that Rose-Red Empire</i> and <i>Ghost Milk</i>. He is also the editor of <i>London: City of Disappearances</i>.",

Like no other work, Through a Glass Darkly is infused with intrigue, sweetened by romance and awash in the black ink of betrayal.",

    "description": "In the sleepy English countryside of decades past, there is a town that has stood on a jut of granite for six hundred years. And immediately to the east stands a high stone wall, for which the village is named. Here in the town of Wall, Tristran Thorn has lost his heart to the hauntingly beautiful Victoria Forester. One crisp October night, as they watch, a star falls from the sky, and Victoria promises to marry Tristran if he'll retrieve that star and bring it back for her. It is this promise that sends Tristran through the only gap in the wall, across the meadow, and into the most unforgettable adventure of his life.",

    "description": "When the first edition of <i>The Media Monopoly</i> was published in 1983, critics called Ben Bagdikian's warnings about the chilling effects of corporate ownership and mass advertising on the nation's news \"alarmist.\" Since then, the number of corporations controlling most of America's daily newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations, book publishers, and movie companies has dwindled from fifty to ten to five.<br /><br />The most respected critique of modern mass media ever issued is now published in a completely updated and revised twentieth anniversary edition.<br /><br />'Ben Bagdikian has written the first great media book of the twenty-first century. The New Media Monopoly will provide a roadmap to understanding how we got here and where we need to go to make matters better.' <br />-Robert McChesney, author of <i>Rich Media, Poor Democracy</i>",

Small business consultant and author Michael E. Gerber, with sharp insight gained from years of experience, points out how common assumptions, expectations, and even technical expertise can get in the way of running a successful business.<br /><br />Gerber walks you through the steps in the life of a business\u2014from entrepreneurial infancy through adolescent growing pains to the mature entrepreneurial perspective: the guiding light of all businesses that succeed\u2014and shows how to apply the lessons of franchising to any business, whether or not it is a franchise. Most importantly, Gerber draws the vital, often overlooked distinction between working <em>on</em> your business and working <em>in</em> your business.<br /><br /><em>The E-Myth Revisited</em> will help you grow your business in a productive, assured way.",

    "description": "For seven decades Katharine Hepburn played a leading role in the popular culture of the twentieth century - reigning as an admired actress, a beloved movie star, and a treasured icon of the modern American woman. She also remained one of the most private of all the public figures of her time.<br /><br />In 1983 - at the age of seventy-five, her career cresting - the four-time Academy Award winner opened the door to biographer A. Scott Berg - then thirty-three - and began a special friendship, one that endured to the end of her illustrious life.<br /><br />From the start, Scott Berg felt that Katharine Hepburn intended his role to be not just that of a friend but also of a chronicler, a confidant who might record for posterity her thoughts and feelings. Over the next twenty years, Kate used their many hours together to reveal all that came to mind, often reflecting on the people and episodes of her past, occasionally on the meaning of life.<br /><br />Here are the stories from those countless intimate conversations, and much more. In addition to recording heretofore untold biographical details of her entire phenomenal career and her famous relationships with such men as Spencer Tracy and Howard Hughes, <b>Kate Remembered</b> also tells the amusing, often emotional story of one of the most touching friendships in her final years. Scott Berg provides his own memories of Katharine Hepburn offstage - quiet dinners in her town house in New York City, winter swims (she swam, he watched) in the Long Island Sound at Fenwick, her home in Connecticut, weekend visits with family members and dear friends...even some unusual appearances by the likes of Michael Jackson and Warren Beatty. Finally, <i>Kate Remembered</i> discusses the legendary actress's moving farewell, during which her mighty personality surrendered at last to her failing body - all the while remaining true to her courageous character.<br /><br /><i>Kate Remembered</i> is a book about love and friendship, family and career, Hollywood and Broadway - all punctuated by unforgettable lessons from an extraordinary life.",

Her long experience\u2014not only through her roles as mother, daughter, sister, and wife but also as advocate, legal expert, and public servant\u2014has strengthened her conviction that how children develop and what they need to succeed are inextricably entwined with the society in which they live and how well it sustains and supports its families and individuals. In other words, it takes a village to raise a child.<br /><br />In her new Introduction, Senator Clinton reflects on how our village has changed over the last decade\u2014from the impact of the Internet to new research in early child development and education. She discusses issues of increasing concern\u2014security, the environment, the national debt\u2014and looks at where we have made progress and where there is still work to be done.<br /><br /><i>It Takes a Village</i> has become a classic. As relevant as ever, this anniversary edition makes it abundantly clear that the choices we make today about how we raise our children and how we support families will determine how our nation will face the challenges of this century.",

    "description": "\"To you, perceptive reader, I bequeath my history...\"<br /><br />Late one night, exploring her father's library, a young woman finds an ancient book and a cache of yellowing letters. The letters are all addressed to \"My dear and unfortunate successor,\" and they plunge her into a world she never dreamed of\u2014a labyrinth where the secrets of her father's past and her mother's mysterious fate connect to an inconceivable evil hidden in the depths of history.<br /><br />The letters provide links to one of the darkest powers that humanity has ever known\u2014and to a centuries-long quest to find the source of that darkness and wipe it out. It is a quest for the truth about Vlad the Impaler, the medieval ruler whose barbarous reign formed the basis of the legend of Dracula. Generations of historians have risked their reputations, their sanity, and even their lives to learn the truth about Vlad the Impaler and Dracula. Now one young woman must decide whether to take up this quest herself\u2014to follow her father in a hunt that nearly brought him to ruin years ago, when he was a vibrant young scholar and her mother was still alive.<br /><br />Parsing obscure signs and hidden texts, reading codes worked into the fabric of medieval monastic traditions\u2014and evading the unknown adversaries who will go to any lengths to conceal and protect Vlad's ancient powers\u2014one woman comes ever closer to the secret of her own past and a confrontation with the very definition of evil. Elizabeth's Kostova's debut novel is an adventure of monumental proportions, a relentless tale that blends fact and fantasy, history and the present, with an assurance that is almost unbearably suspenseful\u2014and utterly unforgettable.<br /><br /><i>An unabridged production on 22 CDs (26 hours, 6 minutes).</i>",

His good looks had a dangerous, almost cruel quality that had frightened me. But now I knew he could smile, I thought his face exciting, in a way no face had ever excited me before \u2026\u2019<br /><br />Vivienne Michel is in trouble. Trying to escape her tangled past, she has run away to the American backwoods, winding up at the Dreamy Pines Motor Court. A far cry from the privileged world she was born to, the motel is also the destination of two hardened killers\u2014the perverse Sol Horror and the deadly Sluggsy Morant. When a coolly charismatic Englishman turns up, Viv, in terrible danger, is not just hopeful, but fascinated. Because he is James Bond, 007; the man she hopes will save her, the spy she hopes will love her \u2026",

    "description": "<i>Hunger of Memory</i> is the story of Mexican-American Richard Rodriguez, who begins his schooling in Sacramento, California, knowing just 50 words of English, and concludes his university studies in the stately quiet of the reading room of the British Museum. <br /><br />Here is the poignant journey of a minority student who pays the cost of his social assimilation and academic success with a painful alienation--from his past, his parents, his culture--and so describes the high price of making it in middle-class America. <br /><br />Provocative in its positions on affirmative action and bilingual education, <i>Hunger of Memory</i> is a powerful political statement, a profound study of the importance of language and the moving, intimate portrait of a boy struggling to become a man.<br /><br /><br />",

    "description": "Nick Drake was barely 26 years old when he died in 1974 following an accidental overdose of prescribed drugs. The British singer-songwriter made only three albums during his short life - Five Leaves Left, Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. All are now recognized as classics.<br /><br />Since his death, Nick has been cited as a seminal influence by stars as diverse as REM, Elton John, and Paul Weller. While the lives of other musicians who died before their time, such as Jim Morrison, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Gram Parsons, have been amply documented, there has never before been a biography of Nick Drake. Patrick Humphries' illuminating text includes exclusive interviews with friends, colleagues and musicians who knew and worked with Nick. It provides an unprecedented insight not only into the life and work of Nick Drake, but also into the music scene of the 1960s that formed his backdrop.<br /><br />If a week is a long time in politics, then the 23 years since Nick's death represents a lifetime in the transitory world of pop. But the music of Nick Drake has never lost its place in his fans affections, and still its haunting beauty reaches out of fresh generations. This book is for all of them.",

    "description": "Audere, agere, auferre. To dare, to strive, to conquer. For generations, privileged young men have attended St. Oswald's Grammar School for Boys, groomed for success by the likes of Roy Straitley, the eccentric Classics teacher who has been a fixture there for more than thirty years. But this year the wind of unwelcome change is blowing. Suits, paperwork, and information technology are beginning to overshadow St. Oswald's tradition, and Straitley is finally, and reluctantly, contemplating retirement. He is joined this term by five new faculty members, including one who -- unbeknownst to Straitley and everyone else -- holds intimate and dangerous knowledge of St. Oswald's ways and secrets. Harboring dark ties to the school's past, this young teacher has arrived with one terrible goal: to destroy St. Oswald's.<br /><br />As the new term gets under way, a number of incidents befall students and faculty alike. Beginning as small annoyances -- a lost pen, a misplaced coffee mug -- they are initially overlooked. But as the incidents escalate in both number and consequence, it soon becomes apparent that a darker undercurrent is stirring within the school. With St. Oswald's unraveling, only Straitley stands in the way of its ruin. The veteran teacher faces a formidable opponent, however -- a master player with a bitter grudge and a strategy that has been meticulously planned to the final move, a secret game with very real, very deadly consequences.<br /><br />A harrowing tale of cat and mouse, this riveting, hypnotically atmospheric novel showcases <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Joanne Harris's astonishing storytelling talent as never before.",

Now a new threat leaves Reason stranded alone in New York City, struggling to control a power she barely understands. But could the danger she faces also hold the key to saving her life? \"Magic Lessons\" is a stunning follow-up to Larbalestier's debut novel, \"Magic or Madness, \" which earned multiple starred reviews and a spot on the Locus 2005 Recommended Reading List, along with being named a Best Book of the Year by \"School Library Journal\" and the Young Adult Round Table of the TLA.",

In it, visionary architect Sarah Susanka embraced the notion of smaller, simpler shelters that better meet the needs of the way we live today. The book created a groundswell of interest among homeowners, architects, and builders. More than 200 photographs bring the spirit of the \"\"Not So Big\"\" house alive.",

Wolf Star Rise is the stuff of nightmares, with rooms that change and move for no apparent reason. The only human there is Prince Venn. Neither Claidi nor Venn knows why they are at the Rise. Can the two escape from the maze of taboo, repression, and mystery surrounding both of their long-lost families?<br /><br /><i>The Claidi Journals</i> are \"a diverting escapade for fans of Karen Cushman's Catherine, Called Birdy and Gail Carson Levine's Ella Enchanted.\"(<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)",

    "description": "In 1876 a group of Poles led by Maryna Zalewska, Poland's greatest actress, travel to California to found a \"utopian\" commune. Maryna, who has renounced her career, is accompanied by her small son and husband; in her entourage is a rising young writer who is in love with her. The novel portrays a West that is still largely empty, where white settlers confront native Californians and Asian coolies. The image of America, and of California-as fantasy, as escape, as radical simplification-constantly meets a more complex reality. The commune fails and most of the migrants go home, but Maryna stays and triumphs on the American stage.<br /><br /><i>In America</i> is a big, juicy, surprising book-about a woman's search for self-transformation, about the fate of idealism, about the world of the theater-that will captivate its readers from the first page. It is Sontag's most delicious, most brilliant achievement.",

    "description": "In 1974 in Kinshasa, Za\u00efre, two African American boxers were paid five million dollars apiece to fight each other. One was Muhammad Ali, the aging but irrepressible \u201cprofessor of boxing.\u201d The other was George Foreman, who was as taciturn as Ali was voluble. Observing them was Norman Mailer, a commentator of unparalleled energy, acumen, and audacity. Whether he is analyzing the fighters\u2019 moves, interpreting their characters, or weighing their competing claims on the African and American souls, Mailer\u2019s grasp of the titanic battle\u2019s feints and stratagems\u2014and his sensitivity to their deeper symbolism\u2014makes this book a masterpiece of the literature of sport.<br /> \u00a0<br /><b>Praise for <i>The Fight</i></b><br /><i>\u00a0</i><br /> \u201cExquisitely refined and attenuated . . . [a] sensitive portrait of an extraordinary athlete and man, and a pugilistic drama fully as exciting as the reality on which it is based.\u201d<b>\u2014<i>The New York Times</i></b> <br /> \u00a0<br /> \u201cOne of the defining texts of sports journalism. Not only does Mailer recall the violent combat with a scholar\u2019s eye . . . he also makes the whole act of reporting seem as exciting as what\u2019s occurring in the ring.\u201d<b>\u2014<i>GQ</i></b><br /> \u00a0<br /> \u201cStylistically, Mailer was the greatest boxing writer of all time.\u201d<b>\u2014Chuck Klosterman, <i>Esquire</i></b><br /> \u00a0<br /> \u201cOne of Mailer\u2019s finest books.\u201d<b>\u2014Louis Menand, <i>The New Yorker</i></b><br /><b>\u00a0</b><br /><b>Praise for Norman Mailer</b><br /><b>\u00a0</b><br /> \u201c[Norman Mailer] loomed over American letters longer and larger than any other writer of his generation.\u201d<b>\u2014<i>The New York Times</i></b><br /> \u00a0<br /> \u201cA writer of the greatest and most reckless talent.\u201d<b>\u2014<i>The New Yorker</i></b><br /> \u00a0<br /> \u201cMailer is indispensable, an American treasure.\u201d<b>\u2014<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br /> \u00a0<br /> \u201cA devastatingly alive and original creative mind.\u201d<b>\u2014<i>Life</i></b><br /> \u00a0<br /> \u201cMailer is fierce, courageous, and reckless and nearly everything he writes has sections of headlong brilliance.\u201d<b>\u2014<i>The New York Review of Books</i></b><br /> \u00a0<br /> \u201cThe largest mind and imagination [in modern] American literature . . .

Odessa is not known to be a town big on dreams, but the Panthers help keep the hopes and dreams of this small, dusty town going. Socially and racially divided, its fragile economy follows the treacherous boom-bust path of the oil business.In bad times, the unemployment rate barrels out of control; in good times, its murder rate skyrockets. But every Friday night from September to December, when the Permian High School Panthers play football, this West Texas town becomes a place where dreams can come true. With frankness and compassion, Bissinger chronicles one of the Panthers' dramatic seasons and shows how single-minded devotion to the team shapes the community and inspires-and sometimes shatters-the teenagers who wear the Panthers' uniforms. Includes Reader's Group Guide inside. Now a major motion picture starring Billy Bob Thorton.</div>",

That rule was soon abandoned, and since then McSweeney\u2019s has attracted work from some of the finest writers in the country, including Denis Johnson, Jonathan Franzen, William T. Vollmann, Rick Moody, Joyce Carol Oates, Heidi Julavits, Jonathan Lethem, Michael Chabon, Ben Marcus, Susan Straight, Roddy Doyle, T.C. Boyle, Steven Millhauser, Gabe Hudson, Robert Coover, Ann Beattie, and many others. At the same time, the journal continues to be a major home for new and unpublished writers; we\u2019re committed to publishing exciting fiction regardless of pedigree.\n    \n    Each issue of the quarterly is completely redesigned. There have been hardcovers and paperbacks, an issue with two spines, an issue with a magnetic binding, an issue that looked like a bundle of junk mail, and an issue that looked like a sweaty human head. McSweeney\u2019s has won multiple literary awards, including two National Magazine Awards for fiction, and has had numerous stories appear in The Best American Magazine Writing, the O. Henry Awards anthologies, and The Best American Short Stories. Design awards given to the quarterly include the AIGA 50 Books Award, the AIGA 365 Illustration Award, and the Print Design Regional Award.",

    "description": "<i>As You Like It</i> is a pastoral comedy by William Shakespeare believed to have been written in 1599 or early 1600 and first published in the First Folio, 1623. The play's first performance is uncertain, though a performance at Wilton House in 1603 has been suggested as a possibility. <i>As You Like It</i> follows its heroine Rosalind as she flees persecution in her uncle's court, accompanied by her cousin Celia and Touchstone the court jester, to find safety and, eventually, love, in the Forest of Arden. <br /><br />Historically, critical response has varied, with some critics finding the work of lesser quality than other Shakespearean works and some finding the play a work of great merit. The play features one of Shakespeare's most famous and oft-quoted speeches, \"All the world's a stage\", and is the origin of the phrase \"too much of a good thing\". The play remains a favourite among audiences and has been adapted for radio, film, and musical theatre.",

Here he turns an unflinching eye to the men, women, and children caught between the old ways of the South and the temptations that await them in the city, people who in Jones's masterful hands emerge as fully human and morally complex. With the legacy of slavery just a stone's throw behind them and the future uncertain, Jones's cornucopia of characters will haunt readers for years to come.",

    "description": "\"Now and then,\" writes Lionel Triling \"it is possible to observe the moral life in process of revising itself.\" In this new book he is concerned with such a mutation: the process by which the arduous enterprise of sincerity, of being true to one's self, came to occupy a place of supreme importance in the moral life--and the further shift which finds that place now usurped by the darker and still more strenuous modern ideal of authenticity. Instances range over the whole of Western literature and thought, from Shakespeare to Hegel to Sartre, from Robespierre to R.D. Laing, suggesting the contradictions and ironies to which the ideals of sincerity and authenticity give rise, most especially in contemporary life. Lucid, and brilliantly framed, its view of cultural history will give <i>Sincerity and Authenticity</i> an important place among the works of this distinguished critic.",

Georgette George does not know what to make of her brilliant, idealistic roommate, Ann Drayton, and her obsessive disdain for the ruling class into which she was born. She is mortified by Ann's romanticization of the underprivileged class, which Georgette herself is hoping college will enable her to escape. After the violent fight that ends their friendship, Georgette wants only to forget Ann and to turn her attention to the troubled runaway kid sister who has reappeared after years on the road. Then, in 1976, Ann is convicted of murder. At first, Ann's fate appears to be the inevitable outcome of her belief in the moral imperative to \"make justice\" in a world where \"there are no innocent white people.\" But, searching for answers to the riddle of this friend of her youth, Georgette finds more complicated and mysterious forces at work.<br /><br />The novel's narrator Georgette illuminates the terrifying life of this difficult, doomed woman, and in the process discovers how much their early encounter has determined her own path, and why, decades later, as she tells us, \"I have never stopped thinking about her.\"",

    "description": "For the first three decades of the twentieth century, the Marchesa Casati astounded Europe: nude servants gilded in gold leaf attended her; bizarre wax mannequins sat as guests at her dining table; and she was infamous for her evening strolls, naked beneath her furs, parading cheetahs on diamond-studded leashes. Artists painted, sculpted, and photographed her; poets praised her strange beauty. Among them were Gabriele D\u2019Annunzio, Man Ray, Jean Cocteau, Cecil Beaton, and American writers Tennessee Williams, Jack Kerouac, and Ezra Pound. Couturiers Fortuny, Poiret, and Ert\u00e9 dressed her. Some became lovers, others awestruck admirers, but all were influenced by this extraordinary muse. The extravagance ended in 1930 when Casati was more than twenty-five million dollars in debt. Fleeing to London, she spent her final flamboyant years there until her death in 1957. Now nearly a half-century later, Casati\u2019s fashion legacy continues to inspire such designers as John Galliano, Karl Lagerfeld, and Tom Ford. Fully authorized and accurate, this is the fantastic story of the Marchesa Luisa Casati.Scot D. Ryersson is an award-winning freelance writer, illustrator, and graphic designer. He lives in New Jersey.Michael Orlando Yaccarino is a freelance writer specializing in international genre film, fashion, music, and unconventional historical figures. He lives in New Jersey.",

Now, like us, these three lost girls have grown up and are ready to guide us again, this time through the realms of our sexual awakening and fulfillment. Through their familiar fairy tales they share with us their most intimate revelations of desire in its many forms... revelations that shine out radiantly through the dark clouds of war gathering around a luxury Austrian hotel.<br /><br />Drawing on the rich heritage of erotica, <i>Lost Girls</i> is the rediscovery of the power of ecstatic writing and art in a sublime union that only the medium of comics can achieve. Exquisite, thoughtful, and human, <i>Lost Girls</i> is a work of breathtaking scope that challenges the very notion of art fettered by convention. This is erotic fiction at its finest.<br /><br />Similar to DC's Absolute editions of <i>Watchmen</i> and <i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i>, <i>Lost Girls</i> will be published as three, 112-page, super-deluxe, ovesized hardcover volumes, all sealed in a gorgeous slipcase. It will truly be an edition for the ages.",

    "description": "When Jeffrey Steingarten was appointed food critic for <i>Vogue</i>, he systematically set out to overcome his distaste for such things as kimchi, lard, Greek cuisine, and blue food. He succeeded at all but the last: Steingarten is \"fairly sure that God meant the color blue mainly for food that has gone bad.\" In this impassioned, mouth-watering, and outrageously funny book, Steingarten devotes the same Zen-like discipline and gluttonous curiosity to practically everything that anyone anywhere has ever called \"dinner.\" <br /><br />Follow Steingarten as he jets off to sample choucroute in Alsace, hand-massaged beef in Japan, and the mother of all ice creams in Sicily. Sweat with him as he tries to re-create the perfect sourdough, bottle his own mineral water, and drop excess poundage at a luxury spa. Join him as he mounts a heroic--and hilarious--defense of salt, sugar, and fat (though he has some nice things to say about Olestra). Stuffed with offbeat erudition and recipes so good they ought to be illegal, <i>The Man Who Ate Everything</i> is a gift for anyone who loves food.",

No one, they warn, is out of their reach\u2014not even the president.<br /><br />A joint FBI-CIA task force reveals the killers are elite military commandos, but no one knows exactly who they are or when they will strike next.

    "description": "In <i>Bambi vs. Godzilla</i>, David Mamet, the award-winning playwright and screenwriter, gives us an exhilaratingly subversive inside look at Hollywood from the perspective of a filmmaker who has always played the game his own way.<br /><br />Who really reads the scripts at the film studios? How is a screenplay like a personals ad? Whose opinion matters when revising a screenplay? Why are there so many producers listed in movie credits? And what the hell do those producers do, anyway? Refreshingly unafraid to offend, Mamet provides hilarious, surprising, and bracingly forthright answers to these and other questions about virtually every aspect of filmmaking, from concept to script to screen. <br /><br />He covers topics ranging from \u201cHow Scripts Got So Bad\u201d to the oxymoron of \u201cManners in Hollywood.\u201d He takes us step-by-step through some of his favorite movie stunts and directorial tricks, and demonstrates that it is craft and crew, not stars and producers, that make great films. He tells us who his favorite actors and what his favorite movies are, who he thinks is the most perfect actor to grace the screen, and who he thinks should never have appeared there.<br /><br />Demigods and sacred cows of the movie business\u2013beware! But for the rest of us, Mamet speaking truth to Hollywood makes for searingly enjoyable reading.",

    "description": "<i>Film Art</i> is often assigned to college students taking their first film class. Authors David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson do not follow the traditional method of teaching film art through a close analysis of individual films. Instead, they provide an overview of the major issues students confront when they watch movies. In clear, straightforward prose, the authors describe and dissect the complexities of filmmaking, film narrative, film form, and film technique. This book serves as a fine introduction not only to the field of film studies, but also to the theories and concerns of two of the most important scholars in that field.",

There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues.<br /><br />As Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. <b>In Cold Blood</b> is a work that transcends its moment, yielding poignant insights into the nature of American violence.",

    "description": "Christians often talk about claiming our cities for Christ and the need to address urban concerns. But according to Eric Jacobsen, this discussion has remained far too abstract. <i>Sidewalks in the Kingdom</i> challenges Christians to gain an informed vision for the physical layout and structure of the city.<br /><br />Jacobsen emphasizes the need to preserve the nourishing characteristics of traditional city life, including shared public spaces, thriving neighborhoods, and a well-supported local economy. He explains how urban settings create unexpected and natural opportunities to initiate friendship and share faith in Christ.<br /><br />Helpful features include a glossary, a bibliography, and a description of New Urbanism. Pastors, city-dwellers, and those interested in urban ministry and development will be encouraged by <i>Sidewalks in the Kingdom</i>.",

Working out of an old church belfry, Kenzie and Gennaro take on a seemingly simple assignment for a prominent politician: to uncover the whereabouts of Jenna Angeline, a black cleaning woman who has allegedly stolen confidential state documents.<p>Finding Jenna, however, is easy compared to staying alive once they've got her. The investigation escalates, implicating members of Jenna's family and rival gang leaders while uncovering extortion, assassination, and child prostitution extending from bombed-out ghetto streets to the highest levels of government.</p><p>\n  <i>A Drink Before the War</i>\n</p>",

The\u00a0Batman, a forgotten icon from the past, is wanted for the murder. Amid the chaos Gotham City Police Detective Gordon, grandson\u00a0of the former commissioner, discovers that the man they are chasing shouldn't exist at all.",

    "description": "In his first case since he left the LAPD's Open Unsolved Unit for the prestigious Homicide Special squad, Harry Bosch is called out to investigate a murder that may have chilling consequences for national security. A doctor with access to a dangerous radioactive substance is found murdered in the trunk of his car. Retracing his steps, Harry learns that a large quantity of radioactive cesium was stolen shortly before the doctor's death. With the cesium in unknown hands, Harry fears the murder could be part of a terrorist plot to poison a major American city.<p>Soon, Bosch is in a race against time, not only against the culprits, but also against the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI (in the form of Harry's one-time lover Rachel Walling), who are convinced that this case is too important for the likes of the LAPD. It is Bosch's job to prove all of them wrong.</p>",

    "description": "<b>Dan Savage</b>'s nationally syndicated sex advice column, \"Savage Love,\" enrages and excites more than four million people each week. In <b>The Kid</b>, Savage tells a no-holds-barred, high-energy story of an ordinary American couple who wants to have a baby. Except that in this case the couple happens to be Dan and his boyfriend. That fact, in the face of a society enormously uneasy with gay adoption, makes for an edgy, entertaining, and illuminating read. When Dan and his boyfriend are finally presented with an infant badly in need of parenting, they find themselves caught up in a drama that extends well beyond the confines of their immediate world. A story about confronting homophobia, falling in love, getting older, and getting a little bit smarter, The Kid is a book about the very human desire to have a family.",

    "description": "Paul Bowles once said that a story should remain taut throughout, like a piece of string. That tense, stretched tone is the key to this collection of 17 eerie tales by the author best known for <i>The Sheltering Sky</i>. <i>The Delicate Prey</i> is dedicated: \"For my mother, who first read me the stories of Poe.\" If Poe had lived in Mexico, and he'd had ice water running in his veins to counteract his feverish romanticism, he might have crafted something like these odd vignettes about human frailty and cruelty. The setting is a world where palm trees are like \"shiny green spiders,\" where bats reel silently overhead in a jet-black sky, where a hot, relentless wind blows across deserted plazas. <p> As Tobias Wolff writes in <i>Esquire</i>, \"<i>The Delicate Prey</i> is in fact one of the most profound, beautifully wrought, and haunting collections in our literature.... Bowles's tales are at once austere, witty, violent, and sensuous. They move with the inevitability of myth. His language has a purity of line, a poise and authority entirely its own, capable of instantly modulating from farce to horror without a ruffle.\"</p>",

Delving deeply into the Mormon ritual of blood sacrifice used in the murders, Rudd, along with his newly discovered half-brother, Lael, becomes swept up in the psychological and atavistic effects of this violent, antique ritual.</p>\n  <p><br />As the past and the present become an increasingly tangled knot, Rudd is found at the scene of a multiple murder at a remote campsite with minor injuries and few memories. Lyndi, the daughter of the victims, tries to help Rudd recover his memory and, together, they find a strength unique to survivors of terrible tragedies. But Rudd, desperate to protect Lyndi and unable to let the past be still, tries to manipulate their Mormon wedding ceremony to trick the priests (and God) by giving himself and Lyndi new secret names\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnames that match the killer and the victim in the one hundred-year-old murder. The nightmare has just begun . . .</p>\n</div>",

    "description": "Though she wrote only one novella, one short play, and fewer than a dozen short stories over a roughly twenty-year span from the early 1940s to the mid-1960s, Jane Bowles has long been regarded by critics as one of the premier stylists of her generation. Enlivened at unexpected moments by sexual exploration, mysticism, and flashes of wit alternately dry and hilarious, her prose is spare and honed, her stories filled with subtly sly characterizations of men and, mostly, women, dissatisfied not so much with the downward spiral of their fortunes as with the hollowness of their neat little lives. Whether focused on the separate emergences of Miss Goering and Mrs. Copperfield from their affluent, airless lives in New York and Panama into a less defined but intense sexual and social maelstrom in the novella <i>Two Serious Ladies</i>, or on the doomed efforts of the neighbors Mr. Drake and Mrs. Perry to form a connection out of their very different loneliness in \"Plain Pleasures,\" or on the bittersweet cultural collision of an American wife and a peasant woman in Morocco in \"Everything Is Nice,\" Jane Bowles creates whole worlds out of the unexpressed longings of individuals, adrift in their own lives, whether residing in their childhood homes or in faraway lands that are somehow both stranger and more familiar than what they left behind.",

    "description": "Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales are like exquisite jewels, drawing from us gasps of recognition and delight. Writing in the midst of a Europe-wide rebirth of national literature, Anderson broke new ground with his fairy tales in two important ways. First, he composed them in the vernacular, mimicking the language he used in telling them to children aloud. Second, he set his tales in his own land and time, giving rise to his loving descriptions of the Danish countryside. In contrast to such folklorists as the Brothers Grimm, Anderson\u2019s tales are grounded in the real and often focus on the significance of small or overlooked things.<br /><br />Tinderbox --<br />Little Claus and big Claus --<br />Princess on the pea --<br />Thumbelina --<br />Traveling companion --<br />Little mermaid --<br />Emperor's new clothes --<br />Steadfast tin soldier --<br />Wild swans --<br />Flying trunk --<br />Nightingale --<br />Sweethearts --<br />Ugly duckling --<br />Fir tree --<br />Snow queen --<br />Red shoes --<br />Shepherdess and the chimney sweep --<br />Shadow --<br />Old house --<br />Little match girl --<br />Story of a mother --<br />Collar --<br />Bell --<br />Marsh King's daughter --<br />Wind tells of Valdemar Daae and his daughters --<br />Snowman --<br />Ice maiden --<br />Wood nymph --<br />Most incredible thing --<br />Auntie toothache.",

    "description": "When Johnson went to work for the U.S. Antarctic Program (devoted to scientific research and education in support of the national interest in the Antarctic), he figured he'd find adventure, beauty, penguins and lofty-minded scientists. Instead, he found boredom, alcohol and bureaucracy. As a dishwasher and garbage man at McMurdo Station, Johnson quickly shed his illusions about Antarctica. Since he and his co-workers seldom ventured beyond the station's grim, functional buildings, they spent most of their time finding ways to entertain themselves, drinking beer, bowling and making home movies. The dormlike atmosphere, complete with sexual hijinks and obscene costume parties, sometimes made life there feel like \"a cheap knock-off of some original meaty experience.\" What dangers there were existed mostly in the psychological realm; most people who were there through the winter developed the \"Antarctica stare,\" an unnerving tendency to forget what they were saying mid-sentence and gaze dumbly at the station walls. And if the cold and isolation didn't drive one crazy, the petty hatreds and mindless red tape might. Though occasionally rambling and uneven, this memoir offers an insider's look at a place that few people know anything about and fewer still have ever seen.<br /><br />Johnson\u2019s savagely funny [book] is a grunt\u2019s-eye view of fear and loathing, arrogance and insanity in a dysfunctional, dystopian closed community. It\u2019s like <i>M*A*S*H</i> on ice, a bleak, black comedy.\u201d\u2014<i>The Times</i> of London",

    "description": "The concluding volume of the Border trilogy. In this magnificent new novel, the National Book Award-winning author of <i>All the Pretty Horses</i> and <i>The Crossing</i> fashions a darkly beautiful elegy for the American frontier. It is 1952 and John Grady Cole and Billy Parham are working as ranch hands in New Mexico, not far from the proving grounds of Alamogordo and the cities of El Paso and Juarez. Their life is made up of trail drives and horse auctions and stories told by campfire light. They value that life all the more because they know it is about to change forever.<br /><br />The change comes when John Grady falls in love with a beautiful, ill-starred Mexican prostitute and sets in motion a chain of events as violent as they are unstoppable. Haunting in its beauty, filled with sorrow, humor, and awe, <i>Cities of the Plain</i> is a genuine American epic.",

    "description": "'The only four things that interested me were: reading books, going to the movies, tap-dancing and drawing pictures. Then one day I started writing . . .' Truman Capote began writing at the age of eight, and never looked back. <i>A Capote Reader</i> contains much of the author's published work: his brilliant and prolific oeuvre of fiction, travel sketches, portraits, reportage and essays. It includes all twelve of his celebrated short stories, together with <i>The Grass Harp and Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>. There are vivid sketches of places from Tangiers to Brooklyn, and fascinating insights into the lives of his contemporaries, from Jane Bowles and Cecil Beaton to Marilyn Monroe and Tennessee Williams. Generous space is devoted to reportage including '<i>The Muses Are Heard'</i>, on his trip to Communist Europe in the 1950s with the cast of Porgy and Bess. In all, <i>A Capote Reader</i> demonstrates the chameleon talents of one of America's most versatile and gifted writers.",

    "description": "<p><b><i>New York Times</i> Bestseller<br /><br /><i>Today Show</i> Book Club Selection</b><br /><br />Audrey Niffenegger's innovative debut, <b>The Time Traveler's Wife</b>, is the story of Clare, a beautiful art student, and Henry, an adventuresome librarian, who have known each other since Clare was six and Henry was thirty-six, and were married when Clare was twenty-three and Henry thirty-one. Impossible but true, because Henry finds himself periodically displaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity from his life, past and future. His disappearances are spontaneous, his experiences unpredictable, alternately harrowing and amusing.<br /><br /><b>The Time Traveler\u2019s Wife</b><i> </i>depicts the effects of time travel on Henry and Clare's marriage and their passionate love for each other, as the story unfolds from both points of view. Clare and Henry attempt to live normal lives, pursuing familiar goals -- steady jobs, good friends, children of their own. All of this is threatened by something they can neither prevent nor control, making their story intensely moving and entirely unforgettable.</p>",

    "description": "William Gay established himself as \"the big new name to include in the storied annals of Southern Lit\" (<i>Esquire</i>) with his debut novel, <i>The Long Home</i>, and his highly acclaimed follow-up, <i>Provinces of Night</i>. Like Faulkner's Mississippi and Cormac McCarthy's American West, Gay's Tennessee is redolent of broken souls. Mining that same fertile soil, his debut collection, <i>I Hate to See That Evening Sun Go Down</i>, brings together thirteen stories charting the pathos of interior lives. Among the colorful people readers meet are: old man Meecham, who escapes from his nursing home only to find his son has rented their homestead to \"white trash\"; Quincy Nell Qualls, who not only falls in love with the town lothario but, pregnant, faces an inescapable end when he abandons her; Finis and Doneita Beasley, whose forty-year marriage is broken up by a dead dog; and Bobby Pettijohn -- awakened in the night by a search party after a body is discovered in his back woods. <br /> William Gay expertly sets these conflicted characters against lush backcountry scenery and defies our moral logic as we grow to love them for the weight of their human errors.",

    "description": "Ruth Patchett never thought of herself as particularly devilish. Rather the opposite in fact -- simply a tall, not terribly attractive woman living a quiet life as a wife and mother in a respectable suburb. But when she discovers that her husband is having a passionate affair with the lovely romantic novelist Mary Fisher, she is so seized by envy that she becomes truly diabolic. Within weeks she has burnt down the family home, collected the insurance, made love to the local drunk and embarked on a course of destruction and revenge. A blackly comic satire of the war of the sexes, LIFE AND LOVES OF A SHE DEVIL is the fantasy of the wronged woman made real.",

The lyrical writing and bold sweep of the story as Rose travels north will cast a spell over every reader. \"A rich tapestry that will resonate with readers...The stuff of epic tale-telling, replete with high drama and compelling characterisations.\" - Booklist. <br /><br />Rose was born into the world facing north, and as a north child, superstition says that she will be a wanderer, traveling far from home. This prophecy is fulfilled when she is taken on the back of a white bear to a mysterious empty castle, where a silent stranger appears to her night after night. When her curiosity overcomes her, she loses her heart, and must journey to a land east of the sun and west of the moon to reclaim it.",

Now the tales he could not tell, the secrets he could not reveal explode in <i>Rogue Warrior II: Red Cell</i> -- a riveting ne novel with Marcinko himself as the hero.</blockquote>\n</b>He is the enemy's worst nightmare and lives by only one rule. . . win, by any means.<p>Freelance security consultant Dick Marcinko is playing terrorist at Tokyo's Narita Airport. Easily penetrating the facility's defenses, he engages in a deadly firefight with North Korean operatives -- and discovers that a group of traitorous Americans are smuggling nuclear materials to North Korea and Japan. With no where else to turn, the former Secretary of Defense recalls Marcinko to the Navy against his will to command Red Cell, a dirty-dozen Seal team Marcinko created. From infiltrating Washington's Navy Yard offices and secret nuclear weapons depot in California, to raiding a North Korean Navy base and a target far out in the Pacific, the Rogue Warrior and his marauding SEALs fight incredible odds and increasingly dangerous enemies. A relentlessly paced audio program that hurtles to its electifying climax, <i>Rogue Warrior II: Red Cell</i> is as good as a thriller gets.</p>",

Suddenly, the most extraordinary man appears. It is Nicholas Stafford, Earl of Thornwyck\u2026and according to his tombstone he died in 1564!<br /><br />Drawn to his side by a bond so sudden and compelling it overshadows reason, Dougless knows that Nicholas is nothing less than a miracle: a man who does not seek to change her, who finds her perfect, fascinating, just as she is.

    "description": "In a digital laboratory on the shores of Puget Sound, a band of virtual reality researchers race to complete the Cavern, an empty white room that can become a jungle, a painting, or a vast Byzantine cathedral. In a war-torn Mediterranean city, an American is held hostage, chained to a radiator in another empty white room. What can possibly join two such remote places? Only the shared imagination, a room that these people unwittingly build in common, where they are all about to meet, where the dual frames of this inventive novel to coalesce.<br /><br />Adie Klarpol, a skilled but disillusioned artist, comes back to life, revived by the thrill of working with the Cavern\u2019s cutting-edge technology. Against the collapse of Cold War empires and the fall of the Berlin Wall, she retreats dangerously into the cyber-realities she has been hired to create. As her ex-husband lies dying and the outbreak of computerized war fills her with a sense of guilty complicity, Adie is thrown deeper into building a place of beauty and unknown power, were she might fend off the incursions of the real world gone wrong.<br /><br />On the other side of the globe, Taimur Martin, an English teacher retreating from a failed love affair, is picked up off the streets in Beirut by Islamic fundamentalists and held in solitary captivity. Without distraction or hope of release, he must keep himself whole by the force of his memory alone. Each infinite, empty day moves him closer to insanity, and only the surprising arrival of sanctuary sustains him for the shattering conclusion. <em>Plowing the Dark</em> is fiction that explores the imagination\u2019s power to both destroy and save.",

    "description": "Christmas 1951, Los Angeles: a city where the police are as corrupt as the criminals. Six prisoners are beaten senseless in their cells by cops crazed on alcohol. For the three LAPD detectives involved, it will expose the guilty secrets on which they have built their corrupt and violent careers. The novel takes these cops on a sprawling epic of brutal violence and the murderous seedy side of Hollywood. One of the best crime novels ever written, it is the heart of Ellroy's four-novel masterpiece, the LA Quartet, and an example of crime writing at its most powerful.",

    "description": "Two Undaunted Men Frank Wells was the head of a major motion picture studio. Dick Bass had made his fortune as an energy and resort entrepreneur. In middle age, both men left behind home, family, and successful careers to share an impossible dream. Seven Unconquered Summits The challenge: be the first to climb the highest mountain on each of seven continents, from McKinley to Kilimanjaro to Everest. The obstacles: many and merciless, from ice storms to illness to a measurement question that threatened to make their record-breaking expedition a sham. The prize: the sheer, exhilarating triumph of standing at the top of every continent on earth.",

    "description": "Lucien is seriously ill but his life is transformed when an old Italian notebook gives him the power to become a stravagante, a time traveller with access to 16th century Italy. He wakes up in Bellezza (Venice) during carnival time and meets Arianna, a girl his own age who is disguised as a boy in the hope of being selected as one of the Duchessa's mandoliers. Arianna gives Lucien her boy's clothing and he is selected as a mandolier himself, becoming a friend of fellow-stravagante Rodolfo, the Duchessa's lover, and saving the Duchessa's life when she is threatened by an assassin hired by the powerful di Chimici family. For state occasions the Duchessa uses her maid Giuliana as a body-double but Guiliana commits the fatal mistake of revealing the secret to her fiance Enrico and a sequence of devastating consequences unravels. Meanwhile Lucien has met the original stravagante, the Elizabethan alchemist William Dethridge, and he begins to understand that he may be called to follow in his footsteps.",

    "description": "'We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold. I remember saying something like, \"I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive ...\"' Hunter S. Thompson is roaring down the desert highway to Las Vegas with his attorney, the Samoan, to find the dark side of the American Dream. Armed with a drug arsenal of stupendous proportions, the duo engage in a surreal succession of chemically enhanced confrontations with casino operators, police officers and assorted Middle Americans. This stylish reissue of Hunter S. Thompson's iconic masterpiece, a controversial bestseller when it appeared in 1971, features the brilliant Ralph Steadman illustrations of the original. It brings to a new generation the hallucinatory humour and nightmare terror of Hunter S. Thompson's musings on the collapse of the American Dream.",

    "description": "Winner of 2006 The Society of Midland Authors Adult Fiction Award<br /><br /> \tChildren who anesthetize--and dress up--small wild animals in an ill-fated attempt to cheer their grieving mother; childhood friends who ritually return every year to the site of their near-kidnapping; an awkward teen trying to find his place among the cultural ruins of Greek Mythology Camp; brothers brought together, if not by mutual understanding, by a strange need to steal airport baggage: these are some of the characters who inhabit--and invariably tell--the stories in Joe Meno's <i>Bluebirds Used to Croon in the Choir</i>. Oddballs and charmers and would-be lovers, they are souls not so much lost as wandering, looking for something better, almost getting laid, trying to explain or, if all else fails, to entertain--and this they unfailingly do. Rarely has fiction so understated produced such hilarity and heartbreak.<br /><br /> \tNovelist, music journalist, and playwright Meno writes squarely in the American tradition of wringing large effects from small change, revealing the subtlety in the broad stroke, and conveying complexity with seeming simplicity. Celebrated for its \"unflinching honesty\" (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>) and for its \"poetic and visceral style\" (<i>Booklist</i>), his work resonates with the unmistakable magic and curious mystery of modern life.",

    "description": "When Dorothy triumphed over the Wicked Witch of the West in L. Frank Baum's classic tale we heard only her side of the story. But what about her arch-nemesis, the mysterious Witch? Where did she come from? How did she become so wicked? And what is the true nature of evil?<br /><br />Gregory Maguire creates a fantasy world so rich and vivid that we will never look at Oz the same way again. <i>Wicked</i> is about a land where animals talk and strive to be treated like first-class citizens, Munchkinlanders seek the comfort of middle-class stability, and the Tin Man becomes a victim of domestic violence. And then there is the little green-skinned girl named Elphaba, who will grow up to become the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, a smart, prickly, and misunderstood creature who challenges all our preconceived notions about the nature of good and evil.<br /><br />An astonishingly rich re-creation of the land of Oz, this book retells the story of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, who wasn't so wicked after all. Taking readers past the yellow brick road and into a phantasmagoric world rich with imagination and allegory, Gregory Maguire just might change the reputation of one of the most sinister characters in literature.",

    "description": "In Michigan's Upper Peninsula, a dangerous rescue effort draws the ears and eyes of the entire country. A two-and-a-half-year-old girl has fallen down a mine shaft--\"the only sound is an astonished tiny intake of breath from Ursula as she goes down, like a penny into the slot of a bank, disappeared, gone.\" It is as if all hope for life on the planet is bound up in the rescue of this little girl, the first and only child of a young woman of Finnish extraction and her Chinese-American husband. One TV viewer following the action notes that the Wong family lives in a decrepit mobile home and wonders why all this time and money is being \"wasted on that half-breed trailer-trash kid.\" In response, the novel takes a breathtaking leap back in time to visit Ursula's most remarkable ancestors: a third-century-B.C. Chinese alchemist; an orphaned playmate of a seventeenth-century Swedish queen; Professor Alabaster Wong, a Chautauqua troupe lecturer (on exotic Chinese topics) traveling the Midwest at the end of the nineteenth century; her great-great-grandfather Jake Maki, who died at twenty-nine in a Michigan iron mine cave-in; and others whose richness and history are contained in the induplicable DNA of just one person--little Ursula Wong.<br /><br />Ursula's story echoes those of her ancestors, many of whom so narrowly escaped not being born that her very existence--like ours--comes to seem a miracle. Ambitious and accomplished, <b>Ursula, Under</b> is, most of all, wonderfully entertaining--a daring saga of culture, history, and heredity.",

He\u2019s very sick, and watching his condition deteriorate as the summer passes is almost more than Vicky can bear. To complicate matters, she finds herself as the center of attention for three very different boys.<br /><br />Zachary Grey, the troubled and reckless boy Vicky met last summer, wants her all to himself as he grieves the loss of his mother. Leo Rodney has been just a friend for years, but the tragic loss of his father causes him to turn to Vicky for comfort\u2014and romance. And then there\u2019s Adam Eddington. Adam is only asking Vicky to help with his research on dolphins. But Adam\u2014and the dolphins\u2014may just be what Vicky needs to get through this heartbreaking summer.",

    "description": "Fathers and Sons (1862) is regarded as one of the major works of 19th-century fiction. The novel was the most closely studied of Ivan Sergeevich Turgenev's works in the Soviet high school curriculum. The novel seemed a perfect vehicle for portraying the brewing unrest of the pre-revolutionary era and introduced the character of Bazarov -- the spirited nihilist who was seen as a brilliant idealistic rebel, the new kind of perfect man who rejected the old notions of class and came to disrupt nobility's status quo. Growing up, Turgenev witnessed much class injustice in Russia, and his themes reflect his overwhelming concern with the suffering of the poor and the voiceless serfs. But FATHERS AND SONS is not merely a convenient socio-political piece; Turgenev is a lyrical romantic. At the novel's heart lies the ultimately tragic human story of Bazarov's flippant kiss of a servant girl and the bizarre tension it causes in a cozy country gentry household where he is a guest.",

How? By speaking Yiddish, employing terms that convey an <em>attitude</em>--part plucky self-assertion, part ironic fatalism. When Dick <em>schmoozes</em>, when Jane <em>kvetches</em>, when their children <em>fress</em> noodles at a Chinese restaurant, the clash of cultures produces genuine hilarity.",

    "description": "Together for the first time in one paperback volume are two of Jung's major late works, in the version published in The Collected Works of C. G. Jung, as rendered by Jung's official translator. \"The Undiscovered Self\" (1957) integrates many of Jung's lifelong social and psychological concerns and addresses the uneasy relation between the individual and mass society. The survival of civilization, he maintains, depends on individual awareness of both the conscious and unconscious aspects of the human psyche. The exploration of the unconscious, in particular, leads to self-knowledge and with it recognition of the duality of human natureits potential for evil as well as for good. Jung believes that it is this self-knowledge that enables the individual to resist the collective power of mass society and the state and to cope with their possible threats. Jung's reflections on self-knowledge and the exploration of the unconscious carry over into his essay \"Symbols and the Interpretation of Dreams, \" completed shortly before his death in 1961. (It is the original version of his introduction to the symposium Man and His Symbols, conceived as a popular presentation of Jungian ideas.) Describing dreams as communications from the unconscious--as expressions of aspects of the individual that have been neglected or unrealized--Jung explains how the symbols that occur in dreams compensate for repressed emotions and intuitions. In a world dehumanized, in Jung's view, by scientific \"progress\" and the loss of emotional participation in natural events, symbols recall our original nature, its instincts and peculiar way of thinking. This essay brings together Jung's fully evolved thoughts on the analysis ofdreams and the healing of the rift between consciousness and the unconscious, in the context of his system of psychology.",

But when offered the chance to be young again by participating in a top-secret experiment called Project Turnabout, they agreed. Miraculously, the experiment worked -- Melly and Anny Beth were actually growing younger every year. But when they learned that the final treatment would be deadly, they ran for their lives. <br /><br /> Now it is 2085. Melly and Anny Beth are teenagers. They have no idea what will happen when they hit age zero, but they do know they will soon be too young to take care of themselves. They need to find someone to help them before time runs out, once and for all....",

Back then Specials were a sinister rumor -- frighteningly beautiful, dangerously strong, breathtakingly fast. Ordinary pretties might live their whole lives without meeting a Special. But Tally's never been ordinary.<br /><br />And now she's been turned into one of them: a superamped fighting machine, engineered to keep the uglies down and the pretties stupid.<br /><br />The strength, the speed, and the clarity and focus of her thinking feel better than anything Tally can remember. Most of the time. One tiny corner of her heart still remembers something more.<br /><br />Still, it's easy to tune that out -- until Tally's offered a chance to stamp out the rebels of the New Smoke permanently. It all comes down to one last choice: listen to that tiny, faint heartbeat, or carry out the mission she's programmed to complete. Either way, Tally's world will never be the same.",

    "description": "In a Sin City short story, \"The Babe Wore Red,\" Frank Miller deviated from his stark black-and-white artwork by adding tiny bits of color throughout the story. The girl's dress was red, her lips were red--you get the picture. In <i>That Yellow Bastard</i>, the fourth Sin City graphic novel, Miller's experiment with yellow ink is also a tremendous success. The setup is simple. On the last day before he retires, Hartigan, an old cop, gets a call about an 11-year-old girl who has been kidnapped by a lunatic. Hartigan has got just one more thing to do before he retires: save the girl. Saving her is the easy part, because Hartigan has uncovered something really bad that is not going to stop until it catches up with him. <i>That Yellow Bastard</i> is nerve-racking to the very end.",

When Arthur Bobowicz is sent out to bring home the family's Thanksgiving turkey, he returns instead with Henrietta -- a 266-pound chicken with a mind of her own. Thus begins the hilarious chain of events that has kept readers in stitches since Henrietta first pecked her way onto the scene in 1977. Revised and with brand-new art by Jill Pinkwater, this new edition of \"The Hoboken Chicken Emergency\" is sure to delight chicken-lovers of all ages.",

    "description": "<br /><div><i>The Best of James Herriot</i> is one of the most extraordinary volumes ever devoted to the work and world of a contemporary writer. Within its covers are unforgettable episodes from the remarkable series of memoirs that began with <i>All Creatures Great and Small</i>-\"the ones my family and I have laughed at over the years and the ones my readers have said they most enjoyed,\" as Herriot, himself, put it. Yet the book is far more than a simple anthology: Its gorgeous pages also include hundreds of line drawings and color photographs, capturing Herriot's Yorkshire in a worthy complement to the writer's words.<br /><br />The 1991 publication of <i>Every Living Thing</i>, rendered the original edition of this book incomplete. This fall will mark the publication of the complete, definitive edition with the addition of five of his best, more recent stories, as well as new art. Once again <i>The Best of James Herriot</i> becomes the quintessential Herriot volume-one of those invaluable books that will be loved as much in decades to come as it is today.<br /></div><br />",

    "description": "Called by its author a false novel, Dark Back of Time begins with the tale of the odd effects of publishing All Souls, his witty and sardonic 1989 Oxford novel. All Souls is a book Marias swears to be fiction, but which its characters--the real-life dons and professors and bookshop owners who have recognized themselves--fiercely maintain to be a roman a clef. With the sleepy world of Oxford set into fretful motion by a world that never existed, Dark Back of Time begins an odyssey into the nature of identity (we do not know anyone entirely, not even ourselves) and of time. Marias deftly weaves together autobiography (the brother who died as a child; the loss of his mother), a legendary kingdom, strange ghostly literary figures, halls of mirrors, a one-eyed pilot, a curse in Havana, and a bullet lost in Mexico. Dark Back of Time has been acclaimed here as superb (Review of Contemporary Fiction), fantastically original (Talk), brilliant (Virginia Quarterly Review), and a rare gift (The New York Times Book Review). In the best manner of Borges, The Hudson Review commented that this hybrid is lush and mysterious.",

    "description": "Tens of millions of Americans, from Generation X-ers to baby boomers and beyond, are rediscovering libertarianism, a visionary alternative to the tired party orthodoxies of left and right. In 1995 a Gallup poll found that 52 percent of Americans said \"the federal government has become so large and powerful that it poses an immediate threat to the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens.\" Later that year, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> concurred, saying: \"Because of their growing disdain for government, more and more Americans appear to be drifting\u2014often unwittingly\u2014toward a libertarian philosophy.\" <br /> Libertarianism is hardly new, but its framework for liberty under law and economic progress makes it especially suited for the dynamic new era we are now entering. In the United States, the bureaucratic leviathan is newly threatened by a resurgence of the libertarian ideas upon which the country was founded. We are witnessing a breakdown of all the cherished beliefs of the welfare-warfare state. Americans have seen the failure of big government. Now, in the 1990s, we are ready to apply the lessons of this century to make the next one the century not of the state but of the free individual. <br /> David Boaz presents the essential guidebook to the libertarian perspective, detailing its roots, central tenets, solutions to contemporary policy dilemmas, and future in American politics. He confronts head-on the tough questions frequently posed to libertarians: What about inequality? Who protects the environment? What ties people together if they are essentially self-interested? A concluding section, \"Are You a Libertarian?\" gives readers a chance to explore the substance of their own beliefs. <i>Libertarianism</i> is must reading for understanding one of the most exciting and hopeful movements of our time.",

Have you ever thought that the whole universe might be a crazy, mixed-up dream? If you have, then you've had hints of the Change War.<br /><br />It's been going on for a billion years and it will last another billion or so. Up and down the timeline, the two sides--\"Spiders\" and \"Snakes\"--battle endlessly to change the future and the past. Our lives, our memories, are their battleground. And in the midst of the war is the Place, outside space and time, where Greta Forzane and the other Entertainers provide solace and r-&amp;-r for tired time warriors.",

    "description": "In 1957, a children's book called <i>The Lonely Doll</i> was published. With its pink-and-white-checked cover and photographs featuring a wide-eyed doll, it captured the imaginations of young girls and made the author, Dare Wright, a household name. Close to forty years after its publication, the book was out of print but not forgotten. When the cover image inexplicably came to journalist Jean Nathan one afternoon, she went in search of the book--and ultimately its author. Nathan found Dare Wright living out her last days in a decrepit public hospital in Queens, New York. Over the next five years, Nathan pieced together Dare Wright's bizarre life of glamour and painful isolation to create this mesmerizing biography of a woman who struggled to escape the imprisonment of her childhood through her art.",

    "description": "<i>\u201cIn the fall, I went for walks and brought home bones. The best bones weren\u2019t on trails\u2014deer and moose don\u2019t die conveniently\u2014and soon I was wandering so far into the woods that I needed a map and compass to find my way home. When winter came and snow blew into the mountains, burying the bones, I continued to spend my days and often my nights in the woods. I vaguely understood that I was doing this because I could no longer think; I found relief in walking up hills. When the night temperatures dropped below zero, I felt visited by necessity, a baseline purpose, and I walked for miles, my only objective to remain upright, keep moving, preserve warmth. When I was lost, I told myself stories . . .\u201d</i><br /><br />So Charles D\u2019Ambrosio recounted his life in Philipsburg, Montana, the genesis of the brilliant stories collected here, six of which originally appeared in The New Yorker. Each of these eight burnished, terrifying, masterfully crafted stories is set against a landscape that is both deeply American and unmistakably universal. A son confronts his father\u2019s madness and his own hunger for connection on a misguided hike in the Pacific Northwest. A screenwriter fights for his sanity in the bleak corridors of a Manhattan psych ward while lusting after a ballerina who sets herself ablaze. A Thanksgiving hunting trip in Northern Michigan becomes the scene of a haunting reckoning with marital infidelity and desperation. And in the magnificent title story, carpenters building sets for a porn movie drift dreamily beneath a surface of sexual tension toward a racial violence they will never fully comprehend. Taking place in remote cabins, asylums, Indian reservations, the backloads of Iowa and the streets of Seattle, this collection of stories, as muscular and challenging as the best novels, is about people who have been orphaned, who have lost connection, and who have exhausted the ability to generate meaning in their lives. Yet in the midst of lacerating difficulty, the sensibility at work in these fictions boldly insists on the enduring power of love. D\u2019Ambrosio conjures a world that is fearfully inhospitable, darkly humorous, and touched by glory; here are characters, tested by every kind of failure, who struggle to remain human, whose lives have been sharpened rather than numbed by adversity, whose apprehension of truth and beauty has been deepened rather than defeated by their troubles. Many writers speak of the abyss. Charles D\u2019Ambrosio writes as if he is inside of it, gazing upward, and the gaze itself is redemptive, a great yearning ache, poignant and wondrous, equal parts grit and grace.",

It was published pseudonymously, even though Evans was a well-published and highly respected scholar of her time. <br />The story's plot follows four characters' rural lives in the fictional community of Hayslope\u2014a rural, pastoral and close-knit community in 1799. The novel revolves around a love triangle between beautiful but self-absorbed Hetty Sorrel, Captain Arthur Donnithorne, the young squire who seduces her, Adam Bede, her unacknowledged suitor, and Dinah Morris, Hetty's cousin, a fervent, virtuous and beautiful Methodist lay preacher.",

    "description": "One of America\u2019s premier writers, the bestselling author of <b>Ragtime, Billy Bathgate, The Book of Daniel, </b>and<b> World\u2019s Fair </b>turns his astonishing narrative powers to the short story in five dazzling explorations of who we are as a people and how we live.<br /><br />Ranging over the American continent from Alaska to Washington, D.C., these superb short works are crafted with all the weight and resonance of the novels for which E. L. Doctorow is famous. You will find yourself set down in a mysterious redbrick townhouse in rural Illinois (\u201cA House on the Plains\u201d), working things out with a baby-kidnapping couple in California (\u201cBaby Wilson\u201d), living on a religious-cult commune in Kansas (\u201cWalter John Harmon\u201d), and sharing the heartrending cross-country journey of a young woman navigating her way through three bad marriages to a kind of bruised but resolute independence (\u201cJolene: A Life\u201d). And in the stunning \u201cChild, Dead, in the Rose Garden,\u201d you will witness a special agent of the FBI finding himself at a personal crossroads while investigating a grave breach of White House security. <br /><br />Two of these stories have already won awards as the best fiction of the year published in American periodicals, and two have been chosen for annual best-story anthologies. <br />Composed in a variety of moods and voices, these remarkable portrayals of the American spiritual landscape show a modern master at the height of his powers.",

    "description": "Winner of the 2008 National Parenting Publications Awards (NAPPA) in the Children's Products competition. A memorable trio of characters, each fighting for independence<br />Eleven-year-old Toby Steiner wants to do normal things on his vacation: he wants to hike and race his bike down the hill and learn to fish out on the lake. The last thing he wants is to return to the children's hospital where his painful cancer treatment finally ended. When Toby starts spending time with Pearl, a spunky old woman who lives on a nearby farm, and Blossom, her broken-down cow, he sees all the more reason to keep the new lump on his side a secret from his parents. From Pearl he discovers the beauty of poetry, and from Blossom he just might uncover the meaning of life.<br />In this honest and life-affirming novel for young readers, which Suzanne Fisher Staples, author of the Newbery Honor Book \"Shabanu, \"calls \"beautiful and gripping,\" an unforgettable boy learns about the importance of letting things happen on their own and listening to his heart.",

    "description": "Letters from the Earth is one of Mark Twain's posthumously published works. The essays were written during a difficult time in Twain's life; he was deep in debt and had lost his wife and one of his daughters. The book consists of a series of short stories, many of which deal with God and Christianity. Twain penned a series of letters from the point-of-view of a dejected angel on Earth. This title story consists of letters written by the archangel Satan to archangels, Gabriel and Michael, about his observations on the curious proceedings of earthly life and the nature of man's religions. By analyzing the idea of heaven and God that is widely accepted by those who believe in both, Twain is able to take the silliness that is present and study it with the common sense that is absent. Not so much an attack as much as a cold dissection. Other short stories in the book include a bedtime story about a family of cats Twain wrote for his daughters, and an essay explaining why an anaconda is morally superior to Man. Twain's writings in Letters From the Earth find him at perhaps his most quizzical and questioning state ever.",

    "description": "Before WATCHMEN, Alan Moore made his debut in the U.S. comic book industry with the revitalization of the horror comic book THE SWAMP THING. His deconstruction of the classic monster stretched the creative boundaries of the medium and became one of the most spectacular series in comic book history.<p>With modern-day issues explored against a backdrop of horror, SWAMP THING's stories became commentaries on environmental, political and social issues, unflinching in their relevance. SAGA OF THE SWAMP THING Book One collects issues #20-27 of this seminal series including the never-before-reprinted SAGA OF THE SWAMP THING #20, where Moore takes over as writer and concludes the previous storyline.</p><p>Book One begins with the story \"The Anatomy Lesson,\" a haunting origin story that reshapes SWAMP THING mythology with terrifying revelations that begin a journey of discovery and adventure that will take him across the stars and beyond.</p>",

The modern comics landscape has been changed by the Vertigo line of books--an imprint that traces its roots back to this version of <i>Swamp Thing.</i> By taking a horror character fully entrenched in a superhero world (as silly as that might seem), this creative team put a new face on horror comics and on horror in general. <i>Swamp Thing: Love and Death</i> is the second collection of the team's work on the series, presented here in full color. Don't let the mediocre <i>Swamp Thing</i> movies fool you, this book is filled with sophisticated suspense and terror.",

    "description": "According to science-fiction writer Kilgore Trout, a global timequake will occur in New York City on 13th February 2001. It is the moment when the universe suffers a crisis of conscience. Should it expand or make a great big bang? It decides to wind the clock back a decade to 1991, making everyone in the world endure ten years of deja-vu and a total loss of free will - not to mention the torture of reliving every nanosecond of one of the tawdiest and most hollow decades. With his trademark wicked wit, Vonnegut addresses memory, suicide, the Great Depression, the loss of American eloquence, and the obsolescent thrill of reading books.",

It is a breathless roller-coaster ride of a movie that keeps springing one bizarre surprise after another, sustaining suspense with dazzling audacity. The unsuspecting audience is lured into a psychological and moral thicket of troubling implications, which bear the unmistakable imprint of Mamet\u2019s intensely personal vision.<br /><br />Here is the complete screenplay of House of Games, with many illustrations selected from the film and an introduction by the author recounting in candid detail his experience as a first-time director.",

But do John and Margaret's power struggles hide deeper feelings? And, when it seems Margaret has lost everything, can she find the one thing she never expected?",

She lives in the Theater Royal on Drury Lane, a place filled with dramatic characters, theatrical spectacles, and now, a secret treasure--which Cat has been asked to protect. Her new friend Pedro, a former slave and gifted violinist, is eager to help, and so is the theater prompter, Jonathan, who is hiding secrets of his own. But when the ruthless gang leader Billy Shepherd learns about the treasure, Cat thinks she's going to lose it for sure. She still doesn't know what the treasure is, so how can she keep it safe from Billy and his gang? Follow Cat into the streets of London, as she faces danger and adventure, racing to be the first to discover the diamond of Drury Lane!",

    "description": "\"There are moments when I suddenly realize that I'm a nice boy from Iowa who is entirely comfortable sitting in a room of freaks.\" <br />So begins Patrick Moore's unforgettable account of life as a crystal meth addict--a \"tweaker.\" Like a wild ride down Alice's rabbit hole with a guide who is darkly funny and heartbreakingly honest, \"Tweaked \"chronicles a twenty-year trip that stretches from Moore's lonely childhood in Iowa with his grandmother, Zelma--an alcoholic artist who, when loaded, turns frozen food into crafts projects --to the day he sits, naked, in a Los Angeles rental, hallucinating about psycho-robbers while talking to a possum he's sure is God. Along the way, there are acid trips at the V.F.W., Dexetrim study halls with his Bad Girl Posse in the seventies, teeth-grinding nights of dancing and anonymous sex in New York City's hottest eighties clubs, taking pictures of Andy Warhol, losing friends and lovers, and navigating a Byzantine underworld of cookers, users, club kids, dealers, and colorful characters as intense as the drug itself. There is Lee, the glamorous, outre bad boy with a devastating wit and a taste for danger; Tony, the tweaker who likes to remove his eyebrows; Ding-Dong, the Depends-wearing, nearly blind housemate; Hisako, the artist and squatter with an impenetrable Japanese accent and a fondness for hot plate cooking; \"Mother\" Judy, the tough, butch rehab counselor who takes no prisoners, and countless others on the road from crystal meth hell to eventual sobriety. <br />Candid, gripping, and ultimately triumphant, \"Tweaked\" is that rarest of memoirs--a tale so vivid and personal in the telling it feels like fiction, but every word is true.",

    "description": "No metropolis has been more loved or more hated. To its official boosters, \u201cLos Angeles brings it all together.\u201d To detractors, LA is a sunlit mortuary where \u201cyou can rot without feeling it.\u201d To Mike Davis, the author of this fiercely elegant and wide- ranging work of social history, Los Angeles is both utopia and dystopia, a place where the last Joshua trees are being plowed under to make room for model communities in the desert, where the rich have hired their own police to fend off street gangs, as well as armed Beirut militias.\u00a0<br /><br />In\u00a0<i>City of Quartz</i>, Davis reconstructs LA\u2019s shadow history and dissects its ethereal economy. He tells us who has the power and how they hold on to it. He gives us a city of Dickensian extremes, Pynchonesque conspiracies, and a desperation straight out of Nathaniel Westa city in which we may glimpse our own future mirrored with terrifying clarity.<br /><br />In this new edition, Davis provides a dazzling update on the city\u2019s current status.",

Never fall in love. </i></b><br /><br />But every now and again a Dark-Hunter thinks himself above the Code. That's when I'm summoned. Who am I? I'm the one thing the fearless fear. Step over the line and it's my wrath you will face. Nothing can touch me. Nothing can sway me. I am relentless and unfeeling.<br /><br />Or so I thought until I met a female Dark-Hunter who goes by the name of Danger-it's not just her name, it's how she lives her life. She doesn't trust me at all. And who could blame her? She alone knows that I'm here to be judge, jury and most likely executioner of her friends. Yet she is my key to saving some of them. Without her, they all will die.<br /><br />Dangereuse St. Richard is a deadly distraction. Something about her is reawakening a heart I thought was long dead. But in a race against evil, the only hope mankind has is that I do my duty. And how can I do my duty when it means that I will have to sacrifice the only woman I've ever loved?</div>\n</div>",

We are Shadow.\n    \n    We are the Rulers of the Night.\n    \n    We, alone, stand between mankind and those who would see mankind destroyed. We are the Guardians.\n    \n    The Soulless Keepers.\n    \n    Our souls were cast out so that we would not forewarn the Daimons we pursue. By the time they see us coming, it\u2019s too late.\n    \n    The Daimons and Apollites know us. They fear us. We are death to all those who prey upon the humans.\n    \n    Neither Human, nor Apollite, we exist beyond the realm of the Living, beyond the realm of the Dead.\n    \n    We are the Dark-Hunters.\n    \n    And we are eternal.\n    \n    Yeah, yeah. Enough of the doom and gloom because, baby, that ain\u2019t us. You want to know what a Dark-Hunter is? We are what the intro says. We\u2019re Mad, Bad and Immortal. We\u2019re ancient warriors with attitudes who fight rough, and play hard.\n    \n    We are the scary things that go bump in the night. And we love every minute of it. So when you think you\u2019re being watched. You just might be. The question is\u2026is it something evil or is it one of us?",

    "description": "Harper Blaine was your average small-time PI until she died - for two minutes. Now she's a Greywalker - walking the thin line between the living world and the paranormal realm. And she's discovering that her new abilities are landing her all sorts of \"strange\" cases.<br /><br />In the days leading up to Halloween, Harper's been hired by a university research group that is attempting to create an artificial poltergeist. The head researcher suspects someone is faking the phenomena, but Harper's investigation reveals something else entirely - they've succeeded. And when one of the group's members is killed in a brutal and inexplicable fashion, Harper must determine whether the killer is the ghost itself, or someone all too human.",

A native Californian, Didion applies her scalpel-like intelligence to the state\u2019s ethic of ruthless self-sufficiency in order to examine that ethic\u2019s often tenuous relationship to reality.<br /><br />Combining history and reportage, memoir and literary criticism, <b>Where I Was From</b><i> </i>explores California\u2019s romances with land and water; its unacknowledged debts to railroads, aerospace, and big government; the disjunction between its code of individualism and its fetish for prisons. Whether she is writing about her pioneer ancestors or privileged sexual predators, robber barons or writers (not excluding herself), Didion is an unparalleled observer, and her book is at once intellectually provocative and deeply personal.",

    "description": "For the last four decades, Fidel Castro's communist Cuba has survived a harsh economic blockade. In 1993, Castro attempted economic reform by allowing Cubans to use U.S. dollars and begin their own business ventures\u2014\"a huge messy free-for-all.\" This time of confused, low-rent capitalism is the backdrop for Pedro Juan Gutierrez's gritty, powerful, and atmospheric novel-in-stories, <i>Dirty Havana Trilogy,</i> translated from the original Spanish version by Natasha Wimmer.<br /><br />Gutierrez, whose prose sings of grime and simple, hard-clay truths, much like the words of <a href=\"http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?author_last=Diaz&amp;author_first=Junot&amp;match=exact&amp;options=and\" rel=\"nofollow\">Junot D\u00edaz</a>, is a well-known member of the Latin American visual poetry movement and a magazine journalist living in Havana. <i>Dirty Havana Trilogy</i> is written from the semiautobiographical point of view of Pedro Juan, a 40-year-old sex-starved ex-radio journalist cobbling together an existence by selling everything from himself to drugs to whatever he can get his hands on. \"Everything's worth something here,\" he writes.<br /><br />Pedro Juan is an ex-radio journalist because in a \"model\" communist society nothing bad is acceptable news. Through his tormented lead character, Gutierrez provides a window into his reasons for writing such a crude book. \"That's why I was disillusioned with journalism and why I started to write raw stories.... I write to jar people a little and force others to wake up and smell the shit.... That's how I terrorize cowards and mess with people who like to muzzle those of us who speak up.... My stories could run bare-assed out into the middle of the street, shouting, 'Freedom, freedom, freedom.'\"<br /><br />That said, be warned: <i>Dirty Havana Trilogy</i> is not for the faint of heart. It is raw, squarely confronting poverty, racism, violence, prostitution, and the lengths Cubans go to in order to secure the almighty buck. In one story, the man who lives across the hall from Pedro Juan, in the crumbling apartment building that serves as the focal point for much of the book, is busted by the cops for stealing human livers from the morgue and selling them on the streets as pork livers.<br /><br />But survival isn't the only thing on the minds of Gutierrez's colorful characters. Oddly enough, it's the quest for release, for fits of pleasure, for some sliver of happiness no matter how warped the avenue may seem to the world outside Havana. And that quest is manifested in the hard-core sex that permeates the pages of the book. An orgasm is one of the few pleasures no one can be denied. As violent and nauseating as the sex -- and the life -- may seem on the surface, Gutierrez achieves the difficult task of lifting his characters from the muck, giving his <i>Dirty Havana Trilogy</i> an intellectual and emotional depth that far outweighs the carnal.<br /><br />Near the end Gutierrez writes, \"Born in the ruins, they just kept trying not to give up or let themselves be beaten so severely that at last they were forced to surrender. Anything was possible, everything allowed, except defeat.\" The book then becomes a manifesto, a well-wrought fight against literary persecution, a release the same as an orgasm, where the truth behind every dark corner, behind every door, must be told. <i>Dirty Havana Trilogy</i> comes from the same womb in which literature was born, a book that just may someday be held up beside those of the mighty dead.<br /><br /><i>Nelson Taylor is a freelance writer and author of the travel guide</i> America Bizarro, <i>published by St. Martin's Press.</i>",

    "description": "Everyone in the small town of Central City, Texas loves Lou Ford. A deputy sheriff, Lou's known to the small-time criminals, the real-estate entrepreneurs, and all of his coworkers--the low-lifes, the big-timers, and everyone in-between--as the nicest guy around. He may not be the brightest or the most interesting man in town, but nevertheless, he's the kind of officer you're happy to have keeping your streets safe. The sort of man you might even wish your daughter would end up with someday.<br /><br />But behind the platitudes and glad-handing lurks a monster the likes of which few have seen. An urge that has already claimed multiple lives, and cost Lou his brother Mike, a self-sacrificing construction worker who fell to his death on the job in what was anything but an accident. A murder that Lou is determined to avenge--and if innocent people have to die in the process, well, that's perfectly all right with him.<br /><br />In <i>The Killer Inside Me</i>, Thompson goes where few novelists have dared to go, giving us a pitch-black glimpse into the mind of the American Serial Killer years before Charles Manson, John Wayne Gacy, and Brett Easton Ellis's <i>American Psycho</i>, in the novel that will forever be known as the master performance of one of the greatest crime novelists of all time.",

Cath is scatterbrained, messy, and\u2013since she had her heart broken a few years back\u2013emotionally closed off. Si is impossibly tidy, bitchy, and desperate for a man of his own. They live in London\u2019s West Hampstead along with their lifelong friends, Josh and Lucy, who are happily married with a devil-spawn child and a terrifying Swedish nanny, Ingrid.<br /><br />All\u2019s well (sort of) until the sudden arrival of a college friend\u2013the stunningly beautiful Portia, who\u2019s known for breaking hearts. Though they\u2019ve grown up and grown apart from Portia, the four friends welcome her back into the fold. But does Portia have a hidden agenda or is she merely looking to reconnect with old friends? Her reappearance soon unleashes a rollicking series of events that tests the foursome\u2019s friendships to the limit and leaves them wondering if a happy ending is in store.<br /><br />Fortunately, Cath has plenty to take her mind off Portia\u2019s schemes\u2013like her gutsy decision to leave her job in advertising to fulfill her dream of opening a bookstore. And then there\u2019s James, the sexy real-estate agent who keeps dropping by even after the bookstore deal is done. With his irresistible smile and boyish charm could he be the one to melt Cath\u2019s heart? <br /><br /><i>Told with Jane Green\u2019s captivating wit and flare, <i>Bookends</i> is above all a story about friendship\u2013its twists, turns and complications\u2013and how it weathers the challenges of love, ambition, marriage, and, most of all, growing up. Warmhearted, sophisticated, and full of delicious surprises, <i>Bookends</i> is Green\u2019s most dazzling novel yet.</i>",

Unlike other books on getting organized, <i>It's Hard to Make a Difference When You Can't Find Your Keys</i> offers a clear seven-step path to personal development that is comprehensive in nature. <p> Drawing on her own experience as a chronically disorganized person, Paul adds warmth, insight, humor, and hope to this manual for change and self-discovery. She introduces the notion of becoming 'organized enough' to live a far more rewarding life and make the difference that is most important to you.</p>",

With profound beauty and insight, Bell addresses the truism that we can\u2019t talk about ourselves as sexual beings without asking who made us that way. For progressive Christians and readers who enjoy the writings of Donald Miller, N.T. Wrighter, Brian McLaren and Timothy Keller, Rob Bell is a pioneer among those seeking a new kind of Christian teaching.",

    "description": "<b>From the author of <i>The Dirty Girls Social Club</i> comes another fast, funny, soulful, and sexy novel about friendship and love amid Latinas.</b><br /><br />It's a jungle out there -- in Los Angeles, that is, where the tangle of freeways and ingrained insincerity can make a girl feel very alone, no matter how fabulous the weather or how cute the clothes at the South Coast Plaza mall. With very different styles and attitudes, Marcella, Olivia, and Alexis are trying to crack the code in L.A, trying to snare love and success. But first they have to come together\u2014to make their marks and plan the fun they're going to have along the way.<br /><br />Marcella is a hot, sharp young television actress who's barely able to enjoy the life she's bought for herself and certainly isn't enjoying her body, which is never quite perfect enough. Olivia, whose life revolves around her toddler son, Jack, is tethered to her suburban mommy track so tightly she can <i>almost</i> forget the horrible thing that happened to her family when she was a child herself. Alexis is a musicians' manager with a smart mouth, an ample body, and loads of style but barely enough self-esteem to fill a Prada card case. And the boys in their lives? Marcella's had about enough of them throwing themselves at her; Olivia's boy is her son; and Alexis is still searching, not for a boy this time, but for a man.<br /><br /><i>Playing with Boys</i> is a savvy novel with charm, style, and heart to spare.",

    "description": "When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks to save lives. But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: he can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over and the relationship starts to become truly intimate. When a raging storm hits his small Southern town, single mother Denise Holton\u2019s car skids off the road. The young mom is with her four-year-old son Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Taylor McAden finds her unconscious and bleeding, but does not find Kyle. When Denise wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone. During the search for Kyle, the connection between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. It will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love and will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. This rescue will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love.<br /><br /><br /><i>Did You Know?---<br /><br />The Rescue was the first novel by Nicholas Sparks to debut at # 1 on the New York Times bestseller List?<br /><br />In the process of writing this novel, Nicholas struggled with severe writer's block?<br /><br />The main character was named for the producer of the film versions of Message in a Bottle and A Walk to Remember?</i>",

Woody Allen on Woody Allen is a unique self-portrait of this uncompromising filmmaker that offers a revealing account of his life and work. In a series of rare, in-depth interviews, Allen brings us onto the sets and behind the scenes of all his films. Since its original publication, Woody Allen on Woody Allen has been the primary source of Allen's own thoughts on his work, childhood, favorite films, and inspirations. Now updated with one hundred pages of new material that brings us up to his Hollywood Ending, Woody Allen on Woody Allen is a required addition to any cinephile's library.",

Written for the New Yorker over a span of forty-nine years, they show White\u2019s changing concerns and development as a writer. In matchless style White writes about everything from cicadas to Khrushchev, from Thoreau to hyphens, from academic freedom to lipstick, from New York garbagemen to the sparrow, from Maine to the space age, from the Constitution to Harold Ross and even the common cold.<br /><br />White has been described by one critic as \u201cour finest essayist,\u201d and these short pieces and essays are classics to be read, savored, and read again. Also included are an Introduction and Selective Bibliography by Rebecca M. Dale.",

    "description": "The Pat Hobby Stories are a collection of 17 comedic short stories written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. They first appeared in Esquire magazine between January 1940 and May 1941, but in 1962 they were collected into a single book and published posthumously. Pat Hobby is a once successful screenwriter in Hollywood, but now an alcoholic and broke, who spends his time hanging around the studio, hoping for work. The stories generally revolve around him hatching a plan to earn money or glory in some way, but they usually end in further humiliation. The introduction to the book states, \"while it would be unfair to judge this book as a novel, it would be less than fair to consider it as anything but a full-length portrait. It was as such that Fitzgerald worked on it, and would have wanted it presented in book form, after its original magazine publication. He thought of it as a comedy.\"",

    "description": "Will she accept the offer before the clock strikes midnight?<br /><br />Sophie Beckett never dreamed she'd be able to sneak into Lady Bridgerton's famed masquerade ball. Though the daughter of an earl, Sophie has been relegated to the role of servant by her disdainful stepmother. But now, waltzing in the strong arms of the debonair and devastatingly handsome Benedict Bridgerton, she feels like royalty. Alas, she knows all enchantments must end when the clock strikes midnight.<br /><br /><em>Who was that extraordinary woman?</em> Ever since that magical night, a radiant vision in silver has blinded Benedict to the attractions of any other\u2014 except, perhaps, this alluring and oddly familiar beauty dressed in housemaid's garb. He has sworn to find and wed his mystery miss, but this breathtaking maid makes him weak with wanting her. If he offers her his heart, will he sacrifice his only chance for a fairy-tale love?",

    "description": "When it comes to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and depression, everything you believe is a lie.<br /><br />With research gleaned from the National Institutes of Health, T.S. Wiley and Bent Formby deliver staggering findings: Americans really are sick from being tired. Diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and depression are rising in our population. We\u2019re literally dying for a good night\u2019s sleep.<br /><br /> Our lifestyle wasn\u2019t always this way. It began with the invention of the lightbulb.<br /><br /> When we don\u2019t get enough sleep in sync with seasonal light exposure, we fundamentally alter a balance of nature that has been programmed into our physiology since day one. This delicate biological rhythm rules the hormones and neurotransmitters that determine appetite, fertility, and mental and physical health. When we rely on artificial light to extend our day until 11 p.m., midnight, and beyond, we fool our bodies into living in a perpetual state of summer. Anticipating the scarce food supply and forced inactivity of winter, our bodies begin storing fat and slowing metabolism to sustain us through the months of hibernation and hunger that never arrive. Our own survival instinct, honed over millennia, is now killing us.<br /><br /> Wiley and Formby also reveal:<br /> -That studies from our own government research prove the role of sleeplessness in diabetes, heart disease, cancer, infertility, mental illness, and premature aging<br /> -Why the carbohydrate-rich diets recommended by many health professionals are not only ridiculously ineffective but deadly<br /> -Why the lifesaving information that can turn things around is one of the best-kept secrets of our day.<br /><br /><i>Lights Out</i> is one wake-up call none of us can afford to miss.",

    "description": "This wonderful novel tells the story of seventeen-year-old Cassandra and her extraordinary family, who live in not-so-genteel poverty in a ramshackle old English castle. Cassandra's eccentric father is a writer whose first book took the literary world by storm but he has since failed to write a single word and now spends most of his time reading detective novels from the village library.<br /><br />Cassandra's elder sister, Rose - exquisitely beautiful, vain and bored - despairs of her family's circumstances and determines to marry their affluent American landlord, Simon regardless of the fact she does not love him. She is in turns helped and hindered in this by their bohemian step-mother Topaz, an artist's model and nudist who likes to commune with nature. Finally there is Stephen, dazzlingly handsome and hopelessly in love with Cassandra.<br /><br />Amidst this maelstrom Cassandra strives to hone her writing skills. She fills three notebooks with sharply funny yet poignant entries, which candidly chronicle the great changes that take place within the castle's walls, and her own first descent into love. By the time she pens her final entry, she has captured the heart of the reader in one of literature's most enchanting entertainments",

Cloud and Townsend unlock age-old keys to growth from Scripture to help people resolve issues of relationships, maturity, emotional problems, and overall spiritual growth. They shatter popular misconceptions about how God operates and show that growth is not about self-actualization, but about God\u2019s sanctification. In this theological foundation to their best-selling book Boundaries, they discuss:\u2022?What the essential processes are that make people grow\u2022?How those processes fit into a biblical understanding of spiritual growth and theology\u2022?How spiritual growth and real-life issues are one and the same\u2022?What the responsibilities are of pastors, counselors, and others who assist people in growing\u2014and what your own responsibilities are in your personal growth",

    "description": "When <i>The Fountainhead</i> was first published, Ayn Rand's daringly original literary vision and her groundbreaking philosophy, Objectivism, won immediate worldwide interest and acclaim. This instant classic is the story of an intransigent young architect, his violent battle against conventional standards, and his explosive love affair with a beautiful woman who struggles to defeat him. This edition contains a special afterword by Rand\u2019s literary executor, Leonard Peikoff, which includes excerpts from Ayn Rand\u2019s own notes on the making of <i>The Fountainhead</i>. As fresh today as it was then, here is a novel about a hero\u2014and about those who try to destroy him. <br />",

The protagonist of <i>Fences</i> (part of Wilson's ten-part Pittsburgh Cycle plays), Troy Maxson, is a strong man, a hard man. He has had to be to survive. Troy Maxson has gone through life in an America where to be proud and black is to face pressures that could crush a man, body and soul. But the 1950s are yielding to the new spirit of liberation in the 1960s, a spirit that is changing the world Troy Maxson has learned to deal with the only way he can, a spirit that is making him a stranger, angry and afraid, in a world he never knew and to a wife and son he understands less and less.",

    "description": "This collection of the timeless teachings of one of the greatest sages of India, Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, regarded by many as a \"modern spiritual classic\" is a testament to the uniqueness of the seer's life and work.<br /><br /><i>I Am That</i> preserves Maharaj's dialogues with the followers who came from around the world seeking his guidance in destroying false identities. The sage's sole concern was with human suffering and the ending of suffering. It was his mission to guide the individual to an understanding of his true nature and the timelessness of being. He taught that mind must recognize and penetrate its own state of being, \"being this or that, here or that, then or now,\" but just timeless being.",

And when she finds work as a governess in a mysterious mansion, it seems she has finally met her match with the darkly fascinating Mr Rochester. But Thornfield Hall contains a shameful secret - one that could keep Jane and Rochester apart forever. Can she choose between what is right, and her one chance of happiness?<br /><br />***One of the most widely-read and enjoyed of all Victorian novels, and one of the greatest tales of a woman's struggle for dignity and love in a hard time***<br /><br />Charlotte Bront\u00eb (1816-55) is the sister of Anne Bront\u00eb and Emily Bront\u00eb, author of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. <i>Jane Eyre</i> appeared in 1847 and was followed by <i>Shirley</i> (1848) and <i>Vilette</i> (1853). In 1854 Charlotte Bront\u00eb married her father's curate, Arthur Bell Nicholls. She died during her pregnancy on March 31, 1855 in Haworth, Yorkshire.",

    "description": "Television has conditioned us to tolerate visually entertaining material measured out in spoonfuls of time, to the detriment of rational public discourse and reasoned public affairs. In this eloquent, persuasive book, Neil Postman alerts us to the real and present dangers of this state of affairs, and offers compelling suggestions as to how to withstand the media onslaught. Before we hand over politics, education, religion, and journalism to the show business demands of the television age, we must recognize the ways in which the media shape our lives and the ways we can, in turn, shape them to serve out highest goals.",

Forty years ago, <i>Games People Play</i> revolutionized our understanding of what really goes on during basic social interactions. More than five million copies later, Dr. Eric Berne's classic is as astonishing &amp; revealing as it was on the day it was first published. <br /> We play games all the time: sexual games, marital games, power games with our bosses, &amp; competitive games with friends. Detailing status contests like \"Martini\"; (I know a better way), to lethal couples combat like \"If It Weren't For You\"; &amp; \"Uproar,\"; to flirtation favorites like \"The Stocking Game\"; &amp; \"Let's You &amp; Him Fight,\"; Berne exposes the secret ploys &amp; unconscious maneuvers that rule our intimate lives. Explosive when it first appeared, <i>Games People Play</i> is now widely recognized as the most original &amp; influential popular psychology book of our time. It's as powerful &amp; eye-opening as ever.",

    "description": "The first-born son of his generation, Peter Balakian grew up in a close, extended family, sheltered by 1950s and '60s New Jersey suburbia and immersed in an all-American boyhood defined by rock 'n' roll, adolescent pranks, and a passion for the New York Yankees that he shared with his beloved grandmother. But beneath this sunny world lay the dark specter of the trauma his family and ancestors had experienced--the Turkish government's extermination of more than a million Armenians in 1915, including many of Balakian's relatives, in the century's first genocide.<br /><br />In elegant, moving prose, <b>Black Dog of Fate</b> charts Balakian's growth and personal awakening to the facts of his family's history and the horrifying aftermath of the Turkish government's continued campaign to cover up one of the worst crimes ever committed against humanity. In unearthing the secrets of a family's past and how they affect its present, <i>Black Dog of Fate</i> gives fresh meaning to the story of what it means to be an American.",

Usually we give some clues about the book on the cover, but in this case we think that would spoil the reading of the book. We think it is important that you start to read without knowing what it is about.<br /><br />If you do start to read this book, you will go on a journey with a nine-year-old boy called Bruno. (Though this isn't a book for nine-year-olds.) And sooner or later you will arrive with Bruno at a fence. We hope you never have to cross such a fence.",

    "description": "When a child awakens with dark leaves drifting into her bedroom, she feels that 'sometimes the day begins with nothing to look forward to, and things go from bad to worse.'<br /><br />Feelings too complex for words are rendered into an imaginary landscape where the child wanders, oblivious to the glimmer of promise in the shape of a tiny red leaf. <br /><br />Everything seems hopeless until the child returns to her room and sees the red tree. At that perfect moment of beauty and purity, the child smiles and her world stirs anew.<br /><br />With sensitivity and wonder, Shaun Tan's evocative images in <i>The Red Tree</i> open a window to our inexplicable emotions and tell a story about the power of hope, renewal and inspiration.",

What makes Michael Rosen sad is thinking about his son, Eddie, who died suddenly at the age of eighteen. In this book the author writes about his sadness, how it affects him, and some of the things he does to cope with it\u2014like telling himself that everyone has sad stuff (not just him) and trying every day to do something he can be proud of. Expressively illustrated by the extraordinary Quentin Blake, this is a very personal story that speaks to everyone, from children to parents to grandparents, teachers to grief counselors. Whether or not you have known what it's like to feel deeply sad, the truth of this book will surely touch you.",

    "description": "When Henri Nouwen left the world of academe and headed for the village of Trosly in France, he sought a place that would lead him \"closer to the heart of God.\" Arriving at L'Arche community in Trosly, he felt as if he had finally \"come home.\" Indeed, it was destined to change his life forever.<br /><br /><i>The Road to Daybreak</i> is Henri Nouwen's intimate diary that records his poignant year at L'Arche, which began in the summer of 1985, a precious time of inner renewal and self-discovery. With simplicity and honesty, he describes how the experience changed his attitudes and enriched his spiritual life. Here Nouwen recounts the struggles and self-doubts he faced along this rocky road to a new vocation as he introduces us to the people of L'Arche and many others whose impact on him was deep and life-lasting. Such was the impact of this experience that he chose to say yes to the call to go to L'Arche Daybreak Community in Toronto and make it his permanent home and ministry.<br /><br />Rich in insights and sparkling with touching and inspiring anecdotes, <i>The Road to Daybreak</i> invites the reader to join this renowed spiritual writer on his journey to a deeper understanding of God and the human family.",

That was before one pioneering work documented the underground computer revolution that was about to change our world forever. With groundbreaking profiles of Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, MIT's Tech Model Railroad Club, and more, Steven Levy's <i>Hackers</i> brilliantly captured a seminal moment when the risk-takers and explorers were poised to conquer twentieth-century America's last great frontier. And in the Internet age, the hacker ethic-first espoused here-is alive and well.",

The six begin to seek each other out as puzzling photographs and messages arrive, indicating that the cause may lie in a forgotten weekend stay at an isolated Nevada motel. Koontz has topped a fine roster of horror and suspense novels with an almost unbearably suspenseful page-turner. His ability to maintain the mystery through several plot twists is impressive, as is his array of believable and sympathetic characters. With its masterful blend of elements of espionage, terror, and even some science fiction, Strangers may be the suspense novel of the year.",

    "description": "D'oh-it's \"The Simpsons.\" And here's the book with the behind-the-scenes story of how America's favorite nuclear family first arrived at a TV near you, how the series grew into a worldwide icon, and who brings it to life so brilliantly week after week, year after year. Since first airing in 1987 as a cartoon interlude on the short-lived \"Tracey Ullman Show,\" \"The Simpsons\" has deliciously skewered the foibles of American life, evolving into a cultural institution that reaches across the generations. As satire, it's sharp and funny. As a pop phenom, it's in a league of its own. And with <i>Planet Simpson</i>, it finally gets the sprawling, multidimensional critical look it so richly deserves. \"Smart and funny, Turner writes with fitting enthusiasm for his subject while working in seemly references to cultural theory and TV-insider politics. His book is just the thing for fellow fans, and for anyone interested in how pop phenomena came to be.\" -<i>Hollywood Reporter</i> This book was not prepared, licensed, approved, or endorsed by any entity involved in creating or producing the television series \"The Simpsons.\"",

    "description": "A catastrophic, unexplainable plane crash leaves three hundred and thirty dead--no survivors. Among the victims are the wife and two daughters of Joe Carpenter, a Los Angeles Post crime reporter. <br />A year after the crash, still gripped by an almost paralyzing grief, Joe encounters a woman named Rose, who claims to have survived the crash. She holds out the possibility of a secret that will bring Joe peace of mind. But before he can ask any questions, she slips away. <br />Driven now by rage (have the authorities withheld information?) and a hope almost as unbearable as his grief (if there is one survivor, are there others?), Joe sets out to find the mysterious woman. His search immediately leads him into the path of a powerful and shadowy organization hell-bent on stopping Rose before she can reveal what she knows about the crash. <br />Sole Survivor unfolds at a heart-stopping pace, as a desperate chase and a shattering emotional odyssey lead Joe to a truth that will force him to reassess everything he thought he knew about life and death--a truth that, given the chance, will rock the world and redefine the destiny of humanity.",

But her quest has taken her deeper into the world of psychic phenomena than she ever dreamed -- or dared to go. When the FBI enlists her help in locating the missing father of undercover agent Jack Rose, Darci signs on for the covert operation, not knowing that her attraction to handsome, sexy Jack is about to lead her into deadly territory -- and into an era long past. For Jack has a protector, a mysterious nineteenth-century lady who pulls them into a time and place where Darci is stripped of her abilities. Can she find the key that links to the modern-day crimes she's set out to solve? And will a showdown with a wicked force from the past hold her hostage...for all eternity?",

He is the Sign-Seeker, last of the immortal Old Ones, destined to battle the powers of evil that trouble the land. His task is monumental: he must find and guard the six great Signs of the Light, which, when joined, will create a force strong enough to match and perhaps overcome that of the Dark. Embarking on this endeavor is dangerous as well as deeply rewarding; Will must work within a continuum of time and space much broader than he ever imagined.<br />",

Call her crazy, but Callie has serious reservations about working with the painting's owner. Warm and sexy, Jack Walker makes no attempt to hide the strong attraction he feels for Callie -- even as she tries to keep their relationship professional. Now, cocooned in his studio in Boston, she will either have to learn to ignore the man and concentrate on the masterpiece, or give in to the kind of passion that can never be captured on canvas.<br /><br />Jack Walker is a practical man who runs his life, his empire, and his fortune effortlessly. Yet from the moment he met Callie Burke, he wanted her with all the intensity of a first crush. As he gets to know her, the desire blossoms into something more -- and Jack finds that for the first time in his life he is leading with his heart instead of his head...",

This audacious novel is a brilliant (and literal) head trip of a book that brings us into the wildly active, albeit coma-beset, mind of Roy Strang, whose hallucinatory quest to eradicate the evil predator/scavenger marabou stork keeps being interrupted by grisly memories of the social and family dysfunction that brought him to this state. It is the sort of lethally funny cocktail of pathos, violence, and outrageous hilarity that only Irvine Welsh can pull off.",

The last thing Robertson needs is a messy, racially fraught murder, even if it means overtime\u2014and the opportunity to clinch the promotion he craves. Then there's that nutritionally demanding (and psychologically acute) intestinal parasite in his gut. Yes, things are going badly for this utterly corrupt tribune of the law, but in an Irvine Welsh novel nothing is ever so bad that it can't get a whole lot worse. . .<br /><br />",

    "description": "Can you name five military leaders who were transgendered?<br />Twelve cases of involuntary human experimentation by the U.S. government?<br />How about the four porn novels written by famous authors, 11 books left out of the Bible and over 50 side effects of NutraSweet that have been reported to the FDA?<br /><br />In 1977, David Wallechinsky, Irving Wallace and Amy Wallace published <i>The Book of Lists</i>, causing an immediate sensation. Not only did it lead to three direct sequels (in 1980, 1983 and 1993), it also created a new genre. Soon, shelves were lined with <i>The First Original Unexpurgated Authentic Canadian Book of Lists</i> (1978), <i>The Book of Sports Lists</i> (1979) and <i>Meredith's Book of Bible Lists</i> (1980), among many others. Using this popular, enduring format, Russ Kick's <i>Disinformation Book of Lists</i> delves into the murkier aspects of politics, current events, business, history, science, art and literature, sex, drugs, death and more. Despite such unusual subject matter, this book presents hard, substantiated facts with full references.<br /><br />Among the lists presented:<br /><br />Innocent People Freed from Prison<br />Members of the Skull &amp; Bones Secret Society at Yale<br />Drugs Pulled Off the<br />Market After They Killed Too Many People<br />Legal Substances that Will Get You High<br />Scenes that Were Cut from Movies<br />Raunchy Songs that Were Never Released<br />Military Officers, Government Officials, Astronauts, and Airline Personnel Who Say UFOs Are Real<br />Words and Phrases No Longer Allowed in Textbooks",

    "description": "<br />For Hannah, marriage has never meant happily ever after. Having fled an abusive husband when her daughters were young, she's never had reason to marry again...until now. Her business partner, Max, has proposed because he doesn't want her to be taxed on his estate. Hannah is initially reluctant to enter such an arrangement but logic dictates that she accept. Then, after the wedding, she finds herself spending more time over at Max's and is shocked to discover that she loves him -- wildly and passionately! A part of her wants the marriage to become real, but she's scared of losing herself again -- and more scared, still, that Max doesn't feel the same. <p> Right when she desperately needs the counsel of her two closest friends, Grace is wrapped up with her partner, Bob, and Amelia is away in New York, being tempted by the glamorous life. Will Hannah find the courage to pursue a real marriage? And what will happen to her relationships with Grace and Amelia if she does?<br /></p>",

    "description": "Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? <br /><br />These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life-; from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing-; and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.<br /><br />Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives-; how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In \"Freakonomics,\" they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.<br /><br />What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and-; if the right questions are asked-; is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to seethrough all the clutter.<br /><br />\"Freakonomics\" establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But \"Freakonomics\" can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.<br />(front flap)",

    "description": "The <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, the esoteric but infinitely practical book written most probably in the sixth century B.C. by Lao Tsu, has been translated more frequently than any work except the Bible. This translation of the Chinese classic, which was first published twenty-five years ago, has sold more copies than any of the others. It offers the essence of each word and makes Lao Tsu's teaching immediate and alive.<br /><br />The philosophy of Lao Tsu is simple: Accept what is in front of you without wanting the situation to be other than it is. Study the natural order of things and work with it rather than against it, for to try to change what <i>is</i> only sets up resistance. Nature provides everything without requiring payment or thanks, and also provides for all without discrimination\u2014therefore let us present the same face to everyone and treat all men as equals, however they may behave. If we watch carefully, we will see that work proceeds more quickly and easily if we stop \"trying,\" if we stop putting in so much extra effort, if we stop looking for results. In the clarity of a still and open mind, truth will be reflected. We will come to appreciate the original meaning of the word \"understand,\" which means \"to stand under.\" We serve whatever or whoever stands before us, without any thought for ourselves. <i>Te</i>\u2014which may be translated as \"virtue\" or \"strength\"\u2014lies always in <i>Tao,</i> or\" natural law. In other words: Simply be.",

    "description": "A nineteenth century French priest discovers something in his mountain village at the foot of The Pyrenees which enables him to amass and spend a fortune of millions of pounds. The tale seems to begin with buried treasure and then turns into an unprecedented historical detective story - a modern Grail quest leading back through cryptically coded parchments, secret societies, the Knights Templar, the Cathar heretics of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and a dynasty of obscure French kings deposed more than 1,300 years ago. The author's conclusions are persuasive: at the core is not material riches but a secret - a secret of explosive and controversial proportions, which radiates out from the little Pyrenees village all the way to contemporary politics and the entire edifice of the Christian faith. It involves nothing less than... the Holy Grail.",

    "description": "In Chris Bohjalian's astonishing novel, nothing is what it at first seems. Not the bucolic Vermont back roads college sophomore Laurel Estabrook likes to bike. Not the savage assault she suffers toward the end of one of her rides. And certainly not Bobbie Crocker, the elderly man with a history of mental illness whom Laurel comes to know through her work at a Burlington homeless shelter in the years subsequent to the attack.<br /><br />In his moments of lucidity, the gentle, likable Bobbie alludes to his earlier life as a successful photographer. Laurel finds it hard to believe that this destitute, unstable man could once have chronicled the lives of musicians and celebrities, but a box of photographs and negatives discovered among Bobbie's meager possessions after his death lends credence to his tale. How could such an accomplished man have fallen on such hard times? Becoming obsessed with uncovering Bobbie's past, Laurel studies his photographs, tracking down every lead they provide into the mystery of his life before homelessness -- including links to the rich neighborhoods of her own Long Island childhood and to the earlier world of F. Scott Fitzgerald's <i>The Great Gatsby,</i> with its larger-than-life characters, elusive desires, and haunting sorrows.<br /><br />In a narrative of dazzling invention, literary ingenuity, and psychological complexity, Bohjalian engages issues of homelessness and mental illness by evoking the humanity that inhabits the core of both. At the same time, his tale is fast-paced and riveting -- <i>The Double Bind</i> combines the suspense of a thriller with the emotional depths of the most intimate drama. The breathtaking surprises of its final pages will leave readers stunned, overwhelmed by the poignancy of life's fleeting truths, as caught in Bobbie Crocker's photographs and in Laurel Estabrook's painful pursuit of Bobbie's past -- and her own. <br /><br /><br /><b>Behind <i>The Double Bind</i></b><br /><br />While Bobbie Crocker, the photographer in <i>The Double Bind,</i> is fictitious, the photographs that appear in the book are real. They were taken by a man named Bob \"Soupy\" Campbell, who, as Chris Bohaljian explains in his Author's Note, \"had gone from photographing luminaries from the 1950s and 1960s to winding up at a homeless shelter in northern Vermont.\" <br /><br />Bohaljian's viewing of Campbell's work after the photographer's death provided an inspiration for <i>The Double Bind</i>. \"We tend to stigmatize the homeless and blame them for their plight,\" Bohjalian writes. <br /><br />\"We are oblivious to the fact that most had lives as serious as our own before everything fell apart. The photographs in this book are a testimony to that reality.\"",

    "description": "In this simple, funny picture book, Caldecott Honor Artist David Shannon captures the chaos that follows an unexpected downpour. <p>Once upon a sunny day, the sky clouded over, and the rain came down. The chickens squawked, the dog barked, the baby cried, the traffic snarled, the groceries fell, and still, the rain came down.</p><p>As one noisy event leads to another, the house painter accidentally bonks the barber with his can of paint, and the baker mistakenly pokes the pizza man with his umbrella. Soon the whole block is honking, bickering, and yelling -- and then...the rain stops.</p><p>The sun comes out, and one by one, each character ends up smiling and helping someone else. Here is an engaging story that will brighten the day of any reader -- rain or shine.</p>",

Featuring many photographs, this book also candidly recounts a gifted and celebrated writer's descent into the life of alcohol and drugs that would ultimately consume his bulldog spirit and staggering talent--but not before he'd hobnob with the likes of Grace Paley and Lee Radziwill, feud outrageously with Gore Vidal and Jacqueline Susann, and stage at New York's Plaza Hotel the sensational Black and White Ball.",

Self-medicating with ice cream for breakfast, breaking down at the supermarket, and showing up to work in her bathrobe and bunny slippers-soon she's not only lost her husband, but her job, house...and waistline. With humor and chutzpah Sophie leaves town, determined to reinvent her life. But starting over has its hurdles; soon she's involved with a thirteen-year-old who has a fascination with fire, and a handsome actor who inspires a range of feelings she can't cope with-yet.",

    "description": "An extraordinary novel that ratifies Martin Amis's standing as \"a force unto himself,\" as \"The Washington Post\" has attested: \"There is, quite simply, no one else like him.\" <br />\"House of Meetings\" is a love story, gothic in timbre and triangular in shape. In 1946, two brothers and a Jewish girl fall into alignment in pogrom-poised Moscow. The fraternal conflict then marinates in Norlag, a slave-labor camp above the Arctic Circle, where a tryst in the coveted House of Meetings will haunt all three lovers long after the brothers are released. And for the narrator, the sole survivor, the reverberations continue into the new century. <br />Harrowing, endlessly surprising, epic in breadth yet intensely intimate, \"House of Meetings\" reveals once again that \"Amis is a stone-solid genius . . . a dazzling star of wit and insight\" (\"The Wall Street Journal\").",

    "description": "<b>A young woman caught in the rivalry between Queen Mary and her half sister, Elizabeth, must find her true destiny amid treason, poisonous rivalries, loss of faith, and unrequited love.</b><br /><br />It is winter, 1553. Pursued by the Inquisition, Hannah Green, a fourteen-year-old Jewish girl, is forced to flee Spain with her father. But Hannah is no ordinary refugee. Her gift of \"Sight,\" the ability to foresee the future, is priceless in the troubled times of the Tudor court. Hannah is adopted by the glamorous Robert Dudley, the charismatic son of King Edward's protector, who brings her to court as a \"holy fool\" for Queen Mary and, ultimately, Queen Elizabeth. Hired as a fool but working as a spy; promised in wedlock but in love with her master; endangered by the laws against heresy, treason, and witchcraft, Hannah must choose between the safe life of a commoner and the dangerous intrigues of the royal family that are inextricably bound up in her own yearnings and desires.<br /><br />Teeming with vibrant period detail and peopled by characters seamlessly woven into the sweeping tapestry of history, <i>The Queen's Fool</i> is another rich and emotionally resonant gem from this wonderful storyteller.",

    "description": "The only child of the king of Cornwall, Juniper lives the life of luxury and ease that befits a medieval princess. Still, something compels her to leave the palace to take up a difficult life of study with godmother, Euny. The harsh but wise woman proceeds to teach the girl about herbs, healing, and the magic within nature.<br /><br />It is not until Juniper returns home a year and a day later that she begins to understand the purpose of her training. Meroot, her power-hungry aunt, is using black magic in an attempt to seize the throne. Meroot has not only placed a terrible curse on the countryside but also threatened the life of Juniper's unborn brother--the future king of Cornwall. Armed only with her new, untested powers, Juniper must find a way to stop Meroot--before the kingdom itself is destroyed.<br /><br />The prequel to the spellbinding fantasy <i>Wise Child</i>, <i>Juniper</i> evokes a distant era when spiritual and earthly powers were inextricably entwined.",

    "description": "<i>A gritty, heart-wrenching novel about bruised innocence on the city's feral streets\u2014the remarkable debut of a stunning literary talent</i><br /><br />Heather O'Neill dazzles with a first novel of extraordinary prescience and power, a subtly understated yet searingly effective story of a young life on the streets\u2014and the strength, wits, and luck necessary for survival.<br /><br />At thirteen, Baby vacillates between childhood comforts and adult temptation: still young enough to drag her dolls around in a vinyl suitcase yet old enough to know more than she should about urban cruelties. Motherless, she lives with her father, Jules, who takes better care of his heroin habit than he does of his daughter. Baby's gift is a genius for spinning stories and for cherishing the small crumbs of happiness that fall into her lap. But her blossoming beauty has captured the attention of a charismatic and dangerous local pimp who runs an army of sad, slavishly devoted girls\u2014a volatile situation even the normally oblivious Jules cannot ignore. And when an escape disguised as betrayal threatens to crush Baby's spirit, she will ultimately realize that the power of salvation rests in her hands alone.",

    "description": "So my only protection is a kindergarten teacher and a ninety-eight-pound female minister....And they don't even believe I'm in danger. <br /> As Bethany approaches her thirteenth birthday, her parents begin acting more oddly than usual: Her mother cries constantly, and her father barely lets Bethany out of his sight. Then one morning he hustles the entire family into the car, drives across several state lines -- and leaves Bethany with an aunt she never knew existed. Bethany has no idea what's going on. She's worried that her mom and dad are running from some kind of trouble, but she can't find out because they won't tell her where they are going. <br /> Bethany's only clue is a few words she overheard her father tell her aunt Myrlie: \"She doesn't know anything about Elizabeth.\" But Aunt Myrlie won't tell Bethany who Elizabeth is, and she won't explain why people in her small town react to Bethany as if they've seen a ghost. The mystery intensifies when Bethany gets a package from her father containing four different birth certificates from four states, with four different last names -- and thousands of dollars in cash. And when a strange man shows up asking questions, Bethany realizes she's not the only one who's desperate to unravel the secrets of her past. <br /> In this exhilarating thriller, Margaret Peterson Haddix crafts a taut story so full of twists and turns, readers will be gripped until the startling conclusion.",

    "description": "This classic of twentieth-century literature chronicles the spiritual evolution of a man living in India at the time of the Buddha--a spiritual journey that has inspired generations of readers. Here is a fresh translation from Sherab Chodzin Kohn, a gifted translator and longtime student of Buddhism and Eastern philosophy. Kohn's flowing, poetic translation conveys the philosophical and spiritual nuances of Hesse's text, paying special attention to the qualities of meditation experience. This edition also includes an introduction exploring Hesse's own spiritual journey as evidenced in his journals and personal letters.",

    "description": "<p>Arch-swindler Moist von Lipwig never believed his confidence crimes were hanging offenses -- until he found himself with a noose tightly around his neck, dropping through a trapdoor, and falling into ... a government job?</p> <p>By all rights, Moist should have met his maker. Instead, it's Lord Vetinari, supreme ruler of Ankh-Morpork, who promptly offers him a job as Postmaster. Since his only other option is a nonliving one, Moist accepts the position -- and the hulking golem watchdog who comes along with it, just in case Moist was considering abandoning his responsibilities prematurely.</p> <p>Getting the moribund Postal Service up and running again, however, may be a near-impossible task, what with literally mountains of decades-old undelivered mail clogging every nook and cranny of the broken-down post office building; and with only a few creaky old postmen and one rather unstable, pin-obsessed youth available to deliver it. Worse still, Moist could swear the mail is talking to him. Worst of all, it means taking on the gargantuan, money-hungry Grand Trunk clacks communication monopoly and its bloodthirsty piratical head, Mr. Reacher Gilt.</p> <p>But it says on the building neither rain nor snow nor glo m of ni t ... Inspiring words (admittedly, some of the bronze letters have been stolen), and for once in his wretched life Moist is going to fight. And if the bold and impossible are what's called for, he'll do it -- in order to move the mail, continue breathing, get the girl, and specially deliver that invaluable commodity that every human being (not to mention troll, dwarf, and, yes, even golem) requires: hope.</p>",

    "description": "The ne'er-do-well sire of a starving brood suddenly discovers a family connection to the aristocracy, and his selfish scheme to capitalize on their wealth sets a fateful plot in motion. Jack Durbeyfield dispatches his gentle daughter Tess to the home of their noble kin, anticipating a lucrative match between the lovely girl and a titled cousin. Innocent Tess finds the path of the d'Urberville estate paved with ruin in this gripping tale of the inevitability of fate and the tragic nature of existence.<br />Subtitled <i>A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented,</i> Thomas Hardy's sympathetic portrait of a blameless young woman's destruction first appeared in 1891. Its powerful indictment of Victorian hypocrisy, along with its unconventional focus on the rural lower class and its direct treatment of sexuality and religion, raised a ferocious public outcry. <i>Tess of the D'Ubervilles</i> is Hardy's penultimate novel; the pressures of critical infamy shortly afterward drove the author to abandon the genre in favor of poetry. Like his fictional heroine, the artist fell victim to a rigidly oppressive moral code. <br />Today, <i>Tess</i> is regarded as Hardy's masterpiece, embodying all of the most profoundly moving elements of its creator's dark vision. No perspective on 19th-century fiction is complete without a consideration of this compelling tale, now available in an inexpensive and high-quality edition.",

    "description": "It is the year 2007. The world has been wiped out by a deadly plague that killed all the adults. Without them, children perished of hunger and disease. No more people, no more electricity, no more civilization -- just mildewed houses, overgrown yards, and abandoned cars. Yet on a highway strip outside a small town in Florida, the words \"We're Still Here\" are painted in letters big enough to be seen from an airplane -- although no planes ever cross the empty sky.<br /><br />Miraculously, seven children have survived among the ruins. They cannot remember their names, their families, or much else from the Before Time. But they have forged a new family, with new names: Mommy, Hunter, Teacher, Action Figure, Teddy Bear, Baby, and Doll.<br /><br />They must face each day with enough hope to endure and the strength to realize that there may be nothing out there worth living for. Then one day, a new kid shows up on their doorstep and changes everything. He invites them to join him on a dangerous journey to Washington, to find a man called President if he's still alive -- and seek the answers to the mystery at the heart of the Fire-us.<br /><br />In this first book of the Fire-us Trilogy, Jennifer Armstrong and Nancy Butcher weave a compelling post-apocalyptic tale, luring readers into a world that is inventive enough to intrigue, yet true enough to believe.",

He's never had a birthday party, or gone to a friend's house for an overnight. In fact, Luke has never had a friend.<br /><br />Luke is one of the shadow children, a third child forbidden by the Population Police. He's lived his entire life in hiding, and now, with a new housing development replacing the woods next to his family's farm, he is no longer even allowed to go outside.<br /><br />Then, one day Luke sees a girl's face in the window of a house where he knows two other children already live. Finally, he's met a shadow child like himself. Jen is willing to risk everything to come out of the shadows -- does Luke dare to become involved in her dangerous plan? Can he afford not to?",

    "description": "When Amos Tutuola's first novel, The Palm-Wine Drinkard, appeared in 1952, it aroused exceptional worldwide interest. Drawing on the West African Yoruba oral folktale tradition, Tutuola described the odyssey of a devoted palm-wine drinker through a nightmare of fantastic adventure. Since then, The Palm-Wine Drinkard has been translated into more than 15 languages and has come to be regarded as a masterwork of one of Africa's most influential writers. Tutuola's second novel, My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, recounts the fate of mortals who stray into the world of ghosts, the heart of the tropical forest. Here, as every hunter and traveler knows, mortals venture at great peril, and it is here that a small boy is left alone.",

    "description": "<i>Mysteries</i> (1892) is the story of Johan Nilsen Nagel, a mysterious stranger who suddenly turns up in a small Norwegian town one summer-and just as suddenly disappears. Nagel is a complete outsider, a sort of modern Christ treated in a spirit of near parody. He condemns the politics and thought of the age, brings comfort to the insulted and injured and gains the love of two women suggestive of the biblical Mary and Martha. But there is a sinister side of him: in his vest he carries a vial of Prussic acid. The novel creates a powerful sense of Nagel's stream of thought, as he increasingly withdraws into the torture chamber of his own subconscious psyche.",
