    "description": "Krabat, a fourteen-year-old Wendish beggar boy, is summoned in a dream to a mysterious mill. When he awakens, an irresistible force makes him seek out a mill near the village of Schwarzkollm where he becomes apprenticed to the master. He soon discovers that the mill is actually a school for black magic and that he and the mill's journeymen are virtual prisoners. During the week they do the normal work of the mill, but on Friday nights, the master initiates them into the strange rituals of the Art of Arts. The very first Friday, the master turns Krabat into a raven, a trick the boy quickly learns to do himself.<br /><br />Krabat completes his apprenticeship, becomes a journeyman and the master's star pupil in necromancy. But the power his new skills endow him with does not compensate for his loss of freedom. And the more he learns of the mill's dark secrets, the more determined he becomes to escape from the master's bondage.<br /><br />The Satanic Mill is set against the colorful background of seventeenth-century Germany. The story of Krabat's captive apprenticeship and ultimate victory over the master is an unusual, tension-packed thriller that readers of all ages will find difficult to put down until the last page is turned.<br /><br />Called a masterpiece by reviewers in Germany, The Satanic Mill was awarded the 1972 German Children's Book Prize.",

Reverberating with all the creative energy - and poetry - of a legendary time, \"Off the Road\" is the authentic story of the people who captured the imagination of America's youth and brought this country into the 1960s.",

    "description": "At the beginning of <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> a young slave woman, fearing for her infant's son's life, exchanges her light-skinned child with her master's.\u00a0\u00a0From this rather simple premise Mark Twain fashioned one of his most entertaining, funny, yet biting novels.\u00a0\u00a0On its surface, <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> possesses all the elements of an engrossing nineteenth-century mystery:\u00a0\u00a0reversed identities, a horrible crime, an eccentric detective, a suspenseful courtroom drama, and a surprising, unusual solution.\u00a0\u00a0Yet it is not a mystery novel.\u00a0\u00a0Seething with the undercurrents of antebellum southern culture, the book is a savage indictment in which the real criminal is society, and racial prejudice and slavery are the crimes.\u00a0\u00a0Written in 1894, <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> glistens with characteristic Twain humor, with suspense, and with pointed irony:\u00a0\u00a0a gem among the author's later works.",

This triumphant collection includes thirty-six of the finest stories of her career including eight new pieces that have not appeared in a book before. <br />Beattie's characters embark on stoned cross-country odysseys with lovers who may leave them before the engine cools. They comfort each other amid the ashes of failed relationships and in hospital waiting rooms. They try to locate themselves in a world where all the old landmarks have been turned into theme parks. Funny and sorrowful, fiercely compressed yet emotionally<br />expansive, <b>Park City</b> is dazzling.",

For among the finches of Daphne Major, natural selection is neither rare nor slow: it is taking place by the hour, and we can watch.<br /><br />In this dramatic story of groundbreaking scientific research, Jonathan Weiner follows these scientists as they watch Darwin's finches and come up with a new understanding of life itself. <i>The Beak of the Finch\u00a0</i>is an elegantly written and compelling masterpiece of theory and explication in the tradition of Stephen Jay Gould.<br /><br />With a new preface.",

    "description": "Mark Twain's fantastical last novel took him twelve years--and three long drafts\u2014to complete. Based on boyhood memories of the Mississippi River Valley and of the print shops of Hannibal, the story is set in medieval Austria at the dawn of the printing craft. It is a psychic adventure, full of phantasmagoric effects, in which a penniless printer's apprentice\u2014a youthful, mysterious stranger with the curious name 44\u2014gradually reveals his otherworldly powers and the hidden possibilities of the mind. Ending on a startling note, this surprisingly existential novel reveals a darker side to the author's genius.<br /><br />This long-overlooked work appears here as Mark Twain intended it and replaces the bogus 1916 edition published by Albert Bigelow Paine, which relied on the first, instead of the final, draft, deleted one-fourth of the words, added a character, and misrepresented the ending. In addition, for the first time in the Mark Twain Library edition, a glossary of printer's terms is featured along with expert notes and commentary.",

    "description": "<b>Everybody Out of the Pond</b> <br /><i>At the Water's Edge</i> will change the way you think about your place in the world. The awesome journey of life's transformation from the first microbes 4 billion years ago to <i>Homo sapiens</i> today is an epic that we are only now beginning to grasp. Magnificent and bizarre, it is the story of how we got here, what we left behind, and what we brought with us. <br /> We all know about evolution, but it still seems absurd that our ancestors were fish. Darwin's idea of natural selection was the key to solving generation-to-generation evolution -- microevolution -- but it could only point us toward a complete explanation, still to come, of the engines of macroevolution, the transformation of body shapes across millions of years. Now, drawing on the latest fossil discoveries and breakthrough scientific analysis, Carl Zimmer reveals how macroevolution works. Escorting us along the trail of discovery up to the current dramatic research in paleontology, ecology, genetics, and embryology, Zimmer shows how scientists today are unveiling the secrets of life that biologists struggled with two centuries ago. <br /> In this book, you will find a dazzling, brash literary talent and a rigorous scientific sensibility gracefully brought together. Carl Zimmer provides a comprehensive, lucid, and authoritative answer to the mystery of how nature actually made itself.",

    "description": "How do you find a new way to approach a story as familiar as any in the English language? If you're Jack Whyte, you begin your retelling of the Arthurian saga by taking one giant step backward to the latter days of the Roman Empire in Britain, sometime between the first breaching of Hadrian's Wall and the legendary days of King Arthur. Publius Varrus is the last legionnaire in Britain, and <i>The Skystone</i> is in many ways his story. He is a common man with aristocratic friends, and successful both as a soldier and an ironsmith. As the Roman world slowly crumbles around them, and Publius becomes involved in a political and personal vendetta, he and his friends seek to establish a refuge, a valley where the old Roman virtues will be kept alive and the empire's many faults be avoided. <p> A finely crafted historical novel, <i>The Skystone</i> pays close attention to the details of everyday life in fourth-century Britain. As the first book in Whyte's Camulod Chronicles, it makes few allusions to the usual details of the Arthurian legends until Publius comes into contact with a sword, a stone, a lake, and a Celtic tribe who name themselves Pendragon. <i>Greg L. Johnson</i></p>",

That is the real charm of Hawthorne\u2019s writing\u2014this purity and spontaneity and naturalness of fancy.\u201d",

The excitement began the moment \"The Fourth State of Matter,\" one of the fourteen extraordinary personal narratives in this book, appeared in the pages of <i>The New Yorker</i>. It increased when the author received a prestigious Whiting Foundation Award in November 1997, &amp; it continued as the hardcover edition of <i>The Boys of My Youth</i> sold out its first printing even before publication. The author writes with perfect pitch as she takes us through one woman's life -- from childhood to marriage &amp; beyond -- &amp; memorably captures the collision of youthful longing &amp; the hard intransigences of time &amp; fate.",

    "description": "A brilliant and faithful rendering of the Anglo-Saxon epic from the Nobel laureate.<br /><br />Composed toward the end of the first millennium of our era, <i>Beowulf</i> is the elegiac narrative of the adventures of Beowulf, a Scandinavian hero who saves the Danes from the seemingly invincible monster Grendel and, later, from Grendel's mother. He then returns to his own country and dies in old age in a vivid fight against a dragon. The poem is about encountering the monstrous, defeating it, and then having to live on in the exhausted aftermath. In the contours of this story, at once remote and uncannily familiar at the end of the twentieth century, Seamus Heaney finds a resonance that summons power to the poetry from deep beneath its surface.<br /><br />Drawn to what he has called the \"four-squareness of the utterance\" in<i> Beowulf </i>and its immense emotional credibility, Heaney gives these epic qualities new and convincing reality for the contemporary reader.",

And then the monotony breaks. Something \u2014 a freak of creation \u2014 is running amok in the fields. To solve the mystery, three generations of prodigal sons \u2014 a writer and hometown boy who swore he'd never come back to Penn's Woods; a middle-aged former pugilist who runs a decrepit boxing gym; and a misfit, mute, beaten-down Amish boy \u2014 are brought together by the light of a blue moon, in a town called Blue Ball. On one level this is a masterfully orchestrated, hilarious, and compelling take on the classic horror yarn, on another, <i>Kornwolf</i> is a social satire of suburban sprawl, closed minds, and all manners and varieties of self-satisfaction \u2014 Amish, civilian, or... <i>other</i> \u2014 in the best tradition of Tom Robbins and George Saunders.",

    "description": "<i>Castle Waiting</i> graphic novel tells the story of an isolated, abandoned castle, and the eccentric inhabitants who bring it back to life. A fable for modern times, <i>Castle Waiting</i> is a fairy tale that's not about rescuing the princess, saving the kingdom, or fighting the ultimate war between Good and Evil, but about being a hero in your own home. <br /><br />The opening story, \"The Brambly Hedge,\" tells the origin of the castle itself, which is abandoned by its princess in a comic twist on \"Sleeping Beauty\" when she rides off into the sunset with her Prince Charming. The castle becomes a refuge for misfits, outcasts, and others seeking sanctuary, playing host to a lively and colorful cast of characters that inhabits the subsequent stories, including a talking anthropomorphic horse, a mysteriously pregnant Lady on the run, and a bearded nun.",

    "description": "In the spirit of T.E. Lawrence, Wilfred Thesiger spent five years wandering the deserts of Arabia, producing <i>Arabian Sands</i>, 'a memorial to a vanished past, a tribute to a once magnificent people'. The Penguin Classics edition includes an introduction by Rory Stewart.<br /><br />Wilfred Thesiger, repulsed by what he saw as the softness and rigidity of Western life - 'the machines, the calling cards, the meticulously aligned streets' - spent years exploring in and around the vast, waterless desert that is the 'Empty Quarter' of Arabia. Travelling amongst the Bedu people, he experienced their everyday challenges of hunger and thirst, the trials of long marches beneath the relentless sun, the bitterly cold nights and the constant danger of death if it was discovered he was a Christian 'infidel'. He was the first European to visit most of the region, and just before he left the area the process that would change it forever had begun - the discovery of oil.<br /><br />This edition contains an introduction by Rory Stewart discussing the dangers of Thesiger's travels, his unconventional personality and his insights into the Bedouin way of life.<br /><br />Sir Wilfred Patrick Thesiger (1910-2003) was a British travel writer born in Addis Ababa in Abyssinia (now Ethiopia). Thesiger is best known for two travel books: <i>Arabian Sands</i> (1959), which recounts his travels in the Empty Quarter of Arabia between 1945 and 1950 and describes the vanishing way of life of the Bedouins, and <i>The Marsh Arabs</i> (1964), an account of the traditional peoples who lived in the marshlands of southern Iraq.<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>Arabian Sands</i>, you might like T.E. Lawrence's <i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i>, also available in Penguin Modern Classics<br /><br />'Thesiger is perhaps the last, and certainly one of the greatest, of the British travellers among the Arabs'<br /><i>Sunday Times</i><br /><br />'Following worthily in the tradition of Burton, Lawrence, Philby and Thomas, it is, very likely, the book about Arabia to end all books about Arabia'<br /><i>Daily Telegraph</i>",

    "description": "In this extraordinary book, Bruce Chatwin has adapted a literary form common until the eighteenth century though rare in ours; a story of ideas in which two companions, traveling and talking together, explore the hopes and dreams that animate both them and the people they encounter. Set in almost uninhabitable regions of Central Australia, <i>The Songlines</i> asks and tries to answer these questions: Why is man the most restless, dissatisfied of animals? Why do wandering people conceive the world as perfect whereas sedentary ones always try to change it? Why have the great teachers\u2014Christ or the Buddha\u2014recommended the Road as the way. to salvation? Do we agree with Pascal that all man's troubles stem from his inability to sit quietly in a room?<br /><br />We do not often ask these questions today for we commonly assume that living in a house is normal and that the wandering life is aberrant. But for more than twenty years Chatwin has mulled over the possibility that the reverse might be the case.<br /><br />Pre-colonial Australia was the last landmass on earth peopled not by herdsmen, farmers, or city dwellers, but by hunter-gatherers. Their labyrinths of invisible pathways across the continent are known to us as Songlines or Dreaming Tracks, but to the Aboriginals as the tracks of their ancestors\u2014the Way of the Law. Along these \"roads\" they travel in order to perform all those activities that are distinctively human\u2014song, dance, marriage, exchange of ideas, and arrangements of territorial boundaries by agreement rather than force.<br /><br />In Chatwin's search for the Songlines, Arkady is an ideal friend and guide: Australian by birth, the son of a Cossack exile, with all the strength and warmth of his inheritance. Whether hunting kangaroo from a Land Cruiser, talking to the diminutive Rolf in his book-crammed trailer, buying drinks for a bigoted policeman (and would-be writer), cheering as Arkady's true love declares herself (part of <i>The Songlines</i> is a romantic comedy), Chatwin turns this almost implausible picaresque adventure into something approaching the scale of a Greek tragedy.<br /><br />The life of the Aboriginals stands in vivid contrast, of course, to the prevailing cultures of our time. And <i>The Songlines</i> presents unforgettable details about the kinds of disputes we know all too well from less traumatic confrontations: over sacred lands invaded by railroads, mines, and construction sites, over the laws and rights of a poor people versus a wealthy invasive one. To Chatwin these are but recent, local examples of an eternal basic distinction between settlers and wanderers. His book, devoted to the latter, is a brilliant evocation of this profound optimism: that man is by nature not a bellicose aggressor but a pacific, song-creating, adaptive species whose destiny is to quest for the truth.",

    "description": "<i>Take a Walk on the Dark Side</i> is the ultimate book for today's rock and roll fan: a fascinating compendium of facts, fictions, prophecies, premonitions, coincidences, hoaxes, doomsday scenarios, and other urban legends about some of the world's most beloved and mysterious pop icons. <p> Updating, revising, and expanding on material from his cult classic <i>Hellhounds on Their Trail,</i> Patterson offers up a delectable feast of strange and occasionally frightening rock and roll tales, featuring the ironies associated with the tragic deaths of many rock icons, unsolved murders, and other tales from the \"fell clutch of circumstance.\" </p><p> Beginning with the fateful place where it all started -- a deserted country crossroads just outside Clarksdale, Mississippi, where Robert Johnson made his deal with the devil -- through the Buddy Holly curse (rock and roll's first great tragedy) and beyond, this incredible volume uncovers some of rock and roll's most celebrated murders, twists of fate, and decades-long streaks of bad luck that defy rational explanation. Inside you'll find: </p><p> </p>  Facts about Jimmy Page and the Zeppelin Curse.  \n   Chilling quirks of fate in the fatalities in the Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd.  \n   Facts about Jimmy Page and the Zeppelin curse  \n   Chilling quirks of fate surrounding the deaths of musicians in the Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd  \n   A provocative look at \"The Club,\" membership in which requires an untimely death at age twenty-seven and whose inductees include Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, and Janis Joplin  \n   Cryptic messages in song lyrics that have proved eerily prophetic  \n <p> Carefully researched, wildly enjoyable, and often harrowing, <i>Take a Walk on the Dark Side</i> takes the reader on a mysterious ride through rock and roll history.</p>",

    "description": "<i>American Skin</i> was first published in the United Kingdom to resounding acclaim after the author used his last seventy-five dollars to make an unsolicited submission to the publisher of the Scottish beats, whose work he admired. It is a timeless story about a young man's coming-of-age as well as a stunning portrait of the class and racial tensions that pervade our society. <p> Alex Verdi is on the lam, fleeing from the police who have arrested his parents on drug charges and want him for questioning. Traveling to Chicago, he joins a multiracial group of anti-Nazi skinheads and embarks on an odyssey that takes him from the city's embattled streets to an Army boot camp to Northwestern's plush campus, and finally lands him amid the horrors of maximum-security prison. </p><p> In this intense and gripping debut, Don De Grazia confirms his stature as a young writer of uncommon seriousness and consummate artistry.</p>",

    "description": "In 1960 the government of Trinidad invited V. S. Naipaul to revisit his native country and record his impressions. In this classic of modern travel writing he has created a deft and remarkably prescient portrait of Trinidad and four adjacent Caribbean societies\u2013countries haunted by the legacies of slavery and colonialism and so thoroughly defined by the norms of Empire that they can scarcely believe that the Empire is ending.<br />In <b>The Middle Passage</b>, Naipaul watches a Trinidadian movie audience greeting Humphrey Bogart\u2019s appearance with cries of \u201cThat is man!\u201d He ventures into a Trinidad slum so insalubrious that the locals call it the Gaza Strip. He follows a racially charged election campaign in British Guiana (now Guyana) and marvels at the Gallic pretension of Martinique society, which maintains the fiction that its roads are extensions of France\u2019s <i>routes nationales.</i> And throughout he relates the ghastly episodes of the region\u2019s colonial past and shows how they continue to inform its language, politics, and values. The result is a work of novelistic vividness and dazzling perspicacity that displays Naipaul at the peak of his powers.",

    "description": "Herman Wouk is one of this century's great historical novelists, whose peerless talent for capturing the human drama of landmark world events has earned him worldwide acclaim. In The Hope, his long-awaited return to historical fiction, he turns to one of the most thrilling stories of our time - the saga of Israel. In the grand, epic style of The Winds of War and War and Remembrance, The Hope plunges the reader into the major battles, the disasters and victories, and the fragile periods of peace from the 1948 War of Independence to the astounding triumph of the Six-Day War in 1967. And since Israelis have seen their share of comic mishaps as well as heroism, this novel offers some of Herman Wouk's most amusing scenes since the famed \"strawberry business\" in The Caine Mutiny. First to last The Hope is a tale of four Israeli army officers and the women they love: Zev Barak, Viennese-born cultured military man; Benny Luria, ace fighter pilot with religious stirrings; Sam Pasternak, sardonic and mysterious Mossad man; and an antic dashing warrior they call Kishote, Hebrew for Quixote, who arrives at Israel's first pitched battle a refugee boy on a mule and over the years rises to high rank. In the love stories of these four men, the author of Marjorie Morningstar has created a gallery of three memorable Israeli women and one quirky fascinating American, daughter of a high CIA official and headmistress of a Washington girls school. With the authenticity, authority, and narrative force of Wouk's finest fiction, The Hope portrays not so much the victory of one people over another, as the gallantry of the human spirit, surviving and triumphing against crushing odds. In that sense it can be called a tale of hope for all mankind; a note that Herman Wouk has struck in all his writings, against the prevailing pessimism of our turbulent century.",

    "description": "Like no other novelist at work today, Herman Wouk has managed to capture the sweep of history in novels rich in character and alive with drama. In \"The Hope,\" which opens in 1948 and culminates in the miraculous triumph of 1967's Six-Day War, Wouk plunges the reader into the story of a nation struggling for its birth and then its survival. As the tale resumes in \"The Glory,\" Wouk portrays the young nation once again pushed to the brink of annihilation -- and sets the stage for today's ongoing struggle for peace.<br /><br />Taking us from the Sinai to Jerusalem, from dust-choking battles to the Entebbe raid, from Camp David to the inner lives of such historical figures as Golda Meir, Moshe Dayan, and Anwar Sadat, these extraordinary novels have the authenticity and authority of Wouk's finest fiction -- and together strike a resounding chord of hope for all humanity.",

An outspoken thinker, a celebrated actress, a truly independent woman, Shirley MacLaine goes beyond her previous two bestsellers to take us on an intimate yet powerful journey into her personal life and inner self.

From Stockholm to Hawaii to the mountain vastness of Peru, from disbelief to radiant affirmation, she at last discovers the roots of her very existence. . . and the infinite possibilities of life. Shirley MacLaine opens her heart to explore the meaning of a great and enduring passion with her lover Gerry; the mystery of her soul's connection with her best friend David; the tantalizing secrets behind a great actor's inspiration with the late Peter Sellers. And through it all, Shirley MacLaine's courage and candor new doors, new insights, new revelations-and a luminous new world she invites us all to share.\"A stunningly honest, engrossing account of an intimate journey inward. Shirley MacLaine's discovery of a new sense of purpose, joy, energy, and love will touch and astonish you.\"-- \"Literary Guild Magazine\" .<br /><br />\"An immensely appealing woman-bright, open, straightforward, sincere.\"-- \"The New York Daily News\"",

    "description": "Written in the thirteenth century, Njal's Saga is a story that explores perennial human problems-from failed marriages to divided loyalties, from the law's inability to curb human passions to the terrible consequences when decent men and women are swept up in a tide of violence beyond their control. It is populated by memorable and complex characters like Gunnar of Hlidarendi, a powerful warrior with an aversion to killing, and the not-so-villainous Mord Valgardsson. Full of dreams, strange prophecies, violent power struggles, and fragile peace agreements, Njal's Saga tells the compelling story of a fifty-year blood feud that, despite its distance from us in time and place, is driven by passions familiar to us all. This Penguin Classics edition includes an introduction, chronology, index of characters, plot summary, explanatory notes, maps, and suggestions for further reading.",

The better furniture was hung over with drop cloths, the leather-bound books evacuated from their shelves.... Unconnected wiring threaded from walls, and a smell of lazy drains, something rotting, unfurled from the sewer all the way up to this flat. Winnie wrenched open a window. But no sign of John?<p>Winifred Rudge, a bemused writer struggling to get beyond the runaway success of her mass-market astrology book, travels to London to jump-start her new novel about a woman who is being haunted by the ghost of Jack the Ripper. Upon her arrival, she finds that her stepcousin and old friend John Comestor has disappeared, and a ghostly presence seems to have taken over his apartment in the nineteenth-century rowhouse once owned by Winnie's great-great-grandfather. Is it the spirit of this ancestor, who, family legend claims, was Charles Dickens's childhood inspiration for Ebenezer Scrooge? Could it be the ghostly remains of Jack the Ripper? Or a phantasm derived from a more arcane and insidious origin?</p><p>Winnie begins to investigate, but John's erstwhile girlfriend, Allegra, is aggressively unhelpful, and his downstairs neighbor, the cat-obsessed Mrs. Maddingly, is growing stranger by the day. Gripped by inspiration and desperation alike, Winnie finds herself the unwilling audience for a drama of specters and shades, some from her family's peculiar history and some from her own unvanquished past.</p><p>In the spirit of A. S. Byatt's <i>Possession</i>, with dark overtones echoing from <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, <i>Lost</i> presents a rich fictional world that will enrapture Gregory Maguire's eager audience.</p>",

    "description": "Go to any unpopulated or abandoned area in any given urban setting, and you'll find them. Thousands and thousands of wild dogs-abandoned to disease, starvation, and inevitable death-are leading short and brutal lives in the no-man's-land between domestication and wildness, byproducts of the human destitution around them. A lucky few are saved by dedicated rescuers, and Randy Grim, has emerged as one of the country's leading dog saviors. After years of rescuing dogs on his own, he founded Stray Rescue of St. Louis, an organization dedicated to rescue and rehabilitation. <br /><br />These are dogs that belong to no one, the ones animal-control experts can't catch and humane shelters won't deal with. They are stray or feral, either abandoned or born wild on the streets, which means they won't come near humans and statistically won't live past their second year. And their numbers are growing every day.<br /><br />In <i>The Man Who Talks to Dogs</i>, journalist Melinda Roth narrates Grim's dramatic, inspiring efforts and tells the horrific and heartwarming stories of the dogs he saves, showing how this growing national health problem-controlled by no federal or local regulations-can no longer be ignored.<br />",

    "description": "<i>\"When compared to the fact that he might very well be dead by this time tomorrow, whether he was courageous or not today was pointless, empty. When compared to the fact that he might be dead tomorrow, everything was pointless. Life was pointless. Whether he looked at a tree or not was pointless. It just didn't make any difference. It was pointless to the tree, it was pointless to every man in his outfit, pointless to everybody in the whole world. Who cared? It was not pointless only to him; and when he was dead, when he ceased to exist, it would be pointless to him too. More important: Not only would it </i>be<i> pointless, it would </i>have been<i> pointless, all along.\"</i><br /><br />Such is the ultimate significance of war in <i>The Thin Red Line</i> (1962), James Jones's fictional account of the battle between American and Japanese troops on the island of Guadalcanal. The narrative shifts effortlessly among multiple viewpoints within C-for-Charlie Company, from commanding officer Capt. James Stein, his psychotic first sergeant Eddie Welsh, and the young privates they send into battle. The descriptions of combat conditions\u2014and the mental states it induces\u2014are unflinchingly realistic, including the dialog (in which a certain word Norman Mailer rendered as \"fug\" 15 years earlier in <i>The Naked and the Dead</i> appears properly spelled on numerous occasions). This is more than a classic of combat fiction; it is one of the most significant explorations of male identity in American literature, establishing Jones as a novelist of the caliber of Herman Melville and Stephen Crane.",

With this book, Gore, who is one of our environmental heroes\u2014and a leading expert\u2014brings together leading-edge research from top scientists around the world; photographs, charts, and other illustrations; and personal anecdotes and observations to document the fast pace and wide scope of global warming. He presents, with alarming clarity and conclusiveness\u2014and with humor, too\u2014that the fact of global warming is not in question and that its consequences for the world we live in will be disastrous if left unchecked. This riveting new book\u2014written in an accessible, entertaining style\u2014will open the eyes of even the most skeptical.",

The money for materials will come from their first wheat crop. Then, just before the wheat is ready to harvest, a strange glittering cloud fills the sky, blocking out the sun. Soon millions of grasshoppers cover the field and everything on the farm. In a week's time, there is no wheat crop left at all. Unabridged. Paul Woodiel plays the fiddle. Read by Cherry Jones. 6 hours. Recommended for ages 8 and up. A 1938 Newbery Honor book.",

    "description": "From Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes to provocative dung-splattered madonnas, in today's art world many strange, even shocking, things are put on display. This often leads exasperated viewers to exclaim--is this really art?<br /><br />In this invaluable primer on aesthetics, Freeland explains why innovation and controversy are so highly valued in art, weaving together philosophy and art theory with many engrossing examples. Writing clearly and perceptively, she explores the cultural meanings of art in different contexts, and highlights the continuities of tradition that stretch from modern, often sensational, works back to the ancient halls of the Parthenon, to the medieval cathedral of Chartres, and to African nkisi nkondi fetish statues. She explores the difficulties of interpretation, examines recent scientific research into the ways the brain perceives art, and looks to the still-emerging worlds of art on the web, video art, art museum CD-ROMS, and much more. In addition, Freeland guides us through the various theorists of art, from Aristotle and Kant to Baudrillard. Lastly, throughout this nuanced account of theories, artists, and works, Freeland provides us with a rich understanding of how cultural significance is captured in a physical medium, and why challenging our perceptions is, and always has been, central to the whole endeavor.<br /><br />It is instructive to recall that Henri Matisse himself was originally derided as a \"wild beast.\" To horrified critics, his bold colors and distorted forms were outrageous. A century later, what was once shocking is now considered beautiful. And that, writes Freeland, is art.<br />",

Fortunately her sunny nature and quirky imagination win the hearts of her reluctant foster parents and everyone in the community. But not a day goes by without some memorable adventure or prank in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on she accidentally dyes her a oecurseda red hair green. Later, in an effort to impress a neighbor she bakes a cake, but with liniment instead of vanilla.",

    "description": "Michel de Montaigne was one of the most influential figures of the Renaissance, singlehandedly responsible for popularising the essay as a literary form. This Penguin Classics edition of <i>The Complete Essays</i> is translated from the French and edited with an introduction and notes by M.A. Screech.<br /><br />In 1572 Montaigne retired to his estates in order to devote himself to leisure, reading and reflection. There he wrote his constantly expanding 'assays', inspired by the ideas he found in books contained in his library and from his own experience. He discusses subjects as diverse as war-horses and cannibals, poetry and politics, sex and religion, love and friendship, ecstasy and experience. But, above all, Montaigne studied himself as a way of drawing out his own inner nature and that of men and women in general. The <i>Essays</i> are among the most idiosyncratic and personal works in all literature and provide an engaging insight into a wise Renaissance mind, continuing to give pleasure and enlightenment to modern readers.<br /><br />With its extensive introduction and notes, M.A. Screech's edition of Montaigne is widely regarded as the most distinguished of recent times.<br /><br />Michel de Montaigne (1533-1586) studied law and spent a number of years working as a counsellor before devoting his life to reading, writing and reflection.<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>The Complete Essays</i>, you might like Francois Rabelais's <i>Gargantua and Pantagruel</i>, also available in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />'Screech's fine version ... must surely serve as the definitive English Montaigne'<br />A.C. Grayling, <i>Financial Times</i><br /><br />'A superb edition'<br />Nicholas Wollaston, <i>Observer</i>",

    "description": "\"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\" is many things: the story of a marriage that mysteriously collapses; a jeremiad against the superficiality of contemporary politics; an investigation of painfully suppressed memories of war; a bildungsroman about a compassionate young man's search for his own identity as well as that of his nation. All of Murakami's storytelling genius -- combining elements of detective fiction, deadpan humor, and metaphysical truth, and swiftly transforming commonplace realism into surreal revelation -- is on full, seamless display. And in turning his literary imagination loose on a broad social and political canvas, he bares nothing less than the soul of a country steeped in the violence of the 20th century.",

    "description": "A brilliantly written, funny, honest, inspiring, and downright astonishing report from the line where death meets life which will surely take its place in the annals of classic adventure stories.<br /><br />One of the most extraordinary survival stories ever told -- Aron Ralston's searing account of his six days trapped in one of the most remote spots in America, and how one inspired act of bravery brought him home. <br /><br />It started out as a simple hike in the Utah canyonlands on a warm Saturday afternoon. For Aron Ralston, a twenty-seven-year-old mountaineer and outdoorsman, a walk into the remote Blue John Canyon was a chance to get a break from a winter of solo climbing Colorado's highest and toughest peaks. He'd earned this weekend vacation, and though he met two charming women along the way, by early afternoon he finally found himself in his element: alone, with just the beauty of the natural world all around him. <br /><br />It was 2:41 P.M. Eight miles from his truck, in a deep and narrow slot canyon, Aron was climbing down off a wedged boulder when the rock suddenly, and terrifyingly, came loose. Before he could get out of the way, the falling stone pinned his right hand and wrist against the canyon wall. <br /><br />And so began six days of hell for Aron Ralston. With scant water and little food, no jacket for the painfully cold nights, and the terrible knowledge that he'd told no one where he was headed, he found himself facing a lingering death -- trapped by an 800-pound boulder 100 feet down in the bottom of a canyon. As he eliminated his escape options one by one through the days, Aron faced the full horror of his predicament: By the time any possible search and rescue effort would begin, he'd most probably have died of dehydration, if a flash flood didn't drown him before that. <br /><br />What does one do in the face of almost certain death? Using the video camera from his pack, Aron began recording his grateful good-byes to his family and friends all over the country, thinking back over a life filled with adventure, and documenting a last will and testament with the hope that someone would find it. (For their part, his family and friends had instigated a major search for Aron, the amazing details of which are also documented here for the first time.) The knowledge of their love kept Aron Ralston alive, until a divine inspiration on Thursday morning solved the riddle of the boulder. Aron then committed the most extreme act imaginable to save himself. <br /><br />Between a Rock and a Hard Place -- a brilliantly written, funny, honest, inspiring, and downright astonishing report from the line where death meets life -- will surely take its place in the annals of classic adventure stories.",

    "description": "Welcome to Neo-Tokyo, built on the ashes of a Tokyo annihilated by a blast of unknown origin that triggered World War III. The lives of two streetwise teenage friends, Tetsuo and Kaneda, change forever when paranormal abilities begin to waken in Tetsuo, making him a target for a shadowy agency that will stop at nothing to prevent another catastrophe like the one that leveled Tokyo. At the core of the agency\u2019s motivation is a raw, all-consuming fear of an unthinkable, monstrous power known only as Akira.<br /><br />Katsuhiro Otomo\u2019s stunning science fiction masterpiece is considered by many to be the finest work of graphic fiction ever produced, and Otomo\u2019s brilliant animated film version is regarded worldwide as a classic.<br /><br />This edition includes a new foreword from the author and a postscript from Dark Horse publisher Mike Richardson!",

At the forefront of that movement were six innovative and daring directors whose films pushed the boundaries of moviemaking and announced to the world that something exciting was happening in Hollywood. <br /><br />Sharon Waxman of the <em>New York Times</em> spent the decade covering these young filmmakers, and in <em>Rebels on the Backlot</em> she weaves together the lives and careers of Quentin Tarantino, <em>Pulp Fiction</em>; Steven Soderbergh, <em>Traffic</em>; David Fincher, <em>Fight Club</em>; Paul Thomas Anderson, <em>Boogie Nights</em>; David O. Russell, <em>Three Kings</em>; and Spike Jonze, <em>Being John Malkovich</em>.",

Introduce your students to the kinds of characters they will surely meet in life through the entertaining and exaggerated stories of the Greek gods. You will want to read it to your family first and then let your children read the stories again and again. The beautiful artwork is a wonderful teaching tool that allows you to ask questions about each detail. Greek myths are timeless and universal stories that serve as archetypes for the human character and the search for the divine.\n    \n    This is an ideal beginning book for your child\u2019s classical education journey, regardless of age! Superbly written and illustrated, this classic introduces timeless tales that have enchanted people for thousands of years. Because they are everywhere in Western art and literature, Greek myths are the essential background for a classical education. You can hardly read Shakespeare without them!\n    \n    Each of the 30 lessons in the Student Guide presents important facts to know, vocabulary, comprehension questions, and a picture review and activities section. It also points out the many references to Greek mythology in the modern world.\n    \n    More information: http://www.memoriapress.com/curriculum/classical-studies/daulaires-greek-myths",

Her apocalyptic vision of life is expressed through grotesque, often comic situations in which the principal character faces a problem of salvation: the grandmother, in the title story, confronting the murderous Misfit; a neglected four-year-old boy looking for the Kingdom of Christ in the fast-flowing waters of the river; General Sash, about to meet the final enemy. Stories include:<br /><br />\"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\"<br />\"The River\"<br />\"The Life You Save May Be Your Own\"<br />\"A Stroke of Good Fortune\"<br />\"A Temple of the Holy Ghost\"<br />\"The Artificial Nigger\"<br />\"A Circle in the Fire\"<br />\"A Late Encounter with the Enemy\"<br />\"Good Country People\"<br />\"The Displaced Person\"<br />\u00a91955 Flannery O'Connor; 1954, 1953, 1948 by Flannery O'Connor; renewed 1983, 1981 by Regina O'Connor; renewed 1976 by Mrs. Edward F.

Ages 12-up.<br /><br />Josh Swensen is not your average 17-year-old. At the age of two, he was figuring out algebraic equations with colored magnetic numbers. He is a prodigy who only wants to make the world a better place. Josh\u2019s wish comes true when his virtual alter ego, Larry, becomes a huge media sensation. Larry has his own Web site where he posts sermons on anti-consumerism and has a large following of adults and teens. Meanwhile, Larry\u2019s identity is a mystery to everyone. While it seems as if the whole world is trying to figure out Larry\u2019s true identity, Josh feels trapped inside his own creation. What will happen to the world, and to Larry, if he is exposed?",

    "description": "First published in 1960, <i>The Violent Bear It Away</i> is now a landmark in American literature. It is a dark and absorbing example of the Gothic sensibility and bracing satirical voice that are united in Flannery O'Conner's work. In it, the orphaned Francis Marion Tarwater and his cousins, the schoolteacher Rayber, defy the prophecy of their dead uncle--that Tarwater will become a prophet and will baptize Rayber's young son, Bishop. A series of struggles ensues: Tarwater fights an internal battle against his innate faith and the voices calling him to be a prophet while Rayber tries to draw Tarwater into a more \"reasonable\" modern world. Both wrestle with the legacy of their dead relatives and lay claim to Bishop's soul.<br /><br />O'Connor observes all this with an astonishing combination of irony and compassion, humor and pathos, resulting in a novel where range and depth reveal a brilliant and innovative writers acutely alert to where the sacred lives and to where it does not.",

    "description": "An immediate national bestseller, <i>Hegemony or Survival</i> demonstrates how, for more than half a century the United States has been pursuing a grand imperial strategy with the aim of staking out the globe. Our leaders have shown themselves willing-as in the Cuban missile crisis-to follow the dream of dominance no matter how high the risks. World-renowned intellectual Noam Chomsky investigates how we came to this perilous moment and why our rulers are willing to jeopardize the future of our species.<br /><br />With the striking logic that is his trademark, Chomsky tracks the U.S. government's aggressive pursuit of \"full spectrum dominance\" and vividly lays out how the most recent manifestations of the politics of global control-from unilateralism to the dismantling of international agreements to state terrorism-cohere in a drive for hegemony that ultimately threatens our existence. Lucidly written, thoroughly documented, and featuring a new afterword by the author, <i>Hegemony or Survival </i>is a definitive statement from one of today's most influential thinkers.",

    "description": "In this spectacular work of historical speculation Terry Jones investigates the mystery surrounding the death of Geoffrey Chaucer over 600 years ago. A diplomat and brother-in-law to John of Gaunt, one of the most powerful men in the kingdom, Chaucer was celebrated as his country's finest living poet, rhetorician and scholar: the preeminent intellectual of his time. And yet nothing is known of his death. In 1400 his name simply disappears from the record. We don't know how he died, where or when; there is no official confirmation of his death and no chronicle mentions it; no notice of his funeral or burial. He left no will and there's nothing to tell us what happened to his estate. He didn't even leave any manuscripts. How could this be? What if he was murdered? <br /><br />Terry Jones' hypothesis is the introduction to a reading of Chaucer's writings as evidence that might be held against him, interwoven with a portrait of one of the most turbulent periods in English history, its politics and its personalities.<br />",

    "description": "In this revolutionary expose, Harvard Law School bankruptcy expert Elizabeth Warren and financial consultant Amelia Tyagi show that today's middle-class parents are increasingly trapped by financial meltdowns. Astonishingly, sending mothers to work has made families more vulnerable to financial disaster than ever before. Today's two-income family earns 75% more money than its single-income counterpart of a generation ago, but has 25% less discretionary income to cover living costs. This is \"the rare financial book that sidesteps accusations of individual wastefulness to focus on institutional changes,\" raved the <i>Boston Globe</i>. Warren and Tyagi reveal how the ferocious bidding war for housing and education has silently engulfed America's suburbs, driving up the cost of keeping families in the middle class. The authors show why the usual remedies-child-support enforcement, subsidized daycare, and higher salaries for women-won't solve the problem. But as the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> observed, \"The book is brimming with proposed solutions to the nail-biting anxiety that the middle class finds itself in: subsidized day care, school vouchers, new bank regulation, among other measures.\" From Senator Edward M. Kennedy to Dr. Phil to Bill Moyers, <i>The Two-Income Trap</i> has created a sensation among economists, politicians, and families-all those who care about America's middle-class crisis.",

    "description": "Primo Levi was among the greatest witnesses to twentieth-century atrocity. In this gripping novel, based on a true story, he reveals the extraordinary lives of the Russian, Polish and Jewish partisans trapped behind enemy lines during the Second World War. Wracked by fear, hunger and fierce rivalries, they link up, fall apart, struggle to stay alive and to sabotage the efforts of the all-powerful German army. A compelling tale of action, resistance and epic adventure, it also reveals Levi's characteristic compassion and deep insight into the moral dilemmas of total war. It ranks alongside THE PERIOD TABLE and IF THIS IS A MAN as one of the rare authentic masterpieces of the 20th century.",

Here men from all walks of life don the garb of their fantasies and act them out: a man from the gas company wears the robe and mitre of a bishop; another customer becomes a flagellant judge, and still another a victorious general, while a bank clerk defiles the Virgin mary. These costumed diversions take place while outside a revolution rages which has isolated the brothel from the rest of the rebel-controlled city. In a stunning series of macabre, climactic scenes, Genet presents his caustic view of man and society.",

    "description": "\"I think I could be a good woman, if I had five thousand a year,\" observes beautiful and clever Becky Sharp, one of the wickedest\u2014and most appealing\u2014women in all of literature. Becky is just one of the many fascinating figures that populate William Makepeace Thackeray\u2019s novel <i>Vanity Fair</i>, a wonderfully satirical panorama of upper-middle-class life and manners in London at the beginning of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />Scorned for her lack of money and breeding, Becky must use all her wit, charm and considerable sex appeal to escape her drab destiny as a governess. From London\u2019s ballrooms to the battlefields of Waterloo, the bewitching Becky works her wiles on a gallery of memorable characters, including her lecherous employer, Sir Pitt, his rich sister, Miss Crawley, and Pitt\u2019s dashing son, Rawdon, the first of Becky\u2019s misguided sexual entanglements.<br /><br />Filled with hilarious dialogue and superb characterizations, <i>Vanity Fair</i> is a richly entertaining comedy that asks the reader, \"Which of us is happy in this world? Which of us has his desire? or, having it, is satisfied?\"<br /><br />This edition includes over one hundred original illustrations by Thackeray.",

Moving along the endless prairies, Latour spreads his faith the only way he knows\u2014gently, although he must contend with the unforgiving landscape, derelict and sometimes openly rebellious priests, and his own loneliness. Over nearly\u00a040 years, they leave converts and enemies, crosses, and occasionally ecstasy in their wake. But it takes a death for them to make their mark on the landscape forever.",

So he turns to the only friend he can trust: private investigator Philip Marlowe. Marlowe is willing to help a man down on his luck, but later Lennox commits suicide in Mexico and things start to turn nasty. Marlowe is drawn into a sordid crowd of adulterers and alcoholics in LA's Idle Valley, where the rich are suffering one big suntanned hangover. Marlowe is sure Lennox didn't kill his wife, but how many stiffs will turn up before he gets to the truth?",

    "description": "Jonathan Franzen arrived late, and last, in a family of boys in Webster Groves, Missouri. <i>The Discomfort Zone </i>is his intimate memoir of his growth from a \"small and fundamentally ridiculous person,\" through an adolescence both excruciating and strangely happy, into an adult with embarrassing and unexpected passions. It's also a portrait of a middle-class family weathering the turbulence of the 1970s, and a vivid personal history of the decades in which America turned away from its midcentury idealism and became a more polarized society.<br /><br />The story Franzen tells here draws on elements as varied as the explosive dynamics of a Christian youth fellowship in the 1970s, the effects of Kafka's fiction on his protracted quest to lose his virginity, the elaborate pranks that he and his friends orchestrated from the roof of his high school, his self-inflicted travails in selling his mother's house after her death, and the web of connections between his all-consuming marriage, the problem of global warming, and the life lessons to be learned in watching birds.<br /><br />These chapters of a Midwestern youth and a New York adulthood are warmed by the same combination of comic scrutiny and unqualified affection that characterize Franzen's fiction, but here the main character is the author himself. Sparkling, daring, arrestingly honest, <i>The Discomfort Zone </i>narrates the formation of a unique mind and heart in the crucible of an everyday American family.<br />",

    "description": "A fateful mistake... Stepping into the wrong carriage at a Sussex village, Elinor Rochdale is swept up in a thrilling and dangerous adventure. Elinor is rather surprised that her prospective employer is quite rich, and more so at tile decayed grandeur of the house to which she is transported. Elinor thought she was entering Highnoons as a governess, but Eduard Carlyon, the handsomely fashionable gentleman who carefully interviewed her obviously needed no governess. Carlyon was seeking a wife-not for himself, but for his young cousin, Eustace Cheviot, the dissipated and profligate owner of the ruined estate, who now lay on his deathbed. Surprised and repulsed as she was by this strange proposal, Elinor was nevertheless unable to resist Carlyon and his mystifying plans. Ned persuades Elinor to marry his cousin as a simple business arrangement.<br /><br />A momentous decision... And so in the short span of a few hours would-be governess became a bride - and a widow almost as soon as the ring is on her finger. Even as she assumed the duties of mistress of Highnoons, even as she tried to solve the puzzle that placed her in this unusual situation, Elinor found herself inextricably- drawn to Ned Carlyon, the aloof, caustic man who treated her with nothing more than cousinly respect - the last thing that spirited Elinor wanted.... As partner in a secret conspiracy to save a family's name she finds herself embroiled with uninvited guests, housebreakers, missing government papers, an Napoleonic spy ring, and a shocking murder. And mysterious conspirator Lord Carlyon won't let her leave....",

    "description": "The Groom. Enormously wealthy, scrupulously mannered and suffocatingly confined by his title the 24 years old Adolphus Gillespie Ware, the 7th Duke of Sale -- known to friends as Gilly -- is a diffident young, easily pushed around by his overprotective uncle and the retinue of devoted family retainers who won't let him lift a finger for himself. He sometimes wishes he could be a commoner and longed for a spot of true excitement. When he learns that his marriage has already been arranged, orphaned Gilly, who is determined to wed for love only, discovers that his intended is the same woman he has secretly loved for years.<br /><br />The Bride. Lovely Harriet Presteigne had already been informed that she was expected to marry diffident Gilly, her old childhood friend. Unfortunately, the thought had never occurred to the groom-to-be until his uncle cum guardian told him. She accepted with reasonable good grace the necessity of carrying on the line. She liked Gilly; she simply didn't love him -- certainly not in the way he dreamed love should be.<br /><br />The adventures. So when Gilly's cousin found himself in quite a pickle -- a beautiful country girl claimed Gideon had proposed! -- Looking for some excitement, Gilly delightfully took it upon himself to remedy the situation with an incognito journey. But his secret foray into the countryside was fraught with danger as well as thrills, he confronts a blackmailer, he encounters a runaway school boy, a beautiful but airheaded orphan, appealing and well-spoken comic villains, and a series of alarming and even life threatening events from which he can extricate himself only with the help of his fianc\u00e9e\u2026 In night Gilly brought to Harriet's home Belinda Ware, a beautiful young \"foundling,\" asking his fiancee's help in hiding her from her \"pursuers.\" It was as fantastic a story as Harriet had ever heard --a situation which showed the seemingly gentle Gilly in quite another light....",

    "description": "With his trademark elegance and intelligence Robert Harris recreates a world on the brink of disaster.<br /><br />All along the Mediterranean coast, the Roman empire's richest citizens are relaxing in their luxurious villas, enjoying the last days of summer. The world's largest navy lies peacefully at anchor in Misenum. The tourists are spending their money in the seaside resorts of Baiae, Herculaneum, and Pompeii.<br /><br />But the carefree lifestyle and gorgeous weather belie an impending cataclysm, and only one man is worried. The young engineer Marcus Attilius Primus has just taken charge of the Aqua Augusta, the enormous aqueduct that brings fresh water to a quarter of a million people in nine towns around the Bay of Naples. His predecessor has disappeared. Springs are failing for the first time in generations. And now there is a crisis on the Augusta's sixty-mile main line\u2014somewhere to the north of Pompeii, on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius.<br /><br />Attilius\u2014decent, practical, and incorruptible\u2014promises Pliny, the famous scholar who commands the navy, that he can repair the aqueduct before the reservoir runs dry. His plan is to travel to Pompeii and put together an expedition, then head out to the place where he believes the fault lies. But Pompeii proves to be a corrupt and violent town, and Attilius soon discovers that there are powerful forces at work\u2014both natural and man-made\u2014threatening to destroy him.<br /><br />With his trademark elegance and intelligence, Robert Harris, bestselling author of Archangel and Fatherland, re-creates a world on the brink of disaster.",

    "description": "When Tiro, the confidential secretary (and slave) of a Roman senator, opens the door to a terrified stranger on a cold November morning, he sets in motion a chain of events that will eventually propel his master into one of the most suspenseful courtroom dramas in history. The stranger is a Sicilian, a victim of the island's corrupt Roman governor, Verres. The senator is Marcus Cicero -- an ambitious young lawyer and spellbinding orator, who at the age of twenty-seven is determined to attain <i>imperium</i> -- supreme power in the state. <br /><br /> Of all the great figures of the Roman world, none was more fascinating or charismatic than Cicero. And Tiro -- the inventor of shorthand and author of numerous books, including a celebrated biography of his master (which was lost in the Dark Ages) -- was always by his side. <br /><br /> Compellingly written in Tiro's voice, <i>Imperium</i> is the re-creation of his vanished masterpiece, recounting in vivid detail the story of Cicero's quest for glory, competing with some of the most powerful and intimidating figures of his -- or any other -- age: Pompey, Caesar, Crassus, and the many other powerful Romans who changed history. <br /><br /> Robert Harris, the world's master of innovative historical fiction, lures us into a violent, treacherous world of Roman politics at once exotically different from and yet startlingly similar to our own -- a world of Senate intrigue and electoral corruption, special prosecutors and political adventurism -- to describe how one clever, compassionate, devious, vulnerable man fought to reach the top.<br /><br />Page Numbers Source ISBN: 0099406314",

    "description": "\"The most controversial, explosive, and important book yet from the renowned author and critic.\" Harold Bloom uses his unsurpassed skills to examine the character of Jesus: the inconsistencies, the contradictions, and the Gospels' flaws of logic. He also explores the character of Yahweh, who Bloom argues has more in common with Mark's Jesus than he does with God the Father of the Christian and rabbinic Jewish traditions. In fact, Bloom asserts, the Hebrew Bible of the Jews and the Christian Old Testament are very different books with very different purposes. At a time when religion has taken center stage in the political arena, Bloom's controversial examination of the incompatible Judeo-Christian traditions will make readers rethink everything they take for granted about what they believe is a shared heritage.",

    "description": "First published in 1919, <i>Within a Budding Grove</i> was awarded the Prix Goncourt, bringing the author immediate fame. In this second volume of <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>, the narrator turns from the childhood reminiscences of <i>Swann\u2019s Way</i> to memories of his adolescence. Having gradually become indifferent to Swann\u2019s daughter Gilberte, the narrator visits the seaside resort of Balbec with his grandmother and meets a new object of attention\u2014Albertine, \u201ca girl with brilliant, laughing eyes and plump, matt cheeks.\u201d<br /><br />For this authoritative English-language edition, D. J. Enright has revised the late Terence Kilmartin\u2019s acclaimed reworking of C. K. Scott Moncrieff\u2019s translation to take into account the new definitive French editions of <i>\u00c1 la recherch\u00e9 du temps perdu</i> (the final volume of these new editions was published by the Biblioth\u00e8que de la Pl\u00e9iade in 1989).",

          "description": "With <b>\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu</b> / <b>In Search of Lost Time</b> Proust attempted the perfect rendering of life in art, of the past recreated through memory. It is both a portrait of the artist and a discovery of the aesthetic by which the portrait is painted, and it was to have an immense influence on the literature of the twentieth century.\n    \n    The novel contains seven volumes:\n    <b>1 - Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de chez Swann</b> (1913): Swann's Way / The Way by Swann's\n    (Part I: Combray / Overture. Part II: Un Amour de Swann / Swann in Love. Part III : Noms de pays: le nom / Names of places: the name)\n    <b>2 - \u00c0 l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs</b> (1919): In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower / Within a Budding Grove\n    <b>3 - Le C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Guermantes</b> (1920-1921): The Guermantes Way \n    <b>4 - Sodome et Gomorrhe</b> (1921-1922): Sodom and Gomorrah / Cities of the Plain\n    <b>5 - La Prisonni\u00e8re</b> (1923): The Prisoner / The Captive\n    <b>6 - Albertine disparue / La Fugitive</b> (1925): Albertine Gone / The Fugitive / The Sweet Cheat Gone\n    <b>7 - Le Temps retrouv\u00e9</b> (1927): Time Regained / The Past Recaptured / Finding Time Again\n    \n    The novel is being adapted as a <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/65593-remembrance-of-things-past-graphic-novel-adaptation\">graphic novel</a> by [author:St\u00e9phane Heuet|119580].\n    \n    <b>In Search of Lost Time</b> is Marcel Proust\u2019s masterpiece, known for its length and the notion of involuntary memory, the most famous example being the \"episode of the madeleine\". The complete story contains nearly 1.5 million words and is one of the longest novels in world literature.\n    \n    <b>\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu</b> is translated as:\n    English: In Search of Lost Time / Remembrance of Things Past*\n    Spanish: En busca del tiempo perdido\n    German: Auf der Suche nach der verlorenen Zeit\n    Portugese: Em Busca do Tempo Perdido\n    Italian: Alla ricerca del tempo perduto\n    Dutch: Op zoek naar de verloren tijd\n    Swedish: P\u00e5 spaning efter den tid som flytt\n    Polish: W poszukiwaniu straconego czasu\n    Turkish: Kay\u0131p Zaman\u0131n \u0130zinde\n    Bulgarian: \u041f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0433\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\n    *In English the novel is widely referred to as <b>Remembrance of Things Past</b> but the title <b>In Search of Lost Time</b>, a literal rendering of the French, has gained in usage since D.J. Enright's adopted it in his 1992 revision of the earlier translation by C.K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin.",

    "description": "Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote his famous \"Meditations\" during his campaigns against the barbarian invaders. Composed among the reeds and mists of the swampy Danube, his private journals record the passing thoughts, maxims, and musings on life and death of a sensitive and humble mind trained in the Stoic philosophy which, to a certain extent, anticipated the development of Christianity. Philosophy was both a religion and a guiding force for Marcus Aurelius. His is a transitional phase of thought in Stoic philosophy, where diffidence and willingness to recognize failure have replaced assurance and self-sufficiency. Instead of the Stoic virtue of pride Marcus Aurelius appears to anticipate Christian humility.<br /><br />This edition also includes a selection of letters between Marcus Aurelius and his tutor, Fronto.",

    "description": "The power and wealth which Seneca the Younger (c.4 B.C. - A.D. 65) acquired as Nero's minister were in conflict with his Stoic beliefs. Nevertheless he was the outstanding figure of his age. The Stoic philosophy which Seneca professed in his writings, later supported by Marcus Aurelius, provided Rome with a passable bridge to Christianity. Seneca's major contribution to Stoicism was to spiritualize and humanize a system which could appear cold and unrealistic.<br /><p>Selected from the <i>Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium,</i> these letters illustrate the upright ideals admired by the Stoics and extol the good way of life as seen from their standpoint. They also reveal how far in advance of his time were many of Seneca's ideas - his disgust at the shows in the arena or his criticism of the harsh treatment of slaves. Philosophical in tone and written in the 'pointed' style of the Latin Silver Age these 'essays in disguise' were clearly aimed by Seneca at posterity.</p>",

The precocious son of a zookeeper, 16-year-old Pi Patel is raised in Pondicherry, India, where he tries on various faiths for size, attracting \"religions the way a dog attracts fleas.\" Planning a move to Canada, his father packs up the family and their menagerie and they hitch a ride on an enormous freighter. After a harrowing shipwreck, Pi finds himself adrift in the Pacific Ocean, trapped on a 26-foot lifeboat with a wounded zebra, a spotted hyena, a seasick orangutan, and a 450-pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker (\"His head was the size and color of the lifebuoy, with teeth\"). It sounds like a colorful setup, but these wild beasts don't burst into song as if co-starring in an anthropomorphized Disney feature. After much gore and infighting, Pi and Richard Parker remain the boat's sole passengers, drifting for 227 days through shark-infested waters while fighting hunger, the elements, and an overactive imagination. In rich, hallucinatory passages, Pi recounts the harrowing journey as the days blur together, elegantly cataloging the endless passage of time and his struggles to survive: \"It is pointless to say that this or that night was the worst of my life. I have so many bad nights to choose from that I've made none the champion.\" <br /><br />The protagonist Piscine \"Pi\" Molitor Patel, an Indian boy from Pondicherry, explores the issues of religion and spirituality from an early age and survives 227 days shipwrecked in the Pacific Ocean.",

Of <i>The Dream Songs</i>, A. Alvarez wrote in <i>The Observer</i>, \"A major achievement<i>. </i>He has written an elegy on his brilliant generation and, in the process, he has also written an elegy on himself.\"<br /><br />The Dream Songs are eighteen-line poems in three stanzas. Each individual poem is lyric and organized around an emotion provoked by an everyday event. The tone of the poems is less surreal than associational or intoxicated. The principal character of the song cycle is Henry, who is both the narrator of the poems and referred to by the narrator in the poems.</p>",

    "description": "The teen years are full of challenges.<br /><br />For gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered, and questioning teens, these challenges can include prejudice, discrimination, rejection, reprisals, insensitive remarks (even among friends and families) and, sometimes, violence.<br /><br />But being a GLBTQ teen can also be fun and enlightening\u2014when you are comfortable with who you are.<br /><br />Author Kelly Huegel understands what GLBT teens want and need to know. As a teen, she struggled to realize and accept her own identity. Her frank, sensitive book is written for teens who are beginning to question their sexual or gender identity, those who interested in GLBT issues and rights, and those who need guidance, reassurance, or reminders that they aren\u2019t alone.<br /><br />Kelly offers practical advice, knowing encouragement, accessible resources, and real-life testimonials from teens who\u2019ve \"been there.\" Topics include coming out (the pluses and minuses), facing prejudice and pressure, getting support, navigating relationships, staying safe, making healthy choices, surviving and thriving in high school, and more.<br /><br />The message throughout is strong and clear: By accepting yourself, you take charge of your own future.<br /><br />Created with feedback and suggestions from individuals at PFLAG (Parents, families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), GLSEN (the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network), GLAAD (the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation), and other organizations, this book is for any GLBTQ teen\u2014and any straight friend, parent, teacher, counselor, youth leader, or other adult who cares and wants to understand.",

    "description": "From one of Japan's greatest modern writers comes an exquisitely disturbing novel of sexual combat and concealed passion, a work that distills beauty, longing, and loathing into an intoxicating poisoned cocktail. An aging, embittered novelist sets out to avenge himself on the women who have betrayed him. He finds the perfect instrument in Yuichi, a young man whose beauty makes him irresistible to women but who is just discovering his attraction to other men.<br /><br />As Yuichi's mentor presses him into a loveless marriage and a series of equally loveless philanderings, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 enters the gay underworld of postwar Japan. In that hidden society of parks and tearooms, prostitutes and aristocratic blackmailers, Yuichi is as defenseless as any of the women he preys on. Mordantly observed, intellectually provocative, and filled with icy eroticism, <i>Forbidden Colors</i> is a masterpiece.",

    "description": "It is commonly agreed by linguists and anthropologists that the majority of languages spoken now around the globe will likely disappear within our lifetime. The phenomenon known as language death has started to accelerate as the world has grown smaller.<br /><br />This extinction of languages, and the knowledge therein, has no parallel in human history. K. David Harrison's book is the first to focus on the essential question, what is lost when a language dies? What forms of knowledge are embedded in a language's structure and vocabulary? And how harmful is it to humanity that such knowledge is lost forever?<br /><br />Harrison spans the globe from Siberia, to North America, to the Himalayas and elsewhere, to look at the human knowledge that is slowly being lost as the languages that express it fade from sight. He uses fascinating anecdotes and portraits of some of these languages' last remaining speakers, in order to demonstrate that this knowledge about ourselves and the world is inherently precious and once gone, will be lost forever. This knowledge is not only our cultural heritage (oral histories, poetry, stories, etc.) but very useful knowledge about plants, animals, the seasons, and other aspects of the natural world--not to mention our understanding of the capacities of the human mind. Harrison's book is a testament not only to the pressing issue of language death, but to the remarkable span of human knowledge and ingenuity. It will fascinate linguists, anthropologists, and general readers.<br />",

In order to help create that community, YA authors David Levithan and Billy Merrell have collected original poems, essays, and stories by young adults in their teens and early 20s. <i>The Full Spectrum </i>includes a variety of writers\u2014gay, lesbian, bisexual, straight, transitioning, and questioning\u2014on a variety of subjects: coming out, family, friendship, religion/faith, first kisses, break-ups, and many others. <br /><br />This one of a kind collection will, perhaps, help all readers see themselves and the world around them in ways they might never have imagined. We have partnered with the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) and a portion of the proceeds from this book will be donated to them.",

    "description": "Fans of Latin American literature will be thrilled by Oxford University Press's new translations of works by 19th-century Brazilian author Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis. His novels are both heartbreaking and comic; his limning of a colonial Brazil in flux is both perceptive and remarkably modern. <i>The Posthumous Memoirs of Br\u00e1s Cubas</i> is written as an autobiography, a chronicle of the erotic misadventures of its narrator, Br\u00e1s Cubas--who happens to be dead. In pursuit of love and progeny, Cubas rejects the women who want him and aspires to the ones who reject him. In the end, he dies unloved and without heirs, yet he somehow manages to turn this bitter pill into a victory of sorts. What makes <i>Memoirs</i> stand up 100 years after the book was written is Machado's biting humor, brilliant prose, and profound understanding of all the vagaries of human behavior.",

A world where everything is comfortable and familiar - a world where everything is the same. No colour, no music. In such a world, Jonas is selected to be the next Receiver of Memory and is apprenticed to the Giver, an old man who stores memories from the Community\u2019s past.

    "description": "Kids who get called the worst names oftentimes find each other. That's how it was with us. Skeezie Tookis and Addie Carle and Joe Bunch and me. We call ourselves the Gang of Five, but there are only four of us. We do it to keep people on their toes. Make 'em wonder. Or maybe we do it because we figure that there's one more kid out there who's going to need a gang to be a part of. A misfit, like us.<br /><br />Skeezie, Addie, Joe, and Bobby -- they've been friends forever. They laugh together, have lunch together, and get together once a week at the Candy Kitchen to eat ice cream and talk about important issues. Life isn't always fair, but at least they have each other -- and all they really want to do is survive the seventh grade.<br /><br />That turns out to be more of a challenge than any of them had anticipated. Starting with Addie's refusal to say the Pledge of Allegiance and her insistence on creating a new political party to run for student council, the Gang of Five is in for the ride of their lives. Along the way they will learn about politics and popularity, love and loss, and what it means to be a misfit. After years of getting by, they are given the chance to stand up and be seen -- not as the one-word jokes their classmates have tried to reduce them to, but as the full, complicated human beings they are just beginning to discover they truly are.",

They evoke E.B. White's life in New York and in Maine at every stage of his life. They are full of memorable characters: White's family, the New Yorker staff and contributors, literary types and show business people, farmers from Maine and sophisticates from New York\u2013Katherine S. White, Harold Ross, James Thurber, Alexander Woolcott, Groucho Marx, John Updike, and many, many more.<br /><br />Each decade has its own look and taste and feel. Places, too\u2013from Belgrade (Maine) to Turtle Bay (NYC) to the S.S. Buford, Alaska\u2013bound in 1923\u2013are brought to life in White's descriptions. There is no other book of letters to compare with this; it is a book to treasure and savor at one's leisure.<br /><br />As White wrote in this book, \"A man who publishes his letters becomes nudist\u2013nothing shields him from the world's gaze except his bare skin....a man who has written a letter is stuck with it for all time.\"",

The critical periods of James's life are highlighted to illuminate the development of his philosophical and psychological thought.<br /><br /> The anthology features representive selections from <i>The Principles of Psychology, The Will to Believe</i>, and <i>The Variety of Religious Experience</i> in addition to the complete <i>Essays in Radical Empiricism</i> and <i>A Pluralistic Universe</i>. The original 1907 edition of <i>Pragmatism</i> is included, as well as classic selections from all of James's other major works. Of particular significance for James scholarship is the supplemented version of Ralph Barton Perry's <i>Annotated Bibliography of the Writings of William James</i>, with additions bringing it up to 1976.",

    "description": "Patterson and Ledwidge introduce a new hero in an exciting thriller set in the heart of Manhattan. NYPD detective Michael Bennett is concentrating on getting his family through a particularly difficult Christmas: he and his 10 adopted children are facing the loss to cancer of his brave wife, Maeve. But a major crisis calls him away: the funeral of a former First Lady at St. Patrick's Cathedral goes horribly awry when men storm the church and take hundreds of attendees hostage. Michael is asked to try to reason with a sinister man named Jack. Jack releases all but the most famous people, and makes his demands: he wants several million dollars from each celebrity hostage, including the mayor, a popular comedic actor, a beloved talk show host, and a pop starlet. Once Jack starts killing, Michael realizes he's up against a truly diabolical foe. Patterson has a knack for creating genuinely likable heroes, and Michael fits the bill. As readers rapidly turn the pages to learn how the tense hostage drama plays out, they will also be sympathizing with Michael as he faces the agonizing loss of his wife. Totally gripping and downright impossible to put down, this is a promising start to a potential new series.",

    "description": "Thom Jones made his literary debut in The New Yorker in 1991. Within six months his stories appeared in Harper's, Esquire, Mirabella, Story, Buzz, and in The New Yorker twice more. \"The Pugilist at Rest\" - the title story from this stunning collection - took first place in Prize Stories 1993: The O. Henry Awards and was selected for inclusion in Best American Short Stories 1992. He is a writer of astonishing talent. Jones's stories - whether set in the combat zones of Vietnam or the brittle social and intellectual milieu of an elite New England college, whether recounting the poignant last battles of an alcoholic ex-fighter or the hallucinatory visions of an American wandering lost in Bombay in the aftermath of an epileptic fugue - are fueled by an almost brutal vision of the human condition, in a world without mercy or redemption. Physically battered, soul-sick, and morally exhausted, Jones's characters are yet unable to concede defeat: his stories are infused with the improbable grace of the spirit that ought to collapse, but cannot. For in these extraordinary pieces of fiction, it is not goodness that finally redeems us, but the heart's illogical resilience, and the ennobling tenacity with which we cling to each other and to our lives. The publication of The Pugilist at Rest is a major literary event, heralding the arrival of an electrifying new voice in American fiction, and a writer of magnificent depth and range. With these eleven stories, Thom Jones takes his place among the ranks of this country's most important authors.",

    "description": "<i>Smart Mobs</i> takes us on a journey around the world for a preview of the next techno-cultural shift. The coming wave, says Rheingold, is the result of super-efficient mobile communications-cellular phones, wireless-paging, and Internet-access devices-that will allow us to connect with anyone, anytime, anywhere.Rheingold offers a penetrating perspective on the new convergence of pop culture, cutting-edge technology, and social activism. He also reminds us that the real impact of mobile communications will come not from the technology itself but from how people use it, resist it, and adapt to it.",

The original volume remains a central point of reference, and a focus of controversy, with its impact extending into linguistic theory, philosophy of mind, and epistemology. Addressing a central question--what it is for words to mean what they do--and featuring a previously uncollected, additional essay, this work will appeal to a wide audience of philosophers, linguists, and psychologists.<br />",

    "description": "\"Here is a human being speaking with calm and sanity out of the wilderness. We would do well to hear him.\"\u2014The Washington Post Book World<br /><br />Art of the Commonplace gathers twenty essays by Wendell Berry that offer an agrarian alternative to our dominant urban culture. Grouped around five themes\u2014an agrarian critique of culture, agrarian fundamentals, agrarian economics, agrarian religion, and geo-biography\u2014these essays promote a clearly defined and compelling vision important to all people dissatisfied with the stress, anxiety, disease, and destructiveness of contemporary American culture.<br /><br />Why is agriculture becoming culturally irrelevant, and at what cost? What are the forces of social disintegration and how might they be reversed? How might men and women live together in ways that benefit both? And, how does the corporate takeover of social institutions and economic practices contribute to the destruction of human and natural environments?<br /><br />Through his staunch support of local economies, his defense of farming communities, and his call for family integrity, Berry emerges as the champion of responsibilities and priorities that serve the health, vitality and happiness of the whole community of creation.<br />",

    "description": "Leo Tolstoy's classic story of doomed love is one of the most admired novels in world literature. Generations of readers have been enthralled by his magnificent heroine, the unhappily married Anna Karenina, and her tragic affair with dashing Count Vronsky. Maggie Gyllenhaal (The Dark Knight, The Honourable Woman) cites Tolstoy's epic as one of her favorite books of all time, and her love for the literature permeates her performance. Anna Karenina is a masterpiece not only because of the unforgettable woman at its core and the stark drama of her fate but also because it explores and illuminates the deepest questions about how to live a fulfilled life.",

    "description": "'I really think I have done it ingeniously and with a very complicated interweaving of truth and fiction.' So wrote Dickens of David Copperfield (1850), the novel he called his 'favourite child'. Through his hero Dickens draws openly on his own life, as David Copperfield recalls his experiences from childhood to the discovery of his vocation as a successful novelist. Rosa Dartle, Dora, Steerforth and Uriah Heep are among the characters who focus the hero's sexual and emotional drives, and Mr Micawber, a portrait of Dickens's own father, evokes the mixture of love, nostalgia and guilt that, put together, make this Dickens's most quoted and best-loved novel.",

    "description": "In <em>I Love Dick</em>, Chris Kraus, author of <em>Aliens &amp; Anorexia, Torpor</em>, and <em>Video Green</em>, boldly tears away the veil that separates fiction from reality and privacy from self-expression. It's no wonder that upon its publication in 1997, <em>I Love Dick</em> instantly elicited violent controversies and attracted a host of passionate admirers. The story is gripping enough: in 1994 a married failed independent filmmaker who is about to turn forty falls in love with a well-known art and culture theorist named Dick and endeavors to seduce him with the help of her husband, a defiantly unconventional French academic with whom she hasn't had sex in a very long time.<br /><br />But when the theorist refuses to answer her letters, husband and wife continue the correspondence for each other instead, imagining the fling the wife wishes to have with Dick. What follows is a breathless pursuit that takes the woman across America and away from her husband and far beyond her original infatuation into a discovery of the transformative power of first-person narrative. <br /><br /><em>I Love Dick</em> is a manifesto for a new kind of feminist who isn't afraid to burn through her own narcissism in order to assume responsibility for herself and for the injustice in the world, and it's a book you won't put down until the author's final, heroic acts of self-revelation and transformation.",

The punch-now legendary in the annals of American sports-radically changed the trajectory of both men's lives and reverberates throughout the National Basketball Association to this day. Feinstein's compelling investigation of this single cataclysmic incident and its aftermath casts a light on the NBA's darkest secrets, revealing the true price men pay when they choose a career in sports.",

Of those who made the journey, Shedemai alone has survived the hundred of years since the Children of Wetchik returned to Earth.<br /><br />She now wears the Cloak of the Starmaster, and the Oversoul wakes her sometimes to watch over her descendants on the planet below. The population has grown rapidly--there are cities and nations now, whole peoples descended from the who followed Nafai or Elemak.<br /><br />But in all the long years of watching and searching, the Oversoul has not found the thing it sought. It has not found the Keeper of the Earth, the central intelligence that also can repair the Oversoul's damaged programming.<br /></div>",

Now, mankind survives on the planet of Harmony, where the Oversoul--an artificial intelligence--protects them from their own worst impulses. There are no wars, no dangerous technologies or weapons of mass destruction.\n    \n    But after so many millennia, the Oversoul is beginning to fail. Now, a group of humans must return to Earth and seek advice from the entity on which the Oversoul is modeled--the mysterious Keeper of the Earth.\n    \n    http://us.macmillan.com/series/HomecomingSaga",

Phoebe Hoban's Basquiat, the first biography of this charismatic figure, charts the trajectory from the artist's troubled childhood to his volatile passage through the white art world of dealers and nouveau-riche collectors, chronicling the meteoric success and overnight burnout that made him an instant art-world myth.<br /><br />As much the portrait of an era as the portrait of an artist, Basquiat is an incisive expose of the eighties art market that paints a vivid picture of the rise and fall of the graffiti movement, the East Village art scene, and the out-of-control auction houses. Ten years after the artist's death, Basquiat resurrects both the painter and his time.",

It's on the site.\" Pierce has just moved into a new apartment, and he's been \"chasing the dime\"--doing all it takes so his company comes out first with a scientific breakthrough worth millions. But he can't get the messages for Lilly out of his head. As Pierce tries to help a woman he has never met, he steps into a world of escorts, websites, sex, and secret passions. A world where his success and expertise mean nothing...and where he becomes the chief suspect in a murder case, trapped in the fight of his life.",

Now, once again, Daniel Goleman has written a groundbreaking synthesis of the latest findings in biology and brain science, revealing that we are \u201cwired to connect\u201d and the surprisingly deep impact of our relationships on every aspect of our lives.<br /><br />Far more than we are consciously aware, our daily encounters with parents, spouses, bosses, and even strangers shape our brains and affect cells throughout our bodies\u2014down to the level of our genes\u2014for good or ill. In <b>Social Intelligence</b>, Daniel Goleman explores an emerging new science with startling implications for our interpersonal world. Its most fundamental discovery: we are designed for sociability, constantly engaged in a \u201cneural ballet\u201d that connects us brain to brain with those around us.<br /><br />Our reactions to others, and theirs to us, have a far-reaching biological impact, sending out cascades of hormones that regulate everything from our hearts to our immune systems, making good relationships act like vitamins\u2014and bad relationships like poisons. We can \u201ccatch\u201d other people\u2019s emotions the way we catch a cold, and the consequences of isolation or relentless social stress can be life-shortening. Goleman explains the surprising accuracy of first impressions, the basis of charisma and emotional power, the complexity of sexual attraction, and how we detect lies. He describes the \u201cdark side\u201d of social intelligence, from narcissism to Machiavellianism and psychopathy. He also reveals our astonishing capacity for \u201cmindsight,\u201d as well as the tragedy of those, like autistic children, whose mindsight is impaired.<br /><br />Is there a way to raise our children to be happy? What is the basis of a nourishing marriage? How can business leaders and teachers inspire the best in those they lead and teach? How can groups divided by prejudice and hatred come to live together in peace? <br /><br />The answers to these questions may not be as elusive as we once thought. And Goleman delivers his most heartening news with powerful conviction: we humans have a built-in bias toward empathy, cooperation, and altruism\u2013provided we develop the social intelligence to nurture these capacities in ourselves and others.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",

Beautiful, fearless, tormented, at forty-five she has lived a life of lovers and adventures. Now, Dalva begins a journey that will take her back to the bosom of her family, to the half-Sioux lover of her youth, and to a pioneering great-grandfather whose journals recount the bloody annihilation of the Plains Indians. On the way, she discovers a story that stretches from East to West, from the Civil War to Wounded Knee and Vietnam -- and finds the balm to heal her wild and wounded soul.",

    "description": "Willa Cather -- born in Back Creek, Virginia, in 1873 -- was nine when she and her family moved to Red Cloud, Nebraska. She grew up on the plains -- and the plains grew into her as she did. This 1913 novel -- the story of an immigrant family's struggle to save their Nebraska farm -- grew out of her and of course, through her: there's a reason that this -- Cather's second novel -- is the famous book it has become. Cather attended the University of Nebraska and worked six years on the editorial staff at McClure's Magazine in New York City; she won the Pulitzer Prize in 1923 for One of Ours.",

    "description": "WINNER OF THE 2008 INTERNATIONAL IMPAC DUBLIN LITERARY PRIZE <br />\"De Niro's Game\" plunges readers into the timely story of two young men caught in Lebanon's civil war. Bassam and George, best friends in childhood, have grown to adulthood in war-torn Beirut. Now they must choose their futures: to stay in the city and consolidate power through crime, or to go into exile abroad, alienated from the only existence they have known. Told in a distinctive, captivating voice that fuses vivid cinematic imagery and page-turning plot with the measured strength and beauty of Arabic poetry, \"De Niro's Game\" is an explosive portrait of life in a war zone, and a powerful meditation on what comes after.",

In dazzling language and startling images, Tour\u00e9 invents a place called Soul City, America\u2019s most miraculous metropolis. In an astonishing array of voices and styles, <i>The Portable Promised Land</i> celebrates the most soulful corners of America while questioning the very nature of Blackness.<br /><br />Among Tour\u00e9\u2019s unforgettable characters are the Right Revren Daddy Love, Brooklyn\u2019s favorite sexually wayward preacher (\u201cA Hot Time at the Church of Kentucky Fried Souls and the Spectacular Final Sunday Sermon of the Right Revren Daddy Love\u201d), a boy with magic Air Jordans that let him fly above the ball court (\u201cFalcon Malone Can Fly No Mo\u201d), a child who can disappear into Romare Bearden paintings (\u201cSolomon\u2019s Big Day: A Children\u2019s Story\u201d), mystified parents who discover their beloved little boy has somehow turned into a little Black Sambo (\u201cThe Sambomorphosis\u201d), and Huggy Bear Jackson, whose 1983 Cadillac Cutlass Supreme custom convertible\u2019s supernatural stereo plays only Stevie Wonder songs (\u201cThe Steviewondermobile\u201d).<br /><br />With a fearlessness and style that recall the work of Langston Hughes and Ralph Ellison, Tour\u00e9 captures, through lyrical rhythms and relentless inventiveness, an America where magic can happen and Black is beautiful. <i>The Portable Promised Land</i> marks the entrance of a new and wildly compelling voice to American fiction.",

Celebrating at a summerhouse in Maine, Leslie Headrick, Madison Appleby, and Ellie Abbott are taking stock of their lives and loves, their wishes and choices. But none of them expect the gift that awaits them at the summerhouse: the chance for each of them to turn their \u201cwhat-might-have-beens\u201d into reality\u2026<br /><br />Leslie, a suburban wife and mother, follows the career of a boy who pursued her in college wonders: what if she had chosen differently? Madison dropped a modeling career to help her high school boyfriend recover from an accident, even though he\u2019d jilted her. But what if she had said \u201cno\u201d when her old boyfriend had called? Ellie became a famous novelist, but a bitter divorce wiped out her earnings\u2014and shattered her belief in herself. Why had the \u201cjustice\u201d system failed her? And could she prevent its happening the second time around?<br /><br />Now, a mysterious \u201cMadame Zoya,\u201d offers each of them a chance to relive any three weeks from the past. Will the road not taken prove a better path? Each woman will have to decide for herself as she follows the dream that got away\u2026and each must choose the life that will truly satisfy the heart\u2019s deepest longings.",

These thirty-four essays, most originally published in Natural History magazine, exemplify the keen insight with which Dr. Gould observes the natural world and convey the infectious enthusiasm for fossils and evolutionary theory that has made his books award-winning, national best-sellers. In his latest musings on evolution and other natural phenomena, Gould reveals the uncanny interconnections among distinctly human creations - museums, literature, music, politics, and culture - encompassing a delightfully, wide range of topics, from giant fossils, fads, and fungus to baseball, beeswax, and blaauwbocks, from a humanistic look at Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Erasmus Darwin's poetry to the fallacies of eugenics and creationism and the moral imperatives of thinking people to meet the ethical challenges that pseudo-science presents.",

    "description": "<b>Featured title on PBS's <i>The Great American Read</i> in 2018</b><br /><br />When <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> was first published in 1891, it evoked a tremendous amount of hostile criticism, in most part due to its immoral content. Oscar Wilde was identified with the \u201cart for art\u2019s sake\u201d movement of the nineteenth century which did not subordinate art to ethical instruction. However, this novel is indeed a morality tale about the hazards of egotistical self-indulgence.<br /><br />\u201cIf it were I,\u201d exclaims Dorian, \u201cwho were always to be young and that picture that was to grow old\u2026I would give my soul for that.\u201d<br /><br />With that spoken, the tale of this young hero of amazing beauty, Dorian Gray, begins. His pact with evil allows his portrait to take on his many sins and degradations while his physical appearance remains youthful. Over the years as he becomes cruel and vicious, even murderous, Dorian\u2019s young and perfect body is no longer enough to salvage his deteriorating mind and morality. Will justice and good prevail?<br /><br />This novel is part of Brilliance Audio\u2019s extensive Classic Collection, bringing you timeless masterpieces that you and your family are sure to love.",

    "description": "In this accessible and comprehensive work, Robert Solomon and Kathleen Higgins cover the entire history of philosophy--ancient, medieval, and modern, from cultures both East and West--in its broader historical and cultural contexts. Major philosophers and movements are discussed along with less well-known but interesting figures. The authors examine the early Greek, Indic, and Chinese philosophers and the mythological traditions that preceded them, as well as the great religious philosophies, including Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, and Taoism. Easily understandable to students without specialized knowledge of philosophy, <em>A Short History of Philosophy</em> demonstrates the relevance of philosophy to our times, illuminating the impact of the revolutions wrought by science, industry, colonialism, and sectarian warfare; the two world wars and the Holocaust; and the responses of philosophy in the schools of existentialism, postmodernism, feminism, and multiculturalism. In addition, the authors provide their own twists and interpretations of events, resulting in a broad view of the nature of philosophy as an intellectual discipline and its sometimes odd and dramatic consequences.<br />",

    "description": "Eight year-old orphan Beth Harmon is quiet, sullen, and by all appearances unremarkable. That is until she plays her first game of chess. Her senses grow sharper, her thinking clearer, and for the first time in her life she feels herself fully in control. By the age of sixteen, she's competing for the U.S. Open championship. But as she hones her skills on the professional circuit, the stakes get higher, her isolation grows more frightening, and the thought of escape becomes all the more tempting. Engaging and fast-paced, <i>The Queen's Gambit</i> speeds to a conclusion as elegant and satisfying as a mate in four.",

    "description": "<i>February House</i> is the uncovered story of an extraordinary experiment in communal living, one involving young but already iconic writers -- and the country's best-known burlesque performer -- in a house at 7 Middagh Street in Brooklyn during 1940 and 1941. It was a fevered yearlong party fueled by the appetites of youth and by the shared sense of urgency to take action as artists in the months before America entered the war.<br /><br />In spite of the sheer intensity of life at 7 Middagh, the house was for its residents a creative crucible. Carson McCullers's two masterpieces, <i>The Member of the Wedding</i> and <i>The Ballad of the Sad Cafe</i>, were born, bibulously, in Brooklyn. Gypsy Rose Lee, workmanlike by day, party girl by night, wrote her book <i>The G-String Murders</i> in her Middagh Street bedroom. Auden -- who along with Britten was being excoriated at home in England for absenting himself from the war -- presided over the house like a peevish auntie, collecting rent money and dispensing romantic advice. And yet all the while he was composing some of the most important work of his career.<br /><br />Sherill Tippins's <i>February House</i>, enlivened by primary sources and an unforgettable story, masterfully recreates daily life at the most fertile and improbable live-in salon of the twentieth century.",

    "description": "Joe Simpson and his climbing partner, Simon Yates, had just reached the top of a 21,000-foot peak in the Andes when disaster struck. Simpson plunged off the vertical face of an ice ledge, breaking his leg. In the hours that followed, darkness fell and a blizzard raged as Yates tried to lower his friend to safety. Finally, Yates was forced to cut the rope, moments before he would have been pulled to his own death.<br />The next three days were an impossibly grueling ordeal for both men. Yates, certain that Simpson was dead, returned to base camp consumed with grief and guilt over abandoning him. Miraculously, Simpson had survived the fall, but crippled, starving, and severely frostbitten was trapped in a deep crevasse. Summoning vast reserves of physical and spiritual strength, Simpson crawled over the cliffs and canyons of the Andes, reaching base camp hours before Yates had planned to leave.<br />How both men overcame the torments of those harrowing days is an epic tale of fear, suffering, and survival, and a poignant testament to unshakable courage and friendship.",

Not so, lately. Four women have disappeared from Cleary over the past two years. And there\u2019s always a blue ribbon left near the spot where each of the women was last seen. There are no bodies, no other clues, and no suspicion as to who their abductor might be. And now, another woman has disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />It is to this backdrop that Lilly Martin returns to close the sale of her mountain cabin, marking the end of her turbulent eight-year marriage to Dutch Burton, Cleary\u2019s chief of police. Dutch\u2019s reluctance to let her go isn\u2019t Lilly\u2019s only obstacle. As she\u2019s trying to outrun a snowstorm, her car skids on the icy road and strikes a man who emerges from the woods on foot. She recognizes the injured man as Ben Tierney, whom she\u2019d met the previous summer. They\u2019re forced to wait out the storm in the cabin, but as the hours of their confinement mount, Lilly begins to wonder if the greatest danger to her safety isn\u2019t the blizzard outside, but the mysterious man right beside her. <br /><br />Is Ben Tierney the feared abductor? Or is he who he claims to be...her rescuer from harm and from the tragedy that haunts her?",

    "description": "In 1975, four teenagers from Mount Temple School in Dublin gathered in a crowded kitchen to discuss forming a band. The drum kit just about fit into the room, the lead guitarist was playing a homemade guitar, the bassist could barely play at all and nobody wanted to sing. Over thirty years later, Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr are still together, bound by intense loyalty, passionate idealism and a relentless belief in the power of rock and roll to change the world.<br /><br />In a epic journey that has taken them from the clubs of Dublin to the stadiums of the world, U2 have sold over 130 million albums, been number one all over the world, revolutionized live performance, spearheaded political campaigns and made music that defines the age we live in.<br /><br />From the anarchic days of their Seventies punk origins through their Eighties ascent to superstardom with the epic rock of 'The Joshua Tree', the dark post-modern ironies of 'Achtung Baby' in the Nineties and their 21st-Century resurgence as rock's biggest and boldest band, this is a tale of faith, love, drama, family, birth, death, survival, conflict, crises, creativity . . . and a lot of laughter.<br /><br />Told with wit, insight and astonishing candour by the band themselves and manager Paul McGuinness, with pictures from their own archives, 'U2 by U2' allows unprecedented access into the inner life of the greatest rock band of our times.",

    "description": "Hip, violent and funny vignettes of the mean streets of southeast London tie together this rowdy set of short novels by Bruen (The Guards), a modern Irish master of the hard-boiled. <br /><br />Collecting <i>A White Arrest</i> (1998), <i>Taming the Alien</i> (1999) and <i>The McDead</i> (2000) for first U.S. publication, this omnibus showcases the investigations of the aging Chief Inspector Roberts and the brutish Detective Sergeant Brant, with the assistance of the unlucky-in-love Woman Police Constable Falls. They don't always solve their assigned crimes, but know perfectly well if they can nail the occasional major criminal-\"the white arrest\"-they'll be able to keep their jobs. Among numerous subplots, they pursue a serial killer stalking England's winning soccer team, a vigilante gang hanging drug dealers and a hit man known as \"The Alien\" because he whacked a victim engrossed in the video of that movie with a baseball bat just as the monster pops out of John Hurt's chest. But quieter moments, such as Brant's visit to his home county in Ireland, are just as interesting.",

    "description": "In 1975, at the height of Indira Gandhi\u2019s \u201cEmergency,\u201d V. S. Naipaul returned to India, the country his ancestors had left one hundred years earlier. Out of that journey he produced this concise masterpiece: a vibrant, defiantly unsentimental portrait of a society traumatized by centuries of foreign conquest and immured in a mythic vision of its past.<br /><br />Drawing on novels, news reports, political memoirs, and his own encounters with ordinary Indians\u2013from a supercilious prince to an engineer constructing housing for Bombay\u2019s homeless\u2013Naipaul captures a vast, mysterious, and agonized continent inaccessible to foreigners and barely visible to its own people. He sees both the burgeoning space program and the 5,000 volunteers chanting mantras to purify a defiled temple; the feudal village autocrat and the Naxalite revolutionaries who combined Maoist rhetoric with ritual murder. Relentless in its vision, thrilling in the keenness of its prose, <b>India: A Wounded Civilization</b><i> </i>is a work of astonishing insight and candor.",

Combining meticulous research with crisp narratives and plots as current as the headlines, Forsyth shows us the world as it is in a way that few have ever been able to equal.</blockquote>\n</b>And the world as it is today is a very scary place.<p>When British and American intelligence catch wind of a major Al Qaeda operation in the works, they instantly galvanize- but to do what? They know nothing about it: the what, where, or when. They have no sources in Al Qaeda, and it's impossible to plant someone. Impossible, unless . . .</p><p>The Afghan is Izmat Khan, a five-year prisoner of Guant\u00e1namo Bay and a former senior commander of the Taliban. The Afghan is also Colonel Mike Martin, a twenty-five-year veteran of war zones around the world-a dark, lean man born and raised in Iraq. In an attempt to stave off disaster, the intelligence agencies will try to do what no one has ever done before-pass off a Westerner as an Arab among Arabs-pass off Martin as the trusted Khan.</p><p>It will require extraordinary preparation, and then extraordinary luck, for nothing can truly prepare Martin for the dark and shifting world into which he is about to enter. Or for the terrible things he will find there.</p><p>Filled with remarkable detail and compulsive drama, <i>The Afghan</i> is further proof that Forsyth is truly master of suspense.</p>",

For twenty years Claire Randall has kept her secrets. But now she is returning with her grown daughter to Scotland's majestic mist-shrouded hills. Here Claire plans to reveal a truth as stunning as the events that gave it birth: about the mystery of an ancient circle of standing stones... about a love that transcends the boundaries of time... and about James Fraser, a Scottish warrior whose gallantry once drew a young Claire from the security of her century to the danger of his. Now a legacy of blood and desire will test her beautiful copper-haired daughter, Brianna, as Claire's spellbinding journey of self-discovery continues in the intrigue-ridden Paris court of Charles Stuart.(",

Obsessed with 'making things good again', they spin the quiet terrors of family life into a fantastical frenzy that careens well and truly out of control. As A. M. Homes's incendiary novel unfolds, the Kodacolor hues of the American good life become nearly hallucinogenic: from a strange and hilarious encounter on the floor of the pantry with a Stepford-wife neighbour, to a house-cleaning team in space suits, to a hostage situation at the school. Homes lays bare the foundations of marriage and family life, and creates characters outrageously flawed, deeply human and entirely believable.",

    "description": "Nervous, inexperienced, confused. For most, losing your virginity is one of life's most significant moments, always to be remembered. Of course, experiences vary, but Laura Carpenter asks: Is there an ideal way to lose it? What would constitute a \"positive\" experience? What often compels the big step? And, further, what does \"going all the way\" really mean for young gays and lesbians?<br /><br />In this first comprehensive study of virginity loss, Carpenter teases out the complexities of all things virgin by drawing on interviews with both young men and women who are straight, gay or bisexual. <strong>Virginity Lost</strong> offers a rare window into one of life's most intimate and significant sexual moments. The stories here are frank, poignant and fascinating as Carpenter presents an array of experiences that run the gamut from triumphant to devastating.<br /><br /><br /><br />Importantly, Carpenter argues that one's experience of virginity loss can have a powerful impact on one's later sexual experiences. Especially at a time of increased debate about sexual abstinence versus safe sex education in public schools, this important volume will provide essential information about the sex lives of young people.",

He exposes the people and organizations that manipulate our perceptions and profit from our anxieties: politicians who win elections by heightening concerns about crime and drug use even as both are declining; advocacy groups that raise money by exaggerating the prevalence of particular diseases; TV news-magazines that monger a new scare every week to garner ratings.",

    "description": "From the time of its first publication, <i>Tearoom Trade</i> engendered controversy. It was also accorded an unusual amount of praise for a first book on a marginal, intentionally self-effacing population by a previously unknown sociologist. The book was quickly recognized as an important, imaginative, and useful contribution to our understanding of \"deviant\" sexual activity. Describing impersonal, anonymous sexual encounters in public restrooms--\"tearooms\" in the argot--the book explored the behavior of men whose closet homosexuality was kept from their families and neighbors.<br /><br />By posing as an initiate, the author was able to engage in systematic observation of homosexual acts in public settings, and later to develop a more complete picture of those involved by interviewing them in their homes, again without revealing their unwitting participation in his study.<br /><br />This enlarged edition of <i>Tearoom Trade</i> includes the original text, together with a retrospect, written by Nicholas von Hoffman, Irving Louis Horowitz, Lee Rainwater, Donald P. Warwick, and Myron Glazer. The material added includes a perspective on the social scientist at work and the ethical problems to which that work may give rise, along with debate by the book's initial critics and proponents. Humphreys added a postscript and his views on the opinion expressed in the retrospect.",

    "description": "<b>Share the shame.</b> <br /><br /> In the days before blogs, teenagers recorded their lives with a pen in top-secret notebooks, usually emblazoned with an earnest, underlined plea to parents to keep away. Since 2002, David Nadelberg has tapped that vast wellspring of adolescent anguish in the stage show <i>Mortified</i>, in which grown men and women confront their past with firsthand tales of their first kiss, first puff, worst prom, fights with mom, life at bible camp, worst hand job, best mall job, and reasons they deserved to marry Simon LeBon. <br /><br /> Following the same formula that has made the live show a beloved cult hit, <i>Mortified</i> the book takes real childhood journals and documents and edits the entries into captivating, comedic, and cathartic stories, introduced by their now older (and allegedly wiser) authors. From letters begging rescue from a hellish summer camp to catty locker notes about stuck-up classmates to obsessive love that borders on stalking, <i>Mortified</i> gives voice to the real -- and really pathetic -- hopes, fears, desires, and creative urgings that have united adolescents for generations.",

    "description": "<p>The winner of Britain's prestigious Whitbread Prize and a bestseller there for months, this wonderfully readable biography offers a rich, rollicking picture of late-eighteenth-century British aristocracy and the intimate story of a woman who for a time was its undisputed leader.<br /><br />Lady Georgiana Spencer was the great-great-great-great-aunt of Diana, Princess of Wales, and was nearly as famous in her day. In 1774, at the age of seventeen, Georgiana achieved immediate celebrity by marrying one of England's richest and most influential aristocrats, the Duke of Devonshire. Launched into a world of wealth and power, she quickly became the queen of fashionable society, adored by the Prince of Wales, a dear friend of Marie-Antoinette, and leader of the most important salon of her time. Not content with the role of society hostess, she used her connections to enter politics, eventually becoming more influential than most of the men who held office. <br /><br />Her good works and social exploits made her loved by the multitudes, but Georgiana's public success, like Diana's, concealed a personal life that was fraught with suffering. The Duke of Devonshire was unimpressed by his wife's legendary charms, preferring instead those of her closest friend, a woman with whom Georgiana herself was rumored to be on intimate terms. For over twenty years, the three lived together in a jealous and uneasy m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois, during which time both women bore the Duke's children\u2014as well as those of other men.<br /><br />Foreman's descriptions of Georgiana's uncontrollable gambling, all-night drinking, drug taking, and love affairs with the leading politicians of the day give us fascinating insight into the lives of the British aristocracy in the era of the madness of King George III, the American and French revolutions, and the defeat of Napoleon. <br /><br />A gifted young historian whom critics are already likening to Antonia Fraser, Amanda Foreman draws on a wealth of fresh research and writes colorfully and penetratingly about the fascinating Georgiana, whose struggle against her own weaknesses, whose great beauty and flamboyance, and whose determination to play a part in the affairs of the world make her a vibrant, astonishingly contemporary figure.</p>",

But will he be able to prove his case before disaster strikes? And how will it all affect Prince Charming's upstart campaign to become the new mayor of Fabletown?<br /><br /><b>Collecting</b>: <i>Fables</i> 19-21, 23-27, The Last Castle",

For the Mayor of Fabletown, it means a rude awakening to the harsh realities of civis administration - and its conflicting demands. And for Snow herself, it means a long, painful labor - and a series of joyous, heartwrenching surprises. <br /><br /><b>Collecting</b>: <i>Fables</i> 22, 28-33",

The \"tobacco brides\" would be on board--eligible women seeking a better life in America, bartered for with barrels of tobacco from the fields.<br /><br />Drew O'Connor isn't stirred by news of a ship full of brides. Still broken-hearted from the loss of his beloved, he only wants a maid to tend his house and care for his young sister.<br /><br />What he ends up with is a wife\u2014a feisty redhead who claims she is <i>Lady</i> Constance Morrow, daughter of an Earl, brought to America against her will. And she wants to go straight back to England as soon as she can. She hasn't the foggiest notion how to cook, dares to argue with her poor husband, and spends more time working on mathematical equations than housework. What kind of a wife is <i>that</i>? Drew's Christian forbearance is in for some testing.<br /><br />Headstrong and intelligent, deeply moral but incredibly enticing, Constance turns what was supposed to be a marriage of convenience into something most inconvenient, indeed.",

    "description": "Why was the UN a bystander during the Rwandan genocide? Do its sins of omission leave it morally responsible for the hundreds of thousands of dead? Michael Barnett, who worked at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations from 1993 to 1994, covered Rwanda for much of the genocide. Based on his first-hand experiences, archival work, and interviews with many key participants, he reconstructs the history of the UN's involvement in Rwanda. In the weeks leading up to the genocide, the author documents, the UN was increasingly aware or had good reason to suspect that Rwanda was a site of crimes against humanity. Yet it failed to act. In <i>Eyewitness to a Genocide</i>, Barnett argues that its indifference was driven not by incompetence or cynicism but rather by reasoned choices cradled by moral considerations.<br /><br />Employing a novel approach to ethics in practice and in relationship to international organizations, Barnett offers an unsettling possibility: the UN culture recast the ethical commitments of well-intentioned individuals, arresting any duty to aid at the outset of the genocide. Barnett argues that the UN bears some moral responsibility for the genocide. Particularly disturbing is his observation that not only did the UN violate its moral responsibilities, but also that many in New York believed that they were \"doing the right thing\" as they did so. Barnett addresses the ways in which the Rwandan genocide raises a warning about this age of humanitarianism and concludes by asking whether it is possible to build moral institutions.",

    "description": "This eagerly anticipated new novel is Eden Robinson\u2019s most satisfying, disturbing, and addictive to date.<br /><br />A new novel from one of our best young writers, <i>Blood Sports</i> is the tough, gritty story of the brutal cat-and-mouse relationship between two cousins \u2014 Tom and Jeremy Bauer \u2014 set in Vancouver\u2019s Downtown East Side.<br /><br />Tom, a young man, hardly innocent, has been caught up over the years in Jeremy\u2019s world of drugs, extortion, and prostitutes, while Jeremy, vindictive, vicious, either protects Tom or uses him, but always controls him. Added to the mix is Paulie, a junkie two years clean and Tom\u2019s girlfriend, and also the mother of his daughter. This lethal triangle shifts when word gets out Tom has been talking to the police, and men from the past who have a lot to lose reappear. Suddenly Tom and Paulie are pawns in a much larger game, with everything at stake.<br /><br />With the storytelling skill and engrossing characterizations that have made her previous books so popular, Robinson keeps the tension humming in this riveting novel. This is Eden Robinson at the height of her powers.<br /><br />\u201cI was born on the same day as Edgar Allan Poe and Dolly Parton. I am absolutely certain that this affects my writing in some way.\u201d<br />\u2014Eden Robinson<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "It is hard to believe that there was once a time when zero didn't exist, but zero was a relatively recent invention; born as an Eastern philosophical concept its history is one of struggle and intrigue. This informative and easy-to-read book is the story of the people who battled over the meaning of the mysterious number - the scholars and mystics, the scientists and clergymen - who each tried to understand zero. It involves Archimedes, Aristotle, Newton and Stephen Hawking, and is a history of the paradoxes posed by this innocent-looking number, rattling even this century's biggest minds and threatening the unravel the whole framework of scientific thought. The story of zero involved not only mathematics but history. The clashes over zero were the battles that shook the foundations of philosophy, of science, of mathematics, and of religion. Underneath every revolution in the last millennium lay a zero.",

In her retelling of the story of a god tricked into holding the world on his shoulders and his brief reprieve, she sets difficult questions about the nature of choice and coercion, how we choose our own destiny and at the same time can liberate ourselves from our seeming fate. Finally in paperback, <i>Weight</i> is a daring, seductive addition to Canongate\u2019s ambitious series of myths by the world\u2019s most acclaimed authors.",

No longer must you suffer silently as some clerk in a \u201cTod Browning\u2019s <i>Freaks</i>\u201d T-shirt bombards you with baffling allusions to \u201cwire-fu\u201d pictures, \u201cTodd-AO process,\u201d and \u201cSam Raimi.\u201d By helping to close the knowledge gap between average moviegoers and incorrigible Snobs, the dictionary lets you in on hidden gems that film geeks have been hoarding (such as Douglas Sirk and Guy Maddin movies) while exposing the trash that Snobs inexplicably laud (e.g., most chop-socky films and Mexican wrestling pictures). Delightfully illustrated and handily organized in alphabetical order for quick reference, <i>The Film Snob*s Dictionary</i> is your fail-safe companion in the video store, the cineplex, or wherever insufferable Film Snobs congregate.",

    "description": "Gore Vidal, one of the master stylists of American literature and one of the most acute observers of American life and history, turns his immense literary and historiographic talent to a portrait of the formidable trio of George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson.<p>In Inventing a Nation, Vidal transports the reader into the minds, the living rooms (and bedrooms), the convention halls, and the salons of Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and other key figures who helped found the American Republic. Vidal's splendid and percipient prose animates key moments of decision in the birthing of our nation, and we come to know these men in ways we have not until now - their opinions of each other, their worries about money, their concerns about creating a viable democracy. Vidal brings them to life and illuminates the force and weight of the documents they wrote, the speeches they gave, and the institutions of government they fashioned. Above all, Inventing a Nation presents a powerful, compassionate, immensely moving portrait of George Washington, whose resolution, integrity, and intelligence rescued the fledgling Republic many times in its early days.</p>",

Things are unstable enough in Russia without high-level assassination, but even more disturbing may be the identities of the potential assassins. Were they political enemies, the Russian Mafia, or disaffected former KGB? Or, Ryan wonders, is something far more dangerous at work here?</p><p>Ryan is right. For even while he dispatches his most trusted eyes and ears, including black ops specialist John Clark, to find out the truth of the matter, forces in China are moving ahead with a plan of truly audacious proportions. If they succeed, the world as we know it will never look the same. If they fail...the consequences will be unspeakable.</p><p>Blending the exceptional realism and authenticity that are his hallmarks with intricate plotting, razor-sharp suspense, and a remarkable cast of characters, this is Clancy at his best--and there is none better.</p>",

Twice every three days another citizen is shot, stabbed, or bludgeoned to death. At the center of this hurricane of crime is the city's homicide unit, a small brotherhood of hard men who fight for whatever justice is possible in a deadly world.<br /><br />David Simon was the first reporter ever to gain unlimited access to a homicide unit, and this electrifying book tells the true story of a year on the violent streets of an American city. The narrative follows Donald Worden, a veteran investigator; Harry Edgerton, a black detective in a mostly white unit; and Tom Pellegrini, an earnest rookie who takes on the year's most difficult case, the brutal rape and murder of an eleven-year-old girl.<br /><br />Originally published fifteen years ago, <i>Homicide</i> became the basis for the acclaimed television show of the same name. This new edition--which includes a new introduction, an afterword, and photographs--revives this classic, riveting tale about the men who work on the dark side of the American experience.",

    "description": "<b>The New York Times bestselling investigation into white-collar unemployment from \"our premier reporter of the underside of capitalism\"--The New York Times Book Review</b><br /><br />Americans' working lives are growing more precarious every day. Corporations slash employees by the thousands, and the benefits and pensions once guaranteed by \"middle-class\" jobs are a thing of the past.<br /><br />In <i>Bait and Switch</i>, Barbara Ehrenreich goes back undercover to explore another hidden realm of the economy: the shadowy world of the white-collar unemployed. Armed with the plausible resume of a professional \"in transition,\" she attempts to land a \"middle-class\" job. She submits to career coaching, personality testing, and EST-like boot camps, and attends job fairs, networking events, and evangelical job-search ministries. She is proselytized, scammed, lectured, and--again and again--rejected.<br /><br /><i>Bait and Switch</i> highlights the people who have done everything right--gotten college degrees, developed marketable skills, and built up impressive resumes--yet have become repeatedly vulnerable to financial disaster. There are few social supports for these newly disposable workers, Ehrenreich discovers, and little security even for those who have jobs. Worst of all, there is no honest reckoning with the inevitable consequences of the harsh new economy; rather, the jobless are persuaded that they have only themselves to blame.<br /><br />Alternately hilarious and tragic, <i>Bait and Switch</i>, like the classic <i>Nickel and Dimed</i>, is a searing expose of the cruel new reality in which we all now live.",

    "description": "In 1789 the West Indian colony of San Domingo supplied two-thirds of the overseas trade of France. The entire structure of what was arguably the most profitable colony in the world rested on the labour of half a million slaves. In 1791 the waves of unrest inspired by the French Revolution reached across the Atlantic dividing the loyalties of the white population of the island. The brutally treated slaves of Saint Domingo seized at this confusion and rose up in rebellion against masters. In thisclassic work, CLR James chronicles the only successful slave revolt in history and provides a critical portrait of their leader, Toussaint L'Ouverture, 'one of the most remarkable men of a period rich in remarkable men'.",

    "description": "The inspiring story of one young activist's visionary effort to revitalize the United States' neediest schools. As a 21-year-old college senior, Wendy Kopp decided to transform the education system in America. From her dorm room at Princeton University, she set about creating Teach For America, a programme that sends outstanding college graduates to teach for two years in the most dilapidated and under-resourced urban and rural public schools in the United States. Since the first group of teachers entered classrooms in 1990, over 5000 TFA corps members have been placed in teaching positions all over the country. With their astonishing classroom success, these young teachers have proven that it is possible for children in low-income areas to reach the same level of academic achievement as children in more privileged areas. One Day, All Children tells the remarkable story of one young woman's tenacious grasp on a seemingly impossible dream.",

    "description": "With \"Music Through the Floor,\" Pushcart Prize winner and former Wallace Stegner Fellow Eric Puchner makes an extraordinary debut: a collection of nine unforgettable stories -- strikingly original, fiercely funny, and quietly heartbreaking -- portraying a group of cultural misfits attempting to navigate mainstream America. Lost, teetering on the edge of normalcy, Puchner's characters seek to define themselves in a frequently absurd and hostile world -- a world that threatens to make outcasts of us all. Caught up in loneliness or solitude, they can't quite hear the music of their own lives.<br /><br />In \"Children of God,\" a young loner becomes the caretaker and companion for two mentally retarded men, seeking solace in their outsider status. \"Essay #3: Leda and the Swan\" is told in the forlorn, be-nighted, and tragically funny voice of a high school girl who longs more than anything to be loved. In \"Mission,\" an idealistic ESL teacher is faced with the inscrutable wrath of one of his immigrant students. And in the unsettling \"Child's Play,\" Puchner explores the price of nonconformity by following a pack of boys wreaking havoc on Halloween.<br /><br />Writing from an impressive range of perspectives -- men and women, children and adults, immigrants and tourists -- Puchner deftly exposes the dark, ten-der undersides of his characters with arresting beauty and precision. Here are people fumbling for identity in a depersonalized world, captured in moments that are hilarious, shocking, and transcendent -- sometimes all at once. Unfailingly true, surprisingly moving, and impossible to forget, these nine stories mark the arrival of a brilliant young writer and one of our most promising literary voices.",

After decades of slacking off at low-paying dead-end jobs, blowing his cash on booze and women, and scrimping by in flea-bitten apartments, Chinaski sees his poetic star rising at last. Now, at fifty, he is reveling in his sudden rock-star life, running three hundred hangovers a year, and maintaining a sex life that would cripple Casanova.<br /><br />With all of Bukowski's trademark humor and gritty, dark honesty, this 1978 follow-up to <em>Post Office</em> and <em>Factotum</em> is an uncompromising account of life on the edge.",

Cartledge brilliantly evokes Alexander's remarkable political and military accomplishments, cutting through the myths to show why he was such a great leader. He explores our endless fascination with Alexander and gives us insight into his charismatic leadership, his capacity for brutality, and his sophisticated grasp of international politics.<b> Alexander the Great</b> is an engaging portrait of a fascinating man, and a welcome balance to the myths, legends, and often skewed history that have obscured the real Alexander.",

    "description": "During the 1980s, Michael Milken at Drexel Burnham Lambert was the Billionaire Junk Bond King. He invented such things as \"the highly confident letter\" (I'm highly confident that I can raise the money you need to buy company X) and \"the blind pool\" (Here's a billion dollars: let us help you buy a company), and he financed the biggest corporate raiders--men like Carl Icahn and Ronald Perelman.<br /><br />And then, on September 7, 1988, things changed. The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert with insider trading and stock fraud. Waiting in the wings was the US District Attorney, who wanted to file criminal and racketeering charges. What motivated Milken in his drive for power and money? Did Drexel Burnham Lambert condone the breaking of laws? <i>The Predators' Ball </i>dramatically captures American business history in the making, uncovering the philosophy of greed that has dominated Wall Street in the 1980s.",

    "description": "The most mysterious and elusive of all sea creatures, the giant squid -at least sixty feet long and weighing more than a ton- is also one of the largest. With two whip-like tentacles, eight arms studded with toothed suckers, and two lidless eyes the size of dinner plates, <i>Architeurthis</i> has inspired myths and movies, nightmares and religious conversions. Yet it has never been studies while alive.<br /><br />Marin biologist, explorer, and artist Richard Ellis delves into myth, literature, and science to bring readers face-to-face with this remarkable creature as it terrifies sailors ad fishermen throughout history and battles for its life against the great sperm whale. Ellis continues his exploration into the modern era, when scientists rush to study a rare carcass, and the giant squid is a staple on the big screen.<br /><br /><p>Interweaving his narrative with a wralth of illustrations and photographs, Ellis gives us the first scientific and cultural history of the only living creature that can still truly be called a sea monster.</p>",

    "description": "The heroine of <i>Sarah Waters's</i> audacious first novel knows her destiny, and seems content with it. Her place is in her father's seaside restaurant, shucking shellfish and stirring soup, singing all the while. \"Although I didn't long believe the story told to me by Mother - that they had found me as a baby in an oyster-shell, and a greedy customer had almost eaten me for lunch - for eighteen years I never doubted my own oysterish sympathies, never looked far beyond my father's kitchen for occupation, or for love.\" At night Nancy Astley often ventures to the nearby music hall, not that she has illusions of being more than an audience member. But the moment she spies a new male impersonator - still something of a curiosity in England circa 1888 - her years of innocence come to an end and a life of transformations begins. <br /><br /><i>Tipping the Velvet</i>, all 472 pages of it, is as saucy, as tantalizing, and as touching as the narrator's first encounter with the seductive but shame-ridden Miss Kitty Butler. And at first even Nancy's family is thrilled with her gender-bending pal, all but her sister, best friend, and bedmate, Alice, \"her eyes shining cold and dull, with starlight and suspicion.\" Not to worry. Soon Nancy and Kitty are off to London, their relationship close though (alas for our heroine) sisterly. We know that bliss will come, and it does, in an exceptionally charged moment. A lesser author would have been content to stop her story there, but Waters has much more in mind for her buttonholing heroine, and for us. In brief, her Everywoman with a sexual difference goes from success onstage to heartbreak to a stint as a male prostitute (necessity truly is the mother of invention) to keeping house for a brother and sister in the Labour movement. And did I mention her long stint as a plaything in the pleasure palace of a rich Sapphist extraordinaire? Diana Lethaby is as cruel as she is carnal, and even the well-concealed Cavendish Ladies' Club isn't <i>outr\u00e9</i> enough for her. Kitting Nancy out in full, elegant drag, she dares the front desk to turn them away. \"We are here,\" she mocks, \"for the sake of the irregular.\" <br />Only after some seven years of hard twists and sensual turns does Nancy conclude that a life of sensation is not enough. Still, <i>Tipping the Velvet</i> is so entertaining that readers will wish her sentimental - and hedonistic - education had taken twice as long. <i>--Kerry Fried</i>",

At the edges of the world stand walls of ice which push slowly forward to reclaim the land for the night. And at the world's center, in the Holy Land where two great religions were born, are the Wells of Ihrain, the source of the greatest magics. Over the last century the Patriarchs of the West have demanded crusades to claim the Wells from the Pramans, the followers of the Written. Now an uneasy truce extends between the Pramans and the West, waiting for a spark to start the conflict anew.\u00a0Then, on a mission in the Holy Land, the young Praman warrior Else is attacked by a creature of the Dark-in effect, a minor god. Too ignorant to know that he can never prevail over such a thing, he fights it and wins, and in so doing, sets the terrors of the night against him.\u00a0As a reward for his success, Else is sent as a spy to the heart of the Patriarchy to direct their attention away from further ventures into the Holy Lands. Dogged by hidden enemies and faithless allies, Else witnesses senseless butchery and surprising acts of faith as he penetrates to the very heart of the Patriarchy and rides alongside their armies in a new crusade against his own people. But the Night rides with him, too, sending two of its once-human agents from the far north to assassinate him.\u00a0Submerged in his role, he begins to doubt his faith, his country, even his family. As his mission careens out of control, he faces unanswerable questions about his future. It is said that God will know his own, but can one who has slain gods ever know forgiveness?\u00a0In <i>The Tyranny of the Night</i>, Glen Cook introduces a new fantasy epic for the ages.",

    "description": "The terrorist attacks of September 11 have turned the world\u2019s attention to areas of the globe about which we know very little. Ahmed Rashid, who masterfully explained Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban regime in his previous book, here turns his skills as an investigative journalist to the five Central Asian republics adjacent to Afghanistan. Central Asia is coming to play a vital strategic role in the war on terrorism, but the region also poses new threats to global security.<br /><br />The five Central Asian republics\u2014Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan\u2014were part of the Soviet Union until its collapse in 1991. Under Soviet rule, Islam was brutally suppressed, and that intolerance has continued under the post-Soviet regimes. Religious repression, political corruption, and the region\u2019s extreme poverty (unemployment rates exceed 80 percent in some areas) have created a fertile climate for militant Islamic fundamentalism. Often funded and trained by such organizations as Osama bin Laden\u2019s Al Qaeda and the Taliban, guerrilla movements like the IMU (Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan) have recruited a staggering number of members across the region and threaten to topple the governments of all five nations. Based on groundbreaking research and numerous interviews, <i>Jihad </i>explains<i> </i>the roots of militant rage in Central Asia, describes the goals and activities of these militant organizations, and suggests ways in which this threat could be neutralized by diplomatic and economic intervention.<br /><br />Rich in both cultural heritage and natural resources\u2014including massive oil reservoirs\u2014Central Asia remains desperately poor and frighteningly volatile. In tracing the history of Central Asia and explaining the current political climate, Rashid demonstrates that it is a region we ignore at our peril.",

    "description": "This is a collection of stories diverse in subject, but sutured together by the limitless affection the author holds for the land and the people of New England. Donald Hall tells about life on a small farm where, as a boy, he spent summers with his grandparents. Gradually the boy grows to be a young man, sees his grandparents aging, the farm become marginal, and finally, the cows sold and the barn abandoned. <br /><br />But these are more than nostalgic memories, for in the measured and tender prose of each episode are signs of the end of things - a childhood, perhaps a culture.",

His work is leading General Technics to the forefront of global domination, both in the marketplace and politically\u2014it's about to take over a country in Africa. Donald Hogan is his roommate, a seemingly sheepish bookworm. But Hogan is a spy, and he's about to discover a breakthrough in genetic engineering that will change the world ... and kill him. These two men's lives weave through one of science fiction's most praised novels. Written in a way that echoes John Dos Passos' <i>U.S.A. Trilogy</i>, <i>Stand on Zanzibar</i> is a cross-section of a world overpopulated by the billions. Where society is squeezed into hive-living madness by god-like mega computers, mass-marketed psychedelic drugs, and mundane uses of genetic engineering. Though written in 1968, it speaks of 2010, and is frighteningly prescient and intensely powerful.<br /><br />This edition comes with a tipped in collectors' note and an introduction by David Brin.",

    "description": "Candide is the most famous of Voltaire's \"philosophical tales,\" in which he combined witty improbabilities with the sanest of good sense. First published in 1759, it was an instant bestseller and has come to be regarded as one of the key texts of the Enlightenment. What Candide does for chivalric romance, the other tales in this selection--Micromegas, Zadig, The Ingenu, and The White Bull--do for science fiction, the Oriental tale, the sentimental novel, and the Old Testament. The most extensive one-volume selection currently available, this new edition includes a new verse translation of the story Voltaire based on Chaucer's The Wife of Bath's Tale: What Pleases the Ladies and opens with a revised introduction that reflects recent critical debates, including a new section on Candide.",

    "description": "Few women do it and even fewer will admit to it. But in Toni Bentley's daring and intimate memoir, <em>The Surrender</em>, she pulls the sheets back on an erotic experience that's been forbidden since the Bible and celebrates \"the joy that lies on the other side of convention, where risk is real and rapture resides.\" From <em>Story of O</em> to <em>The Kiss</em> to <em>The Sexual Life of Catherine M</em>., readers have been enthralled with sexually subversive memoirs by women. But even those erotic classics didn't navigate the psychosexual terrain that Bentley does when she meets a lover who introduces her to a radical and unexpected pleasure, to the \"holy\" act that she came to see as her awakening.<br /><br /><em>The Surrender</em> is a witty, intelligent, and eloquent exploration of one woman's obsession that will be sure to leave readers questioning their own desires.",

    "description": "Sixty-five million years ago, a disastrous cataclysm eliminated three quarters of all life on Earth. Overnight, the ago of dinosaurs ended. The age of dinosaurs ended. The age of mammals had begun.<br /><br />But what if history had happened differently? What if the reptiles had survived to evolve intelligent life?<br /><br />In <i>West of Eden</i>, bestselling author Harry Harrison has created a rich, dramatic saga of a world where the descendents of the dinosaurs struggled with a clan of humans in a battle for survival.<br /><br />Here is the story of Kerrick, a young hunter who grows to manhood among the dinosaurs, escaping at last to rejoin his own kind. His knowledge of their strange customs makes him the humans' leader...and the dinosaurs' greatest enemy.<br /><br />Rivalling Frank Herbert's <i>Dune</i> in the majesty of its scope and conception, <i>West of Eden</i> is a monumental epic of love and savagery, bravery and hope.",

This remarkable book describes Fout's odyssey from novice researcher to celebrity scientist to impassioned crusader for the rights of animals. Living and conversing with these sensitive creatures has given him a profound appreciation of what they can teach us about ourselves. It has also made Fouts an outspoken opponent of biomedical experimentation on chimpanzees. A voyage of scientific discovery and interspecies communication, this is a stirring tale of friendship, courage, and compassion that will change forever the way we view our biological--and spritual--next of kin.<br /><br />Fouts is a professor of Psychology.",

    "description": "In his journal, John Steinbeck called <i>East of Eden</i> \"the first book,\" and indeed it has the primordial power and simplicity of myth. Set in the rich farmland of California's Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families--the Trasks and the Hamiltons--whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.<br /><br />Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new, rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives, nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness, enveloped by a mysterious darkness.<br /><br />First published in 1952, <i>East of Eden</i> is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years, <i>East of Eden</i> is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.",

    "description": "In a remote Manchurian town in the 1930s, a sixteen-year-old girl is more concerned with intimations of her own womanhood than the escalating hostilities between her countrymen and their Japanese occupiers. While still a schoolgirl in braids, she takes her first lover, a dissident student. The more she understands of adult life, however, the more disdainful she is of its deceptions, and the more she loses herself in her one true passion: the ancient game of go.<br /><br />Incredibly for a teenager\u2013and a girl at that\u2013she dominates the games in her town. No opponent interests her until she is challenged by a stranger, who reveals himself to us as a Japanese soldier in disguise. They begin a game and continue it for days, rarely speaking but deeply moved by each other\u2019s strategies. As the clash of their peoples becomes ever more desperate and inescapable, and as each one\u2019s untold life begins to veer wildly off course, the girl and the soldier are absorbed by only one thing\u2013the progress of their game, each move of which brings them closer to their shocking fate.<br /><br />In <b>The Girl Who Played Go</b><i>, </i>Shan Sa has distilled the piercing emotions of adolescence into an engrossing, austerely beautiful story of love, cruelty and loss of innocence.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

Sula Peace has rejected the life Nel has embraced, escaping to college, and submerging herself in city life. When she returns to her roots, it is as a rebel and a wanton seductress. Eventually, both women must face the consequences of their choices. Together, they create an unforgettable portrait of what it means and costs to be a black woman in America.",

    "description": "<i>Being &amp; Nothingness</i> is without doubt one of the most significant philosophical books of the 20th century. The central work by one of the century's most influential thinkers, it altered the course of western philosophy. Its revolutionary approach challenged all previous assumptions about the individual's relationship with the world. Known as 'the Bible of existentialism', its impact on culture &amp; literature was immediate &amp; was felt worldwide, from the absurdist drama of Samuel Beckett to the soul-searching cries of the Beat poets.<br /><i>Being &amp; Nothingness</i> is one of those rare books whose influence has affected the mindset of subsequent generations. Seventy years after its 1st publication, its message remains as potent as ever--challenging readers to confront the fundamental dilemmas of human freedom, choice, responsibility &amp; action.",

    "description": "Before the movie, this is the novel that gave life to Hawkeye Pierce, Trapper John, Hot Lips Houlihan, Frank Burns, Radar O'Reilly, and the rest of the gang that made the 4077th MASH like no other place in Korea or on earth. The doctors who worked in the Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals (MASH) during the Korean War were well trained but, like most soldiers sent to fight a war, too young for the job. In the words of the author, \"a few flipped their lids, but most of them just raised hell, in a variety of ways and degrees.\"<br /><br />For fans of the movie and the series alike, here is the original version of that perfectly corrupt football game, those martini-laced mornings and sexual escapades, and that unforgettable foray into assisted if incompleted suicide--all as funny and poignant now as they were before they became a part of America's culture and heart.",

    "description": "Frances Mayes - widely published poet, gourmet cook, and travel writer - opens the door on a wondrous new world when she buys and restores an abandoned villa in the spectacular Tuscan countryside. She finds faded frescoes beneath the whitewash in the dining room, a vineyard under wildly overgrown brambles - and even a wayward scorpion under her pillow. And from her traditional kitchen and simple garden she creates dozens of delicious seasonal recipes, all included in this book.<br />In the vibrant local markets and neighbouring hill towns, the author explores the nuances of the Italian landscape, history and cuisine. Each adventure yields delightful surprises - the perfect <i>panettone</i>, an unforgettable wine, or painted Etruscan tombs. Doing for Tuscany what Peter Mayle did for Provence, Mayes writes about the tastes and pleasures of a foreign country with gusto and passion. A celebration of the extraordinary quality of life in Tuscany, <i>Under the Tuscan Sun</i> is a feast for all the senses.",

Initially, titles were published by Grosset & Dunlap, but with #57 (1979) publication switched to Simon & Schuster. Some people consider these first 56 to be the original series and consider the Simon & Schuster series to be an entirely different series. The first 56 are considered to be the \"classic\" Nancy Drew books. In 2003, the series was discontinued, and a new, more contemporary series <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/40765-nancy-drew-girl-detective\">(Nancy Drew Girl Detective)</a> was created in its place.\n    \n    The series may be published in different orders in translation; see:\n    * <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/84730-siri-salma\">Siri Salma</a>",

Here is an enemy Keely cannot conquer. With all the will in the world, she cannot pass on to Patrick her zest or her energy or her own good health. Keely\u2019s battle to save Patrick has become one of the classics of Canadian children\u2019s literature and, in translations, around the world.

    "description": "A beautifully illustrated guidebook to drawing human anatomy, from the professor who teaches the subject at the University of Oxford's Ruskin School of Art. Using superb, specially commissioned photographs of male and female models, together with historical and contemporary works of art and her own illustrations, Sarah Simblet shows us how to see inside the human frame, to map its muscle groups and skeletal structure, to capture its balance, poise, and grace.<br /><br />Many of the photographs are overlaid with transparent pages showing the skeletal and muscular systems, so that students can understand how the body's outer appearance relates to its internal anatomy. Lessons focus on different anatomical areas in detail, as well as techniques for seeing and portraying the human body as a whole. In ten \"masterclass\" sections, Simblet breaks down great works of art, from Hans Holbein's <i>The Body of the Dead Christ </i>to Edward Hopper's <i>Hotel Room</i>, using photographs of models in the same pose to invite readers to see the human body as the masters did.<br /><br /><i>Anatomy for the Artist</i> equips artists of all levels with the skills they need to understand and interpret the human body, and to imaginatively represent it in their own work.",

    "description": "Following in the wake of his groundbreaking War in the Age of Intelligent Machines, Manuel De Landa presents a radical synthesis of historical development over the last one thousand years. More than a simple expository history, A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History sketches the outlines of a renewed materialist philosophy of history in the tradition of Fernand Braudel, Gilles Deleuze, and Felix Guattari, while also engaging the critical new understanding of material processes derived from the sciences of dynamics. Working against prevailing attitudes that see history as an arena of texts, discourses, ideologies, and metaphors, De Landa traces the concrete movements and interplays of matter and energy through human populations in the last millennium. De Landa attacks three domains that have given shape to human societies: economics, biology, and linguistics. In every case, what one sees is the self-directed processes of matter and energy interacting with the whim and will of human history itself to form a panoramic vision of the West free of rigid teleology and naive notions of progress, and even more important, free of any deterministic source of its urban, institutional, and technological forms. Rather, the source of all concrete forms in the West's history are shown to derive from internal morphogenetic capabilities that lie within the flow of matter-energy itself.",

    "description": "From the books of H.G. Wells to the press releases of NASA, we are awash in cliched claims about high technology's ability to change the course of history. Now, in <em>The Shock of the Old</em>, David Edgerton offers a startling new and fresh way of thinking about the history of technology, radically revising our ideas about the interaction of technology and society in the past and in the present. He challenges us to view the history of technology in terms of what everyday people have actually used-and continue to use-rather than just sophisticated inventions. Indeed, many highly touted technologies, from the V-2 rocket to the Concorde jet, have been costly failures, while many mundane discoveries, like corrugated iron, become hugely important around the world. Edgerton reassesses the significance of such acclaimed inventions as the Pill and information technology, and underscores the continued importance of unheralded technology, debunking many notions about the implications of the \"information age.\" A provocative history, <em>The Shock of the Old</em> provides an entirely new way of looking historically at the relationship between invention and innovation.<br />",

Here Fitzroy Maclean recounts his extraordinary adventures in Soviet Central Asia, in the Western Desert, where he specialized in hair-raising commando-style raids behind enemy lines, and with Tito's partisans during the last months of the German occupation of Yugoslavia. An enthralling narrative, brilliantly told, \"Eastern Approaches\" is also a vivid personal view of episodes that have already become part of history.",

    "description": "The appearance, more than sixty years after the Spanish Civil War ended, of mass graves containing victims of Francisco Franco\u2019s death squads finally broke what Spaniards call \u201cthe pact of forgetting\u201d\u2014the unwritten understanding that their recent, painful past was best left unexplored. At this charged moment, Giles Tremlett embarked on a journey around the country and through its history to discover why some of Europe\u2019s most voluble people have kept silent so long. <br /><i>\u00a0</i><br /><i>Ghosts of Spain</i> is the fascinating result of that journey. In elegant and passionate prose, Tremlett unveils the tinderbox of disagreements that mark the country today. Delving\u00a0 into such emotional questions as who caused the Civil War, why Basque terrorists kill, why Catalans hate Madrid, and whether the Islamist bombers who killed 190 people in 2004 dreamed of a return to Spain\u2019s Moorish past, Tremlett finds the ghosts of the past everywhere. At the same time, he offers trenchant observations on more quotidian aspects of Spanish life today: the reasons, for example, Spaniards dislike authority figures, but are cowed by a doctor\u2019s white coat, and how women have embraced feminism without men noticing. <br />\u00a0<br />Drawing on the author\u2019s twenty years of experience living in Spain, <i>Ghosts of Spain</i> is a revelatory book about one of Europe\u2019s most exciting countries.",

Although Maria was once a student radical and still proudly lives by her beliefs, gentle, book-loving Pearl has never been interested in politics\u2013nor in the Catholicism her mother rejected years before. What, then, is driving her to martyr herself? <br /><br />Shaken by this mystery, Maria and her childhood friend (and Pearl\u2019s surrogate father), Joseph Kasperman, both rush to Pearl\u2019s side. As Mary Gordon tells the story of the bonds among them, she<i> </i>takes us deep into the labyrinths of maternal love, religious faith, and Ireland\u2019s tragic history. <i>Pearl</i> is a grand and emotionally daring novel of ideas, told with the tension of a thriller.",

    "description": "<br /><div>\n  <div>\n    <div>\n      <div>Today, millions of people are being held in slavery around the world. From poverty-stricken countries to affluent American suburbs, slaves toil as sweatshop workers, sex slaves, migrant workers, and domestic servants. With expos\u00e9s by seven former slaves--as well as one slaveholder--from Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and the United States, this groundbreaking collection of harrowing first-hand accounts reveals how slavery continues to thrive in the twenty-first century. From the memoirs of Micheline, a Haitian girl coerced into domestic work in Connecticut, to the confessions of Abdel Nasser, a Mauritanian master turned abolitionist, these stories heighten awareness of a global human rights crisis that can no longer be ignored.</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div><br />",

    "description": "The international literary sensation-a runaway bestseller in Spain, rights sold in more than 20 countries-about a boy's quest through the secrets and shadows of postwar Barcelona for a mysterious author whose book has proved as dangerous to own as it is impossible to forget. <br /><br /> Barcelona, 1945-just after the war, a great world city lies in shadow, nursing its wounds, and a boy named Daniel awakes on his eleventh birthday to find that he can no longer remember his mother's face. To console his only child, Daniel's widowed father, an antiquarian book dealer, initiates him into the secret of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a library tended by Barcelona's guild of rare-book dealers as a repository for books forgotten by the world, waiting for someone who will care about them again. Daniel's father coaxes him to choose a volume from the spiraling labyrinth of shelves, one that, it is said, will have a special meaning for him. And Daniel so loves the novel he selects, <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i> by one Julian Carax, that he sets out to find the rest of Carax's work. To his shock, he discovers that someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book this author has written. In fact, he may have the last one in existence. Before Daniel knows it his seemingly innocent quest has opened a door into one of Barcelona's darkest secrets, an epic story of murder, magic, madness and doomed love. And before long he realizes that if he doesn't find out the truth about Julian Carax, he and those closest to him will suffer horribly.",

    "description": "<em>The Museum of Unconditional Surrender\u2014</em>by the renowned Yugoslavian writer Dubravka Ugresic\u2014begins in the Berlin Zoo, with the contents of Roland the Walrus's stomach displayed beside his pool (Roland died in August, 1961). These objects\u2014a cigarette lighter, lollipop sticks, a beer-bottle opener, etc.\u2014like the fictional pieces of the novel itself, are seemingly random at first, but eventually coalesce, meaningfully and poetically.<br /><br /><br />Written in a variety of literary forms, <em>The Museum of Unconditional Surrender</em> captures the shattered world of a life in exile. Some chapters re-create the daily journal of the narrator's lonely and alienated mother, who shops at the improvised flea-markets in town and longs for her children; another is a dream-like narrative in which a circle of women friends are visited by an angel. There are reflections and accounts of the Holocaust and the Yugoslav Civil War; portraits of European artists; a recipe for Caraway Soup; a moving story of a romantic encounter the narrator has in Lisbon; descriptions of family photographs; memories of the small town in which Ugresic was raised.<br /><br /><br />Addressing the themes of art and history, aging and loss, <em>The Museum</em> is a haunting and an extremely original novel. In the words of the Times Literary Supplement, \"it is vivid in its denunciation of destructive forces and in its evocation of what is at stake.\"",

    "description": "These were the eight principal characters in whose company we are going to enable you to live, good reader. It is now time to divulge the object of singular pleasures that were proposed. It is commonly accepted amongst authentic libertines that the sensations communicated by the organs of hearing are the most flattering and those impressions are the liveliest; as a consequence, our four villains, who were of a mind to have voluptuousness implant itself in the very core of their beings as deeply and as overwhelmingly as ever it could penetrate, had, to this end, devised something quite clever indeed. It was this: after having immured themselves within everything that was best able to satisfy the senses through lust, after having established this situation, the plan was to have described to them, in the greatest detail and in due order, every one of debauchery's extravagances, all its divagations, all its ramifications, all its contingencies, all of what is termed in libertine language its passions. There is simply no conceiving the degree to which man varies them when his imagination grows inflamed; excessive may be the differences between men that is created by all their other manias, by all their other tastes, but in this case it is even more so, and he who should succeed in isolating and categorizing and detailing these follies would perhaps perform one of the most splendid labors which might be undertaken in the study of manners, and perhaps one of the most interesting.<br /><br />Introduced by Simone de Beauvoir's landmark essay, 'Must We Burn Sade?' Unique in its enduring capacity to shock and provoke, 'The 120 Days of Sodom' must stand as one of the most controversial books ever written. Edition includes 'Oxtiern, or The Misfortunes of Libertinage' and 'Ernestine'. Compiled and translated by Austryn Wainhouse and Richard Seaver. With introductions by Simone de Beauvoir and Pierre Klossowski.",

    "description": "Bestselling author of <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i>, James W. Loewen, exposes the secret communities and hotbeds of racial injustice that sprung up throughout the twentieth century unnoticed, forcing us to reexamine race relations in the United States.<br /><br />In this groundbreaking work, bestselling sociologist James W. Loewen, author of the national bestseller <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i>, brings to light decades of hidden racial exclusion in America. In a provocative, sweeping analysis of American residential patterns, Loewen uncovers the thousands of \u201csundown towns\u201d\u2014almost exclusively white towns where it was an unspoken rule that blacks could not live there\u2014that cropped up throughout the twentieth century, most of them located outside of the South. These towns used everything from legal formalities to violence to create homogenous Caucasian communities\u2014and their existence has gone unexamined until now. For the first time, Loewen takes a long, hard look at the history, sociology, and continued existence of these towns, contributing an essential new chapter to the study of American race relations.<br /><br /><i>Sundown Towns</i> combines personal narrative, history, and analysis to create a readable picture of this previously unknown American institution all written with Loewen\u2019s trademark honesty and thoroughness.",

    "description": "The three volumes of The Accursed Share address what Georges Bataille sees as the paradox of utility: namely, if being useful means serving a further end, then the ultimate end of utility can only be uselessness. In the second and third volumes, The History of Eroticism and Sovereignty, Bataille explores the same paradox of utility from an anthropological and an ethical perspective, respectively. The History of Eroticism analyzes the fears and fascination, the prohibitions and transgressions attached to the realm of eroticism as so many expressions of the \"uselessness\" of erotic life.",

    "description": "An ever-increasing proportion of our lives is spent in supermarkets, airports and hotels, on motorways or in front of TVs, computer and cash machines. This invasion of the world by what Marc Auge calls \u2018non-space\u2019 results in a profound alteration of awareness: something we perceive, but only in a partial and incoherent manner. Auge uses the concept of \u2018supermodernity\u2019 to describe the logic of these late-capitalist phenomena\u2014a logic of excessive information and excessive space. In this fascinating and lucid essay he seeks to establish and intellectual armature for an anthropology of supermodernity. Starting with an attempt to disentangle anthropology from history, Auge goes on to map the distinction between <i>place</i>, encrusted with historical monuments and creative social life, and <i>non-place</i>, to which individuals are connected in a uniform manner and where no organic social life is possible.<br /><br />Unlike Baudelairean modernity, where old and new are interwoven, supermodernity is self-contained: from the motorway or aircraft, local or exotic particularities are presented two-dimensionally as a sort of theme-park spectacle. Auge does not suggest that supermodernity is all-encompassing: place still exist outside non-place and tend to reconstitute themselves inside it. But he argues powerfully that we are in transit through non-place for more and more of our time, as if between immense parentheses, and concludes that this new form of solitude should become the subject of an anthropology of its own.",

    "description": "Set against the brilliantly drawn backdrop of India at the turn of the millennium, <em>The Alchemy of Desire</em> tells the story of a young couple, penniless but gloriously in love. Obsessed with each other, they move from a small town to the big city, where the man, who dreams of being a writer, works feverishly on a novel, stopping only to feed his ceaseless desire for his beautiful wife.<br /><br />A chance occurrence allows the lovers to abandon the city for a mist-shrouded spur of the lower Himalayas and move into a sprawling old house, which they hope will embody their love. At first they pursue their deep physical need with a reckless intensity. But during renovations of the house, a set of diaries written by the original inhabitant\u2014a glamorous American adventuress\u2014is unearthed, and the narrator finds himself irresistibly drawn away from his wife and thrust into another world and time, into the hole of history. As his life and love fall apart, he slowly begins to uncover the dark secrets at the heart of her story, until the shocking truth is laid bare and all certainties are overturned.<br /><br />Inventive, playful, heartbreaking, brimming with ideas and memorable characters, <em>The Alchemy of Desire</em> celebrates the chaotic spirit of a country during a time of great change. It also offers, in searing, lucid prose, a deeply sensual and moving meditation on the nature of desire, history, truth, and art. This is a major novel by one of the most significant new voices of his generation.",
