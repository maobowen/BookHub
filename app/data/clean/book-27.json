    "description": "Though the Kurds played a major military and tactical role in the United States\u2019 recent war with Iraq, most of us know little about this fiercely independent, long-marginalized people. Now acclaimed journalist Christiane Bird, who riveted readers with her tour of Islamic Iran in <i>Neither East Nor West</i>, travels through this volatile part of the world to tell the Kurds\u2019 story, using personal observations and in-depth research to illuminate an astonishing history and vibrant culture. <br /><br />For the twenty-five to thirty million Kurds, Kurdistan is both an actual and a mythical place: an isolated, largely mountainous homeland that has historically offered sanctuary from the treacherous outside world and yet does not exist on modern maps. Parceled out among the four nation-states of Iraq, Turkey, Syria, and Iran after World War I, Kurdistan is a divided land with a tragic history, where the indomitable Kurds both celebrate their ancient culture and fight to control their own destiny. Occupying some of the Middle East\u2019s most strategic and richest terrain, the Kurds are the fourth-largest ethnic group in the region and the largest ethnic group in the world without a state to call their own.<br /><br />Whether dancing at a Kurdish wedding in Iran, bearing witness to the destroyed Kurdish countryside in southeast Turkey, having lunch with a powerful exiled <i>agha</i> in Syria, or visiting the sites of Saddam Hussein\u2019s horrific chemical attacks in Iraq, the intrepid, insightful Bird sheds light on a violently stunning world seen by few Westerners. Part mesmerizing travelogue, part action-packed history, part reportage, and part cultural study, this critical book offers timely insight into an unknown but increasingly influential part of the world. Bird paints a moving and unforgettable portrait of a people uneasily poised between a stubborn past and an impatient future.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "Spring 1994, Washington, D.C. - While the Clinton Administration grapples with its domestic policies, a sinister plot is being masterminded six thousand miles away in Baghdad. By using $100 million as bait and spinning a deadly web of corruption, forgery, and terror, Saddam Hussein seeks to embarrass the U.S. with the ultimate revenge: to steal a treasured historical document and then destroy it before the world's media-on July 4, 1994.<br /><br />As the countdown to Independence Day begins, two agents stand in the way of his nearly flawless plan: Scott Bradley, a rising star in the CIA who is desperate to prove his patriotism, and Hannah Kopec, the stunning Mossad operative who has already lost o much that she fears nothing and trusts no one. Their unrelenting quest to prevent what would undoubtedly be the most humiliating day in U.S. history takes them across four continents and climaxes in a dramatic, triple-twist ending.<br /><br />Ingeniously plotted and as up-to-the-minute as today's headlines, <i>Honor Among Thieves</i> resonates with the brilliant pace that is the trademark of master storyteller Jeffrey Archer.",

    "description": "The Feller sisters are equal but opposite. Maggie is the good-looking, dyslexic little sister who knows how to get anything she wants--but not how to keep it. She \"felt as if somewhere between the ages of fourteen and sixteen she'd walked off the edge of a cliff and had been falling ever since.\" Rose is the plump, practical, responsible older sister who knows about law but not much about her own happiness: \"What did she like, besides shoes, and Jim, and foods that were bad for her?\" When Maggie's latest eviction lands her in Rose's apartment, and Maggie insults Rose by seducing one of her sister's rare boyfriends, what follows is a chain of events by turns hilarious and heartbreaking. Embarrassed Rose evicts Maggie and begins a work sabbatical leading to a new livelihood and way of living. Maggie flees and runs away to Princeton. Masquerading as a student, she learns to love poetry and saves money for a trip to Miami--and a visit to a long-lost grandmother named Ella who might offer her a last shot at sanctuary. But <i>In Her Shoes</i>, the second novel from <i>Good in Bed</i> author Jennifer Weiner, is about more than the sisters' latest sibling rivalry; Maggie and Rose must sort out the childhood vulnerabilities and family mysteries that still linger two decades after their mother's death. In less capable hands, the plot might grow corny, but Weiner's humor and affection for the characters ultimately helps them transcend both neuroses and grief and learn the redemptive power of love. <i>--Jane Hodges</i>",

The Japan she describes is not the sentimental world of Madame Butterfly but a vibrant land of real people with a complex culture and hardscrabble lives.",

Funny and optimistic.\"</b> <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br /><br />Mara Valentine is in control. She's a straight-A senior, a vegan, and her parents' pride and joy. She's neck-and-neck with her womanizing ex-boyfriend for number-one class ranking and plans to kick his salutatorian butt on her way out the door to Yale. Mara has her remaining months in Brockport all planned out, but the plan does not include having V, her slutty, pot-smoking, sixteen-year-old niece - yes, niece - come to live with her family. Nor does it involve lusting after her boss or dreaming about grilled cheese sandwiches every night. What does a control freak like Mara do when things start spinning wildly out of control? With insight, authenticity, and a healthy dose of humor, Carolyn Mackler creates an evolving Type A heroine that every reader will recognize - and root for.",

But that\u2019s before a shocking phone call \u2014 and a horrifying allegation \u2014 about her rugby-star brother changes everything. With irreverent humor and surprising gravity, Carolyn Mackler creates an endearingly blunt heroine who speaks to every teen who struggles with family expectations, and proves that the most impressive achievement is to be true to yourself.",

It is the gripping story of a woman's descent into devastating emptiness after being abandoned by her husband with two young children to care for.

But then again, how would you know? Isn't love supposed to be blind? Isn't it supposed to be about who the person really is, not about what they look like?\" <br /><p><br />The Year of Yes is an account of one woman's quest to find a man she can stand (for longer than a couple of hours). Frustrated by her own pitiful taste, writer Maria Headley decided to leave her love life up to fate, going out with everyone who asked her: homeless men, taxi drivers and yes, even a couple of women. Opening her heart and mind to the possibility that her perfect match might be the person she least expected, she spent twelve months dating most of New York City.</p>",

    "description": "How do we learn to die? Most of us spend our lives avoiding that question, but this luminous book--a major best-seller in France--answers it with a directness and eloquence that are nothing less than transforming. As a psychologist in a hospital for the terminally ill in Paris, Marie de Hennezel has spent seven years tending to people who are relinquishing their hold on life. <br /><br />She tells the stories of her patients and their families. de Hennezel teaches us how to turn death--our loved ones' or our own--from something lonely and agonizing into a sacred passage. She discusses the importance of an honest reckoning, the value of ritual, the necessity of touch. In imparting these lessons, <b>Intimate Death</b> becomes a guide to living more fully, more intensely, than we had thought possible.<br /><br />\"Unique...Of all the books I have read about the endings of our lives, this elegiac testimony has taught me the most.\"--Sherwin B. Nuland, M.D., author of <b>How We Die</b><br /><br />\"The quiet, obvious truths [de Hennezel] discovers in her work--these things have a kind of cumulative power.\"--Washington Post Book World",

    "description": "<i>Ender's Shadow</i> is being dubbed as a parallel novel to Orson Scott Card's Hugo and Nebula Award-winning <i>Ender's Game</i>. By \"parallel,\" Card means that <i>Shadow</i> begins and ends at roughly the same time as <i>Game</i>, and it chronicles many of the same events. In fact, the two books tell an almost identical story of brilliant children being trained in the orbiting Battle School to lead humanity's fleets in the final war against alien invaders known as the Buggers. The most brilliant of these young recruits is Ender Wiggin, an unparalleled commander and tactician who can surely defeat the Buggers if only he can overcome his own inner turmoil. <p> Second among the children is Bean, who becomes Ender's lieutenant despite the fact that he is the smallest and youngest of the Battle School students. Bean is the central character of <i>Shadow</i>, and we pick up his story when he is just a 2-year-old starving on the streets of a future Rotterdam that has become a hell on earth. Bean is unnaturally intelligent for his age, which is the only thing that allows him to escape--though not unscathed--the streets and eventually end up in Battle School. Despite his brilliance, however, Bean is doomed to live his life as an also-ran to the more famous and in many ways more brilliant Ender. Nonetheless, Bean learns things that Ender cannot or will not understand, and it falls to this once pathetic street urchin to carry the weight of a terrible burden that Ender must not be allowed to know.</p><p> Although it may seem like <i>Shadow</i> is merely an attempt by Card to cash in on the success of his justly famous <i>Ender's Game</i>, that suspicion will dissipate once you turn the first few pages of this engrossing novel. It's clear that Bean has a story worth telling, and that Card (who started the project with a cowriter but later decided he wanted it all to himself) is driven to tell it. And though much of <i>Ender's Game</i> hinges on a surprise ending that Card fans are likely well acquainted with, <i>Shadow</i> manages to capitalize on that same surprise and even turn the table on readers. In the end, it seems a shame that <i>Shadow</i>, like Bean himself, will forever be eclipsed by the myth of Ender, because this is a novel that can easily stand on its own. Luckily for readers, Card has left plenty of room for a sequel, so we may well be seeing more of Bean in the near future. <i>--Craig E. Engler</i></p>",

    "description": "Gripping listeners and readers for more than 2,700 years, 'The Iliad' is the story of the Trojan War and the rage of Achilles. Combining the skills of a poet and scholar, Robert Fagles brings the energy of contemporary language to this enduring heroic epic. <br /><br />If 'The Iliad' is the world's greatest war story, then 'The Odyssey' is literature's greatest evocation of every man's journey through life. Here again, Fagles has performed the translator's task magnificently, giving us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery. <br /><br />Each volume contains a superb introduction with textual and critical commentary by renowned classicist Bernard Knox.",

    "description": "Once Were Warriors is Alan Duff's harrowing vision of his country's indigenous people two hundred years after the English conquest. In prose that is both raw and compelling, it tells the story of Beth Heke, a Maori woman struggling to keep her family from falling apart, despite the squalor and violence of the housing projects in which they live. Conveying both the rich textures of Maori tradition and the wounds left by its absence, Once Were Warriors is a masterpiece of unblinking realism, irresistible energy, and great sorrow.",

A bad sign for anyone, but worse for Faith, an F-Psy with the highly sought after ability to predict the future. Then the visions show her something even more dangerous - aching need...exquisite pleasure. But so powerful is her sight, so fragile the state of her mind, that the very emotions she yearns to embrace could be the end of her.<br /><br />Changeling Vaughn D'Angelo can take the form of either man or jaguar, but it is his animal side that is overwhelmingly drawn to Faith. The jaguar's instinct is to claim this woman it finds so utterly fascinating and the man has no argument. But while Vaughn craves sensation and hungers to pleasure Faith in every way, desire is a danger that could snap the last threads of her sanity. And there are Psy who need Faith's sight for their own purposes. They must keep her silenced - and keep her from Vaughn.",

The icy and emotionless Psy are under the control of a powerful council of seven beings with very different goals.

I tend to write my novellas about secondary characters who were introduced in previous books \u2013 and quite often, this leads to the novella being set back in time.\n    \n    These novellas are all written to stand alone, but for those of you who like to read in strict chronological order, here it is:  (list updated on Feb 28, 2018) <a href=\"http://nalinisingh.com/extras/psy-changeling-behind-the-scenes/#psyfaq\">Full Information</a>\n    1. \u201cBeat of Temptation\u201d\n    2. \u201cWhisper of Sin\u201d \n    3.

But here she was, forced to join a serious and dangerous quest to recover that stolen Orb. No one believed in sorcery. Yet Garion's aunt and grandfather seemed to be the fabled sorcerers Polgara and Belgarath, who would have to be thousands of years old. Even young Garion was learning to do things that could only be sorcery.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Garion! He was nothing but a farm boy, totally unsuitable for an Imperial Princess. Then why did she have such an urge to teach him, to brush his tangled hair, and to comfort him?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Now he was going to a strange tower in the centre of all he believed evil, to face some horrible, powerful magician. And she wouldn't be there to watch over him. He might be killed! She'd never see him again...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />THUS CONTINUES BOOK THREE OF THE BELGARIAD",

    "description": "<i>Unrivaled storytelling...unforgettable characters...rich historical detail...these are the hallmarks of Diana Gabaldon's work. Her </i> New York Times<i> bestselling </i> Outlander<i> novels have earned the praise of critics and captured millions of readers. Here is the story that started it all, introducing two remarkable characters, Claire Randall and Jamie Fraser, in a spellbinding novel of passion and history that combines exhilarating adventure with a love story for the ages...</i><br /><br /><b>Outlander</b><br />The year is 1945. Claire Randall, a former combat nurse, is back from the war and reunited with her husband on a second honeymoon--when she walks through a standing stone in one of the ancient stone circles that dot the British Isles. Suddenly she is a Sassenach--an \"outlander\"--in a Scotland torn by war and raiding Highland clans in the year of Our Lord...1743.<br /><br />Hurled back in time by forces she cannot understand, Claire is catapulted into intrigues and dangers that may threaten her life...and shatter her heart. For here she meets James Fraser, a gallant young Scots warrior, and becomes a woman torn between fidelity and desire...and between two vastly different men in two irreconcilable lives.",

Nikolai knows that he wants to be the best person he can be, but often he is unsure if he is doing the right thing. So he goes to ask Leo, the wise turtle. When he arrives, the turtle is struggling to dig in his garden, and Nikolai rushes to help him. As he finishes work, a violent storm rolls in. Nikolai runs for Leo's cottage, but on his way, he hears cries for help from an injured panda. Nikolai brings her in from the cold, and then rushes back outside to rescue her baby too.",

    "description": "In <i>Teaching to Transgress</i>, bell hooks--writer, teacher, and insurgent black intellectual--writes about a new kind of education, educations as the practice of freedom. Teaching students to \"transgress\" against racial, sexual, and class boundaries in order to achieve the gift of freedom is, for hooks, the teacher's most important goal.<br /><br />Bell hooks speaks to the heart of education today: how can we rethink teaching practices in the age of multiculturalism? What do we do about teachers who do not want to teach, and students who do not want to learn? How should we deal with racism and sexism in the classroom?<br /><br />Full of passion and politics, <i>Teaching to Transgress</i> combines practical knowledge of the classroom with a deeply felt connection to the world of emotions and feelings. This is the rare book about teachers and students that dares to raise critical questions about eros and rage, grief and reconciliation, and the future o teaching its self.<br /><br />\"To educate as the practice of freedom,\" writes bell hooks, \"is a way of teaching that any one can learn.\" <i>Teaching to Transgress</i> is the record of one gifted teacher's struggle to make classrooms work.<br /><br />-from the back of the book",

    "description": "The aim of this book is to explain, carefully but not technically, the differences between advanced, research-level mathematics, and the sort of mathematics we learn at school. The most fundamental differences are philosophical, and readers of this book will emerge with a clearer understanding of paradoxical-sounding concepts such as infinity, curved space, and imaginary numbers. The first few chapters are about general aspects of mathematical thought. These are followed by discussions of more specific topics, and the book closes with a chapter answering common sociological questions about the mathematical community (such as \"Is it true that mathematicians burn out at the age of 25?\") It is the ideal introduction for anyone who wishes to deepen their understanding of mathematics.<br /><br /><strong>About the Series: </strong>Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions </strong>offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.<br />",

But that doesn't mean all is quiet for Falco, Helena, and their two young daughters.\u00a0</div>\n    <div>By trade he is an informer, a man who looks into sticky situations, and he's been hired to pry his errant brother-in-law away from a murder investigation.

With two woman already missing from the packaged tour, things only get stickier when two more - including Falco's brother-in-law - disappear in what is Falco's most complex and dangerous case yet.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>",

    "description": "The basic writings of Chuang Tzu have been savored by Chinese readers for over two thousand years. And Burton Watson's lucid and beautiful translation has been loved by generations of readers.<br /><br />Chuang Tzu (369?-286? B.C.) was a leading philosopher representing the Taoist strain in Chinese thought. Using parable and anecdote, allegory and paradox, he set forth, in the book that bears his name, the early ideas of what was to become the Taoist school. Central to these is the belief that only by understanding Tao (the Way of Nature) and dwelling in its unity can man achieve true happiness and freedom, in both life and death.<br /><br /><i>Chuang Tzu: Basic Writings</i> includes the seven \"inner chapters,\" which form the heart of the book, three of the \"outer chapters,\" and one of the \"miscellaneous chapters.\" Watson also provides an introduction, placing the philosopher in relation to Chinese history and thought.<br /><br />Witty and imaginative, enriched by brilliant imagery, and making sportive use of both mythological and historical personages (including even Confucius), this timeless classic is sure to appeal to anyone interested in Chinese religion and culture.",

    "description": "After three decades of prodigious film work &amp; some unfortunate tabloid adventures, it's easy to forget that Woody Allen began his career as one heck of a great comedy writer. Getting Even, a collection of his late '60s magazine pieces, offers a look into Allen's bag of shtick, back when it was new. From the supposed memoirs of Hitler's barber: \"Then, in January of '45, a plot by several generals to shave Hitler's moustache in his sleep failed when von Stauffenberg, in the darkness of Hitler's bedroom, shaved off one of the F\u00fchrer's eyebrows instead...\" Even tho the idea of writing jokes about old Adolf--or addled rabbis, or Maatjes herring--isn't nearly as fresh as it used to be, Getting Even still delivers plenty of laughs. At his best, Woody can achieve a level of transcendent craziness that no other writer can match. If you're looking for a book to dip into at random, or a gift for someone who's seen Sleeper 13 times, Getting Even is a classic, with 316,000 copies sold to date.",

In the years since she arrived at Green Gables as a freckle-faced orphan, she has earned the love of the people of Avonlea and a reputation for getting into scrapes. But when Anne begins her job as the new schoolteacher, the real test of her character begins. Along with teaching the three Rs, she is learning how complicated life can be when she meddles in someone else's romance, finds two new orphans at Green Gables, and wonders about the strange behavior of the very handsome Gilbert Blythe. As Anne enters womanhood, her adventures touch the heart and the funny bone.",

Within this era of danger and romance, John of Gaunt, the king\u2019s son, falls passionately in love with the already married Katherine. Their well-documented affair and love persist through decades of war, adultery, murder, loneliness, and redemption. This epic novel of conflict, cruelty, and untamable love has become a classic since its first publication in 1954.<br />",

It turns out that her adopted son is responsible for the dead hoopoe bird in the garden; her assistant, Mma Makutsi, wants a husband and needs help with her idea to open the Kalahari Typing School for Men; yet Mma Ramotswe\u2019s sexist rival has no trouble opening his Satisfaction Guaranteed Detective Agency across town. Will Precious Ramotswe\u2019s delightfully cunning and profoundly moral methods save the day? Follow the continuing story of Botswana\u2019s first lady detective in the irresistible The Kalahari Typing School for Men.",

    "description": "Resurrection (1899) is the last of Tolstoy's major novels. It tells the story of a nobleman's attempt to redeem the suffering his youthful philandering inflicted on a peasant girl who ends up a prisoner in Siberia. Tolstoy's vision of redemption, achieved through loving forgiveness and his condemnation of violence, dominate the novel. An intimate, psychological tale of guilt, anger, and forgiveness, Resurrection is at the same time a panoramic description of social life in Russia at the end of the nineteenth century, reflecting its author's outrage at the social injustices of the world in which he lived. This edition, which updates a classic translation, has explanatory notes, and a substantial introduction based on the most recent scholarship in the field.",

    "description": "For decades the Magistrate has been a loyal servant of the Empire, running the affairs of a tiny frontier settlement and ignoring the impending war with the barbarians. When interrogation experts arrive, however, he witnesses the Empire's cruel and unjust treatment of prisoners of war. Jolted into sympathy for their victims, he commits a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state.J. M. Coetzee's prize-winning novel is a startling allegory of the war between opressor and opressed. The Magistrate is not simply a man living through a crisis of conscience in an obscure place in remote times; his situation is that of all men living in unbearable complicity with regimes that ignore justice and decency.",

    "description": "Recently recovered from a catastrophic car accident, fashion model Charlotte Swenson returns to life in Manhattan. Her beautiful face conceals eighty titanium screws that hold together her shattered bones. Charlotte, now unrecognizable to those who knew her before the accident, begins to float invisibly away from her former life and into an ephemeral world of fashion nightclubs and Internet projects, where image and reality blur. Look at Me is both a satire of our image-obsessed times and a mystery of human identity. Jennifer Egan illuminates the difficulties of shaping an inner life in a culture preoccupied with surfaces and asks whether 'truth' can have any meaning in an era when reality itself has become a style. Written with a masterful intelligence and grace, Look at Me establishes Jennifer Egan as one of the most daring and gifted novelists of her generation.",

    "description": "\"Mitford's funny and unforgiving book is the best memento mori we are likely to get.\u00a0\u00a0It should be updated and reissued each decade for our spiritual health.\"--<i>The New York Review of Books</i><br /><br />Only the scathing wit and searching intelligence of Jessica Mitford could turn an expos\u00e9 of the American funeral industry into a book that is at once deadly serious and side-splittingly funny. When first published in 1963 this landmark of investigative journalism became a runaway bestseller and resulted in legislation to protect grieving families from the unscrupulous sales practices of those in \"the dismal trade.\"<br /><br />Just before her death in 1996, Mitford thoroughly revised and updated her classic study. <b>The American Way of Death Revisited</b> confronts new trends, including the success of the profession's lobbyists in Washington, inflated cremation costs, the telemarketing of pay-in-advance graves, and the effects of monopolies in a death-care industry now dominated by multinational corporations. With its hard-nosed consumer activism and a satiric vision out of Evelyn Waugh's novel <b>The Loved One</b>, <b>The American Way of Death Revisited</b> will not fail to inform, delight, and disturb. <br /><br />\"Brilliant--hilarious--A must-read for anyone planning to throw a funeral in their lifetime.\"--<i>New York Post</i><br /><br />\"Witty and penetrating--it speaks the truth.\"--<i>The Washington Post</i>",

    "description": "Diana Mosley was a society beauty who fell from grace when she left her husband, brewery heir Bryan Guinness, for Sir Oswald Mosley, an admirer of Mussolini and a notorious womanizer. This horrified her family and scandalized society.<br /><br />In 1933, Diana met the new German leader, Adolf Hitler. They became close friends and he attended her wedding as the guest of honor. During the war, the Mosleys' association with Hitler led them to be arrested and interned for three and a half years. Diana's relationships with Hitler and Mosley defined her life in the public eye and marked her as a woman who possessed a singular lack of empathy for those less blessed at birth.<br /><br />Anne de Courcy's revealing biography chronicles one of the most intriguing, controversial women of the twentieth century. It is a riveting tell-all memoir of a leading society hostess, a woman with intimate access to the highest literary, political, and social circles of her time. Written with Mosley's exclusive cooperation and based upon hundreds of hours of taped interviews and unprecedented access to her private papers, letters, and diaries, Lady Mosley's only stipulation was that the book not be published until after her death.",

    "description": "The Season of 1939 brought all those 'in Society' to London. The young debutante daughters of the upper classes were presented to the King and Queen to mark their acceptance into the new adult world of their parents. They sparkled their way through a succession of balls and parties and sporting events. The Season brought together influential people not only from Society but also from Government at the various events of the social calendar. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain chaperoned his debutante niece to weekend house parties; Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary, lunched with the Headmaster of Eton; Cabinet Ministers encountered foreign Ambassadors at balls in the houses of the great hostesses. As the hot summer drew on, the newspapers filled with ever more ominous reports of the relentless progress towards war. There was nothing to do but wait - and dance. The last season of peace was nearly over.",

Conceived as one of Graham Greene's 'entertainments,' it tells of MI6's man in Havana, Wormold, a former vacuum-cleaner salesman turned reluctant secret agent out of economic necessity. To keep his job, he files bogus reports based on Lamb's <i>Tales from Shakespeare</i> and dreams up military installations from vacuum-cleaner designs. Then his stories start coming disturbingly true.<br /><br /></div>",

    "description": "The most up-to-date and wide-ranging history of art ever published in a single volume, \"The Visual Arts: A History\" presents art as an integrated dimension of human activity. With insight and elegance, it offers an authoritative, balanced, and stimulating account of the arts - ranging from a statuette carved in central Europe some 30,000 years ago to contemporary installation pieces by Jenny Holzer and Gary Hill. The scope is international, including the art of Asia, Africa, and Oceania. The fine arts are represented of course, by painting, mosaic, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, architecture, and photography. But so are other arts: textiles, coins, pottery, enamels, gold and silver work, Earth and Land Art, Body and Video Art, to name a few.",

For considering his wife\u2019s untimely death the ultimate betrayal, Baron Von Rothbart scours the land in the shape of a great bird of prey. His personal mission is to capture woman who arouse his wrath and inspire his rage for vengeance against all womankind. These poor souls he turns into swans\u2014forcing them to spend their lives as beautiful but powerless animals who only regain their human forms briefly each night by the transitory light of the moon.<br /><br />Yet though Odile is terrified of him, she has learned far more than her father, the baron, intended to teach her\u2014both of the magical arts and of Von Rothbart\u2019s idiosyncratic nature. And both as a woman and the guardian of his swan flock, her heart goes out to each and every young maiden ensorcelled by her vindictive father.<br /><br />And then the noblest of Von Rothbart\u2019s enchanted flock, the Princess Odette, finds the courage to confront her captor, wresting from him a pact which could lead to freedom for herself and all the swan-maidens. Knowing Von Rothbart will use all of his magical cunning to avoid honoring this pact, will Odile have the strength to face him in a final magical confrontation which, if she fails, will lead to her death and the murder of all in her flock?",

The moments you know - when you see your parents' marriage dissolving, when you realize you're a boy who likes boys, when you speak the truth and don't know if it will be heard. The moments you don't recognize until later - when you leave things unsaid (even to yourself), when you feel your boyfriend letting go, when you give up on love. And the moment you get love back.</p><p> In an amazing narrative of poems, Billy Merrell tells an ordinary story in an extraordinary way.</p></div>",

They were shocked, barely comprehending. <br /><br />Me? I sat there and beamed. <br /><br />Everything seems to be going right in Duncan's life: The candidate he's been supporting for president has just won the election. Duncan's boyfriend, Jimmy, is with him to celebrate. Love and kindness appear to have won the day.<br /><br />But all too quickly, things start to go wrong. The election is called into question... and Duncan and Jimmy's relationship is called into question, too. Suddenly Duncan has to decide what he's willing to risk for something he believes in... and how far he's willing to go to hold on to the people we hold dear.",

Ondaatje left Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) at the age of eleven. Almost twenty-five years later, he returned to sort out the recollected fragments of experience, legend, and family scandal, and to reconstruct the carefree, doomed life his parents and grandparents had led in a place where couples danced the tango in the moonlight, where drink, gambling, and romance were the main occupations of the upper class. Rich with eccentric characters and captivating stories, and set against the exotic landscape of a colonial empire in decline, <i>Running in the Family</i> is Ondaatje\u2019s unforgettable journey through memory and imagination to reclaim his past.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "Sixteen-year-old Elijah is completely mellow and his 23-year-old brother Danny is completely not, so it\u2019s no wonder they can barely tolerate one another. So what better way to repair their broken relationship than to trick them into taking a trip to Italy together? Soon, though, their parents\u2019 perfect solution has become Danny and Elijah\u2019s nightmare as they\u2019re forced to spend countless hours <i>together</i>. But then Elijah meets Julia, and soon the brothers aren\u2019t together nearly as much. And then Julia meets Danny and soon all three of them are in a mixed-up, turned-around, never-what-you-expect world of brothers, Italy, and love.<br /><br /><i>Are We There Yet?</i> isn\u2019t about a place on a map, it\u2019s about a place in the heart. David Levithan has written a magical story of a journey definitely worth taking.",

With his blond curls and his naked ambition he is determined to be more woman than most, and to match his idol, rival, and mother, Sarah. Adopting her name and sex, he heads off into the dangerous and fantastic worlds pocketed away in the West Virginian wilds. On his journey for fame he meets with sinister pimps, luck-restoring Jack-a-lopes, superstitious prostitutes who take him for a saint, and a host of bizarre and beautiful outcasts that make up his unusual, heartbreaking world.",

She\u2019s made a mistake so huge, it\u2019ll wreck any chance of a partnership. <br /><br />Going into utter meltdown, she walks out of her London office, gets on a train, and ends up in the middle of nowhere. Asking for directions at a big, beautiful house, she\u2019s mistaken for an interviewee and finds herself being offered a job as housekeeper. Her employers have no idea they\u2019ve hired a lawyer\u2013and Samantha has no idea how to work the oven. She can\u2019t sew on a button, bake a potato, or get the #@%# ironing board to open. How she takes a deep breath and begins to cope\u2013and finds love\u2013is a story as delicious as the bread she learns to bake. <br /><br />But will her old life ever catch up with her? And if it does\u2026will she want it back?",

An extensive and comprehensive introduction explains the central concepts of Groundwork and looks at Kant's main lines of argument. Detailed notes aim to clarify Kant's thoughts and to correct some common misunderstandings of his doctrines.",

    "description": "In her remarkable debut novel . . . Manette Ansay writes with startling authority and quiet elegance of one woman's gradual realization that in order to reenvision her life she must break all the rules. It is 1972 and Ellen Grier finds herself back in the Midwestern hometown she thought she had escaped for good. Worse yet, she and her family have had to move in with her in-laws: narrow-minded, eccentric people who are as tough as the farm lives they have endured. Devout Catholics, they inhabit a world \"as rigid, as precise as a church, \" and Ellen struggles to live by their motto: \"A place for everything; everything in its place.\" But there is no place for Ellen -- fresh, funny, bright with passion -- in a house filled with the dust of routine and the ritual of prayer, the lingering bitterness of her in-laws' loveless marriage. She tries to be the model woman everyone expects her to be -- teaching at the Catholic school, coaxing her traveling-salesman husband through his increasingly irrational moods, caring for his aging parents -- but Ellen's hopes for her family's future collide with life in this bizarre household, and she worries over her wryly observant adolescent daughter and her timid young son. Encouraged by her friend Barb, a woman ostracized for being \"modern\" and \"wild, \" Ellen begins to consider her own desires and dreams as well. Surrounded by the family's obsession with an exacting, angry God and the disquieting ghosts of the past, Ellen searches for a way to satisfy the demands of this rural community and its traditions until, at last, she discovers the family's darkest secret, one that frees her and changes her life forever.",

Flash Hugo and Amanda want smart private hospitals and maternity nurses to the stars. Ultra-green Alice and Jake want an all-natural home birth with whale music and tree-hugging nappies.<br /><br />Yet parenthood doesn't quite go to plan. Amanda soon decides being a mummy is less yummy than Gwyneth Paltrow makes it look. Hugo fails miserably to bond with his son and when Amanda disappears to resume her hot-shot career, he's left literally holding the baby with no idea what to do. Being constantly faced with sickening superdad Jake hardly helps his confidence.<br /><br />Blissed-out new mother Alice has problems too. Jake's increasingly rampant right-on-ness has them drinking from jam jars and spending Christmas with a recycled-cardboard tree.<br /><br />Will Alice and Hugo cope, let alone find happiness? Not before secret affairs, scheming spouses, beastly bosses and nympho nursery mothers have done their terrible worst...",

    "description": "The bestselling author of <b>Birdsong</b><i> </i>and <b>Charlotte Gray</b><i> </i>delivers an enthralling, vibrantly evocative novel set in America in 1960, when the country stood poised between the paranoia of the Cold War and the ebullience of the New Frontier.<br /><br />Faulks' heroine is Mary Van der Linden, a pretty, reserved Englishwoman whose husband, Charlie, is posted to the British embassy in Washington. One night at a cocktail party Mary meets Frank Renzo, a reporter who has covered stories from the fall of Dienbienphu to the Emmett Till murder trial in Mississippi. Slowly, reluctantly, they fall in love. Their ensuing affair, in all its desperate elation, plays out against a backdrop that ranges from the jazz clubs of Greenwich Village to the smoke-filled rooms of the Kennedy campaign. A romance in the grand tradition that is also a neon-lit portrait of America at its apogee, <b>On Green Dolphin Street</b> is Sebastian Faulks at the peak of his powers.",

    "description": "This haunting, suspenseful tale of love and vengeance by the author of the international bestseller <i>Silk</i> surges with the hypnotic power of the ocean sea. <br /><br />In <i>Ocean Sea</i>, Alessandro Baricco presents a hypnotizing postmodern fable of human malady--psychological, existential, erotic--and the sea as a means of deliverance. At the Almayer Inn, a remote shoreline hotel, an artist dips his brush in a cup of ocean water to paint a portrait of the sea. A scientist pens love letters to a woman he has yet to meet. An adulteress searches for relief from her proclivity to fall in love. And a sixteen-year-old girl seeks a cure from a mysterious condition which science has failed to remedy. When these people meet, their fates begin to interact as if by design. Enter a mighty tempest and a ghostly mariner with a thirst for vengeance, and the Inn becomes a place where destiny and desire battle for the upper hand. Playful, provocative, and ultimately profound, Ocean Sea is a novel of striking originality and wisdom.",

    "description": "Published when Truman Capote was only twenty-three years old, <i>Other Voices, Other Rooms</i> is a literary touchstone of the mid-twentieth century. In this semiautobiographical coming-of-age novel, thirteen-year-old Joel Knox, after losing his mother, is sent from New Orleans to live with the father who abandoned him at birth. But when Joel arrives at Skully\u2019s Landing, the decaying mansion in rural Alabama, his father is nowhere to be found. Instead, Joel meets his morose stepmother, Amy, eccentric cousin Randolph, and a defiant little girl named Idabel, who soon offers Joel the love and approval he seeks.<br /><br />Fueled by a world-weariness that belied Capote\u2019s tender age, this novel tempers its themes of waylaid hopes and lost innocence with an appreciation for small pleasures and the colorful language of its time and place.<br /><br />This new edition, featuring an enlightening Introduction by John Berendt, offers readers a fresh look at Capote\u2019s emerging brilliance as a writer of protean power and effortless grace.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

Initially she faced the death penalty. She spent 4-1/2 years in the notorious Lard Yao women's prison - dubbed the Bangkok Hilton - before being repatriated in 1997 to serve the rest of her sentence in Britain. In Lard Yao Gregory shared a cell with 170 prisoners. Space was so cramped she had to pull her knees up to her chest when lying down. An open sewer ran around three sides of the compound where inmates wash clothes and dishes in filthy water. Prison in Britain was no better - she was in a cell 'like a gerbil cage under a system she portrays as a slow torture - being kept alive to suffer slowly. She was freed in July 2000 after being granted a royal pardon by the King of Thailand. Shortly after her capture she wrote to her parents requesting t",

    "description": "When an epidemic threatens to destroy the silk trade in France, the young merchant Herve Joncour leaves his doting wife and his comfortable home in the small town of Lavilledieu and travels across Siberia to the other end of the world, to Japan, to obtain eggs for a fresh breeding of silk worms. It is the 1860s; Japan is closed to foreigners and this has to be a clandestine operation. During his undercover negotiations with the local baron, Joncour's attention is arrested by the man's concubine, a girl who does not have Oriental eyes. Although the young Frenchman and the girl are unable to exchange so much as a word, love blossoms between them, conveyed by a number of recondite messages in the course of four visits the Frenchman pays to Japan. How their secret affair develops and how it unfolds is told in a narration as beautiful, smooth and seamless as a piece of the finest silk.",

    "description": "Set against the sweeping panoply of Napoleon's invasion of Russia, War and Peace, presented here in the first new English translation in forty years, is often considered the greatest novel ever written. At its center are Pierre Bezukhov, searching for meaning in his life; cynical Prince Andrei, ennobled by wartime suffering; and Natasha Rostov, whose impulsiveness threatens to destroy her happiness. As Tolstoy follows the changing fortunes of his characters, he crafts a view of humanity that is both epic and intimate and that continues to define fiction at its most resplendent.<br /><br />Includes an introduction, note on the translation, cast of characters, maps, notes on the major battles depicted, and chapter summaries",

Based on living systems thinking, this innovative approach creates dynamic networks of conversation that can catalyze an organization or community's own collective intelligence around its most important questions.<br /> Filled with stories of actual Cafe dialogues in business, education, government, and community organizations across the globe, this uniquely crafted book demonstrates how the World Cafe can be adapted to any setting or culture. Examples from such varied organizations as Hewlett-Packard, American Society for Quality, the nation of Singapore, the University of Texas, and many others, demonstrate the process in action.<br /> Along with its seven core design principles, The World Cafe offers practical tips for hosting \"conversations that matter\" in groups of any size- strengthening both personal relationships and people's capacity to shape the future together.",

    "description": "Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering, whereas machine learning grew out of computer science. However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field, and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years. In particular, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic models. Also, the practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced through the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation. Similarly, new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners, and assumes no previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts. Knowledge of multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some familiarity with probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.",

    "description": "<b>A <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Favorite Book of the Year for 2005.</b><br /><br /><br />Gregory Rabassa's influence as a translator is tremendous. His translations of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> and Julio Cortazar's <i>Hopscotch</i> have helped make these some of the the most widely read and respected works in world literature. (Garcia Marquez was known to say that the English translation of <i>One Hundred Years</i> was better than the Spanish original.) In <i>If This Be Treason: Translation and Its Dyscontents</i>, Rabassa offers a cool- headed and humorous defense of translation, laying out his views on the translator's art. Anecdotal and always illuminating, Rabassa traces his career from a boyhood on a New Hampshire farm, his school days \"collecting\" languages, the two and a half years he spent overseas during WWII, and his South American travels, until one day \"I signed a contract to do my first translation of a long work [Cortazar's <i>Hopscotch</i>] for a commercial publisher.\" Additionally, Rabassa offers us his \"rap sheet,\" a consideration of the various authors and the over 40 works he has translated. This long-awaited memoir is a joy to read, an instrumental guide to translating, and a look at the life of one of its great practitioners.",

    "description": "Connie Willis' Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Doomsday Book uses time travel for a serious look at how people connect with each other. In this Hugo-winning companion to that novel, she offers a completely different kind of time travel adventure: a delightful romantic comedy that pays hilarious homage to Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat.<br /><br />When too many jumps back to 1940 leave 21st century Oxford history student Ned Henry exhausted, a relaxing trip to Victorian England seems the perfect solution. But complexities like recalcitrant rowboats, missing cats, and love at first sight make Ned's holiday anything but restful - to say nothing of the way hideous pieces of Victorian art can jeopardize the entire course of history.",

    "description": "\"The most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed.\" Like all of Steve Biko's writings, those words testify to the passion, courage, and keen insight that made him one of the most powerful figures in South Africa's struggle against apartheid. They also reflect his conviction that black people in South Africa could not be liberated until they united to break their chains of servitude, a key tenet of the Black Consciousness movement that he helped found.<br /><br /><i>I Write What I Like</i> contains a selection of Biko's writings from 1969, when he became the president of the South African Students' Organization, to 1972, when he was prohibited from publishing. The collection also includes a preface by Archbishop Desmond Tutu; an introduction by Malusi and Thoko Mpumlwana, who were both involved with Biko in the Black Consciousness movement; a memoir of Biko by Father Aelred Stubbs, his longtime pastor and friend; and a new foreword by Professor Lewis Gordon.<br /><br />Biko's writings will inspire and educate anyone concerned with issues of racism, postcolonialism, and black nationalism.<br /><br />",

    "description": "Just out of college, Patricia Hampl was mesmerized by a Matisse painting she saw in the Art Institute of Chicago: an aloof woman gazing at goldfish in a bowl, a mysterious Moroccan screen behind her. This woman seemed a welcome secular version of the nuns of Hampl\u2019s girlhood, free and untouchable, a poster girl for twentieth-century feminism. In <i>Blue Arabesque,</i> Hampl explores the allure of that woman, immersed in leisure, so at odds with the increasing rush of the modern era. Her tantalizing meditation takes us to the Cote d\u2019Azur and North Africa, from cloister to harem, pondering figures as diverse as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Katherine Mansfield. Returning always to Matisse and his obsessive portraits of languid women, Hampl discovers they were not decorative indulgences but surprising acts of integrity. <br />\u00a0<br />Moving with the life force that Matisse sought in his work, <i>Blue Arabesque</i> is a dazzling tour de force. <br />",

Now local enterprise of a different sort flourishes: drug dealers and prostitutes of every flavour. But their discreet trade is upset when two employees of the Splendour Refuse Collection Company discover the body of engineer Silvio Luparello, one of the local movers and shakers, apparently deceased <i>in flagrante</i> at the Pasture. The coroner's verdict is death from natural causes - refreshingly unusual for Sicily.</p><p> But Inspector Salvo Montalbano, as honest as he is streetwise and as scathing to fools and villains as he is compassionate to their victims, is not ready to close the case - even though he's being pressured by Vig\u00e0ta's police chief, judge, and bishop.</p><p> Picking his way through a labyrinth of high-comedy corruption, delicious meals, vendetta firepower, and carefully planted false clues, Montalbano can be relied on, whatever the cost, to get to the heart of the matter.</p><p><i>The Shape of Water</i> is followed by the second in this phenomenal series, <i>The Terracotta Dog</i>.</p>",

Montalbano's passion to solve this old crime takes him, heedless of personal danger, on a journey through the island's past and into a family's dark heart amid the horrors of World War II.",

    "description": "<b>Warning: Watch your wallets and stay out of the bathroom!</b> <br /> In a bygone era, when Times Square was crammed with porn shops, gun stores, and drug pushers, disenfranchised moviegoers flocked to the grindhouses along 42nd Street. If the gore epics, women-in-prison films, and shockumentaries showcased within their mildewed walls didn't live up to their outrageous billing, the audience shouted, threw food, and even vandalized the theaters. For dedicated lovers of extreme cinema, buying a movie ticket on the Deuce meant putting your life on the line. <br /> Authors Bill Landis and Michelle Clifford came to know those grindhouses better than anyone else, and although the theaters were gone by the mid-1980s, the films remained. In <i>Sleazoid Express,</i> Landis and Clifford reproduce what no home video can -- the experience of watching an exploitation film in its original fight-for-your-life Deuce setting. Both a travelogue of the infamous grindhouses of yore and a comprehensive overview of the sleaze canon, Sleazoid Express offers detailed reviews of landmark exploitation classics and paints intimate portraits of directors whose notorious creations played the back end of triple bills for years on end. With wit, intelligence, and an unflinching eye, Landis and Clifford offer the definitive document of cinema's most intense and shocking moments as they came to life at a legendary place.",

    "description": "<i>If on a Winter's Night a Traveler</i> is a marvel of ingenuity, an experimental text that looks longingly back to the great age of narration\u2014\"when time no longer seemed stopped and did not yet seem to have exploded.\" Italo Calvino's novel is in one sense a comedy in which the two protagonists, the Reader and the Other Reader, ultimately end up married, having almost finished <i>If on a Winter's Night a Traveler.</i> In another, it is a tragedy, a reflection on the difficulties of writing and the solitary nature of reading. The Reader buys a fashionable new book, which opens with an exhortation: \"Relax. Concentrate. Dispel every other thought. Let the world around you fade.\" Alas, after 30 or so pages, he discovers that his copy is corrupted, and consists of nothing but the first section, over and over. Returning to the bookshop, he discovers the volume, which he thought was by Calvino, is actually by the Polish writer Bazakbal. Given the choice between the two, he goes for the Pole, as does the Other Reader, Ludmilla. But this copy turns out to be by yet another writer, as does the next, and the next.<br /><br />The real Calvino intersperses 10 different pastiches\u2014stories of menace, spies, mystery, premonition\u2014with explorations of how and why we choose to read, make meanings, and get our bearings or fail to. Meanwhile the Reader and Ludmilla try to reach, and read, each other. <i>If on a Winter's Night</i> is dazzling, vertiginous, and deeply romantic. \"What makes lovemaking and reading resemble each other most is that within both of them times and spaces open, different from measurable time and space.\"",

All she really wants to do is ride the metro, but finding it shut because of a strike, Zazie looks for other means of amusement and is soon caught up in a comic adventure that becomes wilder and more manic by the minute. <br /><br />In 1960 Queneau's cult classic was made into a hugely successful film by Louis Malle. Packed full of word play and phonetic games, 'Zazie in the Metro' remains as stylish and witty now as it did back then.",

This cityscape, as Carlos Fuentes describes it, \"seems drawn up by the Marx Brothers with an assist from Bela Lugosi!\" It is the meeting place for a wild assortment of bohemians in a novel described by The New York Times as \"Deeply touching, enjoyable, beautifully written and fascinatingly mysterious.\" Library Journal has said 62: A Model Kit is \"a highly satisfying work by one of the most extraordinary writers of our time.\"",

    "description": "From a helicopter high above the empty California desert, a man is sent free-falling into the night\u2026. In Chicago, a woman learns that an elite team of ex\u2013army investigators is being hunted down one by one.... And on the streets of Portland, Jack Reacher\u2014soldier, cop, hero\u2014is pulled out of his wandering life by a code that few other people could understand. From the first shocking scenes in Lee Child\u2019s explosive new novel, Jack Reacher is plunged like a knife into the heart of a conspiracy that is killing old friends\u2026and is on its way to something even worse.<br /><br />A decade postmilitary, Reacher has an ATM card and the clothes on his back\u2014no phone, no ties, and no address. But now a woman from his old unit has done the impossible. From Chicago, Frances Neagley finds Reacher, using a signal only the eight members of their elite team of army investigators would know. She tells him a terrifying story\u2014about the brutal death of a man they both served with. Soon Reacher is reuniting with the survivors of his old team, scrambling to raise the living, bury the dead, and connect the dots in a mystery that is growing darker by the day. The deeper they dig, the more they don\u2019 t know: about two other comrades who have suddenly gone missing\u2014and a trail that leads into the neon of Vegas and the darkness of international terrorism.<br /><br />For now, Reacher can only react. To every sound. Every suspicion. Every scent and every moment. Then Reacher will trust the people he once trusted with his life\u2014and take this thing all the way to the end. Because in a world of bad luck and trouble, when someone targets Jack Reacher and his team, they\u2019d better be ready for what comes right back at them\u2026",

Included among the illustrations are more than eighty full\u2013color paintings, as well as dozens of black\u2013and\u2013white pictures and line illustrations. Among the famous and little\u2013known works included in Frida Kahlo: The Paintings are The Two Fridas, Self\u2013Portrait as a Tehuana, Without Hope, The Dream, The Little Deer, Diego and I, Henry Ford Hospital, My Birth, and My Nurse and I. Here, too, are documentary photographs of Frida Kahlo and her world that help to illuminate the various stages of her life.",

Here are previously unpublished stories - wacky as they are enlightening - along with favorites from Walking Through Clear Water in a Pool Painted Black and other publications. Also the best of Cookie?s art columns from Details magazine, and the funniest of her advice columns from the East Village Eye, on everything from homeopathic medicine to how to cut your cocaine with a healthy substance. This collection is as much an autobiography as it is a map of downtown New York in the early ?80s - that moment before Bright Lights, Big City, before the art world exploded, before New York changed into a yuppie metropolis, while it still had a glimmer of bohemian life.",

    "description": "When Pushkin first read some of the stories in this collection, he declared himself \"amazed.\"\u00a0\u00a0\"Here is real gaiety,\" he wrote, \"honest, unconstrained, without mincing, without primness. And in places what poetry! . . . I still haven't recovered.\"<br /><br />More than a century and a half later, Nikolai Gogol's stories continue to delight readers the world over. Now a stunning new translation--from an award-winning team of translators--presents these stories in all their inventive, exuberant glory to English-speaking readers. For the first time, the best of Gogol's short fiction is brought together in a single volume: from the colorful Ukrainian tales that led some critics to call him \"the Russian Dickens\" to the Petersburg stories, with their black humor and wonderfully demented attitude toward the powers that be. All of Gogol's most memorable creations are here: the minor official who misplaces his nose, the downtrodden clerk whose life is changed by the acquisition of a splendid new overcoat, the wily madman who becomes convinced that a dog can tell him everything he needs to know.<br /><br />These fantastic, comic, utterly Russian characters have dazzled generations of readers and had a profound influence on writers such as Dostoevsky and Nabokov. Now they are brilliantly rendered in the first new translation in twenty-five years--one that is destined to become the definitive edition of Gogol's most important stories.",

    "description": "<i>'There's only one way for a female to be recognize in this man's world ... and that's to fight every inch of the way. You can never stop fighting. I fought and I'm still fighting and I'll be fighting until my dying day'</i> -- BETTE DAVIS <br /><br />Hollywood always liked its female stars to be feminine, agreeable and pretty. Bette Davis was never a typical Hollywood star. She was tough, smart, aggressive, gifted and bitterly determined. It was those qualities that made her one of the most legendary and charismatic actresses of her generation. But the stormy personality that drove her to the top knew no rest behind the scenes, and those same qualities damned her personal life right from the start. <br /><br />The broken marriages, the domestic violence and unhappiness, the vicious battles with The System, the conflicts with other stars, the personal dissatisfaction and obsessiveness, the loneliness behind the accolades - all of it is here, told by the only person who knows Bette Davis well enough to tell it, her daughter, B.D. Hyman. <br /><br />Written with compassion, humour, understanding and searing honesty, this is the story of the real Bette Davis - more controversial, more shocking and more moving than any character she ever played on film.",

Fruits was established in 1994, by photographer Shoich Aoki, initially as a project to document the growing explosion in street fashion within the suburbs of Tokyo. The magazine has since grown to cult status and is now avidly followed by thousands of Japanese teenagers who also use the magazine as an opportunity to check out the latest styles and trends. The average age of the kids featured in the magazine is between 12 and 18 years and the clothes they wear are a mixture of high fashion - Vivienne Westwood is a keen favourite - and home-made ensembles which, when combined, create a novel, if not hysterical, effect.",

    "description": "A bestseller when it was originally published nearly a century ago, Wharton's first literary success was set amid the previously unexplored territory of fashionable, turn-of-the-century New York society, an area with which she was intimately familiar.<br /><br />The tragic love story reveals the destructive effects of wealth and social hypocrisy on Lily Bart, a ravishing beauty. Impoverished but well-born, Lily realizes a secure future depends on her acquiring a wealthy husband. Her downfall begins with a romantic indiscretion, intensifies with an accumulation of gambling debts, and climaxes in a maelstrom of social disasters.<br /><br />More a tale of social exclusion than of failed love, <i>The House of Mirth</i> reveals Wharton's compelling gifts as a storyteller and her clear-eyed observations of the savagery beneath the well-bred surface of high society. As with <i>The Age of Innocence</i> and <i>Ethan Frome</i>, this novel was also made into a successful motion picture.",

    "description": "Winner of the Books for a Better Life/Suze Orman First Book Award<br /><br />May 1986: Seven-year-old Francis Bok was selling his mother's eggs and peanuts near his village in southern Sudan when Arab raiders on horseback burst into the quiet marketplace, murdering men and gathering the women and young children into a group. Strapped to horses and donkeys, Francis and others were taken north into lives of slavery under wealthy Muslim farmers.<br /><br />For ten years, Francis lived in a shed near the goats and cattle that were his responsibility. After two failed attempts to flee--each bringing severe beatings and death threats--Francis finally escaped at age seventeen. He persevered through prison and refugee camps for three more years, winning the attention of United Nations officials who granted passage to America.<br /><br />Now a student and an antislavery activist, Francis Bok has made it his life mission to combat world slavery. His is the first voice to speak to an estimated 27 million people held against their will in nearly every nation, including our own. <i>Escape from Slavery </i>is at once a riveting adventure, a story of desperation and triumph, and a window revealing a world that few have survived to tell.",

    "description": "Outsider musicians can be the product of damaged DNA, alien abduction, drug fry, demonic possession, or simply sheer obliviousness. This book profiles dozens of outsider musicians, both prominent and obscure\u2014figures such as The Shaggs, Syd Barrett, Tiny Tim, Jandek, Captain Beefheart, Daniel Johnston, Harry Partch, and The Legendary Stardust Cowboy\u2014and presents their strange life stories along with photographs, interviews, cartoons, and discographies. About the only things these self-taught artists have in common are an utter lack of conventional tunefulness and an overabundance of earnestness and passion. But, believe it or not, they\u2019re worth listening to, often outmatching all contenders for inventiveness and originality.<br /><br />A CD featuring songs by artists profiled in the book is also available.<br />",

    "description": "<strong>A startling book full of jaw-dropping insights into the real reasons that young men and women are having a harder time than ever before committing to a relationship</strong> How many times have you or someone you care about wondered: Why am I still single? Is it me, or is it them? <em>Unhooked Generation</em> answers those questions with important discoveries about the unique challenges faced by today's young men and women. It shouldn't be surprising that were still single--it's a miracle when we can make it work. Here are just a few of this generation's stumbling blocks:<br /><br /><strong>The checklist</strong> -- the secret set of requirements that men and women use to measure each prospective date. Is he tall enough/rich enough? Is she pretty enough/flexible enough? Does he/she like sports too much or not enough? Like your dog?<br /><strong>The DTR</strong> -- Have you \"Defined The Relationship\"? Had \"The Talk\"? It's when you ask where the relationship is going--and it strikes fear into most hearts.<br /><strong>Settling</strong> -- When is it compromise and when is it giving in--To this generation, those concepts are often synonymous.<br /><strong>Consumer sex</strong> -- Sex is a powerful commodity, and this generation has separated it from commitment while ignoring the long-term consequences.<br />Based on interviews with one hundred men and women across the country, <em>Unhooked Generation</em> offers a page-turning analysis of what is keeping this generation unhooked--and a sharp, concrete final chapter that explains how we can happily change course.",

    "description": "Intention is generally viewed as a pit-bull kind of determination propelling one to succeed at all costs by never giving up on an inner picture. In this view, an attitude that combines hard work with an indefatigable drive toward excellence is the way to succeed. However, intention is viewed very differently in this book. <b>Dr. Wayne W. Dyer </b>has researched intention as a force in the universe that <i>allows</i> the act of creation to take place. This book explores intention\u2014not as something you do\u2014but as an energy you\u2019re a part of. We\u2019re all <i>intended</i> here through the invisible power of intention. This is the first book to look at intention as a field of energy that you can access to begin co-creating your life with the power of intention.<br />\u00a0<br />Part I deals with the principles of intention, offering true stories and examples on ways to make the connection. Dr. Dyer identifies the attributes of the all-creating universal mind of intention as creative, kind, loving, beautiful, expanding, endlessly abundant, and receptive, explaining the importance of emulating this source of creativity. In Part II, Dr. Dyer offers an intention guide with specific ways to apply the co-creating principles in daily life. Part III is an exhilarating description of Dr. Dyer\u2019s vision of a world in harmony with the universal mind of intention.<br />",

It also takes up contemporary philosophy, theology and political science, colorfully running against the intimidating tide of advanced pluralism that finds natural law so difficult to tolerate.",

A young woman visits her father following his nervous breakdown, and a devoted sister is profoundly unsettled by the sermon her brother insists on reciting. Whether in childhood or Vietnam, in memory or the eternal present, these people are revealed in the extenuating, sometimes extreme circumstances of everyday life, and in the complex consequences of their decisions\u2014that, for instance, can bring together an innocent inner-city youth and a little girl attacked, months earlier, by a dog in a wintry park. Yet each story, however crucial, is marked by Mr. Wolff\u2019s compassionate understanding and humor.<br /><br />In short, fiction of dazzling emotional range and absolute authority.",

Albert Copeland, the head of the family, writes it all down in the notebooks he started once to track the progress of the floatplanes he built, though they never did fly. Everything about the Copelands is in these books. And every one of them has his say. Funny and poignant, a family album of talk and tales, <i>The Floatplane Notebooks</i> shares the best-kept secrets of love, loss, and learning to let go.",

The Jungle Queen exists in the real world as Julie Winters, a freelance social worker who often bails the Maxx out of jail. While the Maxx is aware of the Outback, Julie is not, though it is integral to both of their stories.\n    The spanish edition was published in three larger volumes as <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/71803-the-maxx-absolute\">The Maxx Absolute</a>.",

    "description": "Alphonse, a young Walloon officer, is travelling to join his regiment in Madrid in 1739. But he soon finds himself mysteriously detained at a highway inn in the strange and varied company of thieves, brigands, cabbalists, noblemen, coquettes and gypsies, whose stories he records over sixty-six days. The resulting manuscript is discovered some forty years later in a sealed casket, from which tales of characters transformed through disguise, magic and illusion, of honour and cowardice, of hauntings and seductions, leap forth to create a vibrant polyphony of human voices. Jan Potocki (1761-1812) used a range of literary styles - gothic, picaresque, adventure, pastoral, erotica - in his novel of stories-within-stories, which, like the Decameron and Tales from the Thousand and One Nights, provides entertainment on an epic scale.",

    "description": "\"\"No one in this world, so far as I know, has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people.\" --H. L. Mencken\" <br />H. L. Mencken was wrong. <br />In this endlessly fascinating book, \"New Yorker\" columnist James Surowiecki explores a deceptively simple idea that has profound implications: large groups of people are \"smarter\" than an elite few, no matter how brilliant--better at solving problems, fostering innovation, coming to wise decisions, even predicting the future. <br />This seemingly counterintuitive notion has endless and major ramifications for how businesses operate, how knowledge is advanced, how economies are (or should be) organized and how we live our daily lives. With seemingly boundless erudition and in delightfully clear prose, Surowiecki ranges across fields as diverse as popular culture, psychology, ant biology, economic behaviorism, artificial intelligence, military history and political theory to show just how this principle operates in the real world. <br />Despite the sophistication of his arguments, Surowiecki presents them in a wonderfully entertaining manner. The examples he uses are all down-to-earth, surprising, and fun to ponder. Why is the line in which you're standing always the longest? Why is it that you can buy a screw anywhere in the world and it will fit a bolt bought ten-thousand miles away? Why is network television so awful? If you had to meet someone in Paris on a specific day but had no way of contacting them, when and where would you meet? Why are there traffic jams? What's the best way to win money on a game show? Why, when you walk into a convenience store at 2:00 A.M. to buy a quart of orange juice, is it there waiting for you? What do Hollywood mafia movies have to teach us about why corporations exist? <br />\"The Wisdom of Crowds\" is a brilliant but accessible biography of an idea, one with important lessons for how we live our lives, select our leaders, conduct our business, and think about our world.",

    "description": "Joe Klein, best-selling author of <i>Primary Colors</i> and one of our most brilliant political analysts, now tackles the subject he knows best: Bill Clinton. Astute, even-handed, and keenly intelligent, <i>The Natural</i> is the <i>only</i> book to read if you want to understand exactly what happened\u2013to the military, to the economy, to the American people, to the country\u2013during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, and how the decisions made during his tenure affect all of us today.<br /><br />Much has been written about Clinton, but <i>The Natural</i> is the first work to cut through the gossip, scandals, media hype, and emotional turbulence that Clinton always engendered, to step back and rationally analyze the eight years of his tenure, a period during which America rose to unprecedented levels of prosperity. Joe Klein puts that record into perspective, showing us what worked and what didn\u2019t, exactly what was accomplished and why, and who was responsible for the successes and the failures.<br /><br />We see how the Clinton White House functioned on the inside, how it dealt with the maneuvers of Congress and the Gingrich revolution, and who held power and made the decisions during the endless crises that beset the administration. Klein\u2019s access to the White House over the years as a journalist gave him a prime spot from which to view every crucial event\u2013both political and personal\u2013and he sets them forth in an insightful, readable, and completely engrossing manner. <br /><br /><i>The Natural </i>is stern in its criticism and convincing with its praise. It will cause endless debate amongst friends and foes of the Clinton administration. It is a book that anyone interested in contemporary politics, in American history, or in the functioning of our democracy, should read.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

The four men portrayed here have different relationships to their environment, and they encounter each other on mountain trails, in forests and rapids, sometimes with reserve, sometimes with friendliness, sometimes fighting hard across a philosophical divide.",

Prized as \u201cthe best stone in Britain\u201d by Roman invaders who carved jewelry out of it, coal has transformed societies, expanded frontiers, and sparked social movements, and still powers our electric grid. Yet coal\u2019s world-changing power has come at a tremendous price, including centuries of blackening our skies and lungs\u2014and now the dangerous warming of our global climate. Ranging from the \u201cgreat stinking fogs\u201d of London to the rat-infested coal mines of Pennsylvania, from the impoverished slums of Manchester to the toxic streets of Beijing, <b>Coal</b> is a captivating narrative about an ordinary substance with an extraordinary impact on human civilization.",

    "description": "\u201cWhy has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure? Nothing is secure. And this is the good news. But only if you are not seeking security as the point of your life.\u201d\u2013Eve Ensler<br /><br />When her stage play <i>The Vagina Monologues</i> became a runaway hit and an international sensation, Eve Ensler emerged as a powerful voice and champion for women everywhere. Now the brilliant playwright gives us her first major work written exclusively for the printed page. Insecure at Last is a timely and urgent look at our security-obsessed world, the drastic measures taken to keep us safe, and how we can truly experience freedom by letting go of the deceptive notion of vigilant \u201cprotection.\u201d<br /><br />Ensler draws on personal experiences and candid interviews with burka-clad women in Afghanistan; female prisoners in upstate New York; survivors at the Superdome after Katrina; and anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan\u2013sharing unforgettable snapshots that chronicle a post-9/11 existence in which hyped obsession for safety and security has undermined our humanity. The us-versus-them mentality, Ensler explains, has closed our minds and hardened our compassionate hearts. <br /><br />Provocative, illuminating, inspiring, and boldly envisioned, Insecure at Last challenges us to reconsider what it means to be free, to discover that our strength is not born out of that which protects us. Ensler offers us the opportunity to reevaluate our everyday lives, expose our vulnerability, and, in doing so, experience true freedom and fulfillment.",

    "description": "The Gashlycrumb Tinies: or, After the Outing is an abecedarian book written by Edward Gorey that was first published in 1963. Gorey tells the tale of 26 children (each representing a letter of the alphabet) and their untimely deaths in rhyming dactylic couplets, accompanied by the author's distinctive black and white illustrations. It is one of Edward Gorey's best-known books, and is the most notorious amongst his roughly half-dozen mock alphabets.[2] It has been described as a \"sarcastic rebellion against a view of childhood that is sunny, idyllic, and instructive\". The morbid humor of the book comes in part from the mundane ways in which children die, such as falling down the stairs or choking on a peach. Far from illustrating the dramatic and fantastical childhood nightmares, these scenarios instead poke fun at the banal paranoias that come as a part of parenting.",

Set primarily on Zongo Street, a fictitious community in West Africa, the stories -- which are reminiscent of the works of Ben Okri and Amos Tutuola -- introduce us to wonderfully quirky characters and the most uproarious, poignant, and rawest moments of life. There's Kumi, the enigmatic title character who teaches a young boy to finally ask questions of his traditions. And as Ali moves his characters to America we meet Felix, who struggles with America's love of the exotic in \"Rachmaninov.\"<br /><br /><em>The Prophet of Zongo Street</em> heralds a new voice and showcases Mohammed Naseehu Ali's extraordinary ability to craft stories that are both allegorical and unforgettable.",

    "description": "Ralph Waldo Emerson is one of the most important figures in the history of American thought, religion, and literature. The vitality of his writings and the unsettling power of his example continue to influence us more than a hundred years after his death. Now Robert D. Richardson Jr. brings to life an Emerson very different from the old stereotype of the passionless Sage of Concord. Drawing on a vast amount of new material, including correspondence among the Emerson brothers, Richardson gives us a rewarding intellectual biography that is also a portrait of the whole man.<br /><br />These pages present a young suitor, a grief-stricken widower, an affectionate father, and a man with an abiding genius for friendship. The great spokesman for individualism and self-reliance turns out to have been a good neighbor, an activist citizen, a loyal brother. Here is an Emerson who knew how to laugh, who was self-doubting as well as self-reliant, and who became the greatest intellectual adventurer of his age.<br /><br />Richardson has, as much as possible, let Emerson speak for himself through his published works, his many journals and notebooks, his letters, his reported conversations. This is not merely a study of Emerson's writing and his influence on others; it is Emerson's life as he experienced it. We see the failed minister, the struggling writer, the political reformer, the poetic liberator.<br /><br />The Emerson of this book not only influenced Thoreau, Fuller, Whitman, Dickinson, and Frost, he also inspired Nietzsche, William James, Baudelaire, Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, and Jorge Luis Borges. Emerson's timeliness is persistent and striking: his insistence that literature and science are not separate cultures, his emphasis on the worth of every individual, his respect for nature.<br /><br />Richardson gives careful attention to the enormous range of Emerson's readings\u2014from Persian poets to George Sand\u2014and to his many friendships and personal encounters\u2014from Mary Moody Emerson to the Cherokee chiefs in Boston\u2014evoking both the man and the times in which he lived. Throughout this book, Emerson's unquenchable vitality reaches across the decades, and his hold on us endures.",

She's got an abusive ex-husband who's into making tasteless threats, a rash of mounting bills that are taking a huge bite out of her budget, and two enticing men knocking on her door.<br /><br /><b>The Dish</b><br /><br />Now determined to take control of her life, Goldy moves her business and her son to ritzy Aspen Meadow Country Club, where she accepts a job as a live-in cook. But just as she's beginning to think she's got it made--catering decadent dinners and posh society picnics and enjoying the favors of Philip Miller, a handsome local shrink, and Tom Shulz, her more-than-friendly neighborhood cop--the dishy doctor inexplicably drives his BMW into an oncoming bus.<br /><br /><br /><b>The Unsavory Killer</b><br /><br />Convinced that Philip's bizarre death was no accident, Goldy decides to do a little investigating of her own. But sifting through the unpalatable secrets of the dead doc's life will toss her into a case seasoned with unexpected danger and even more unexpected revelations--the kind that could get a caterer and the son she loves. . .killed.",

    "description": "When it first appeared in 1991, Eric Lax's splendid biography, written with nineteen years of access to Woody Allen, was universally hailed as the definitive portrait of a film genius. The next year, as Allen's long relationship with Mia Farrow disintegrated amid scandal, a new phase of his life and work began. For this edition, Lax has written a chapter on the breakup and the personal and professional changes that followed. He chronicles Allen's next eight films, from <i>Shadows and Fog</i> to <i>Small Time Crooks</i>, and again offers Woody's candid opinions of his art and himself. Published to coincide with Allen's sixty-fifth birthday, this updated biography will continue to be \"required reading for Woodyphiles\" (<i>Kansas City Star</i>).",

    "description": "Former pop star Heather Wells has settled nicely into her new life as assistant dorm director at New York College\u2014a career that does <em>not</em> require her to drape her size 12 body in embarrassingly skimpy outfits. She can even cope (sort of) with her rocker ex-boyfriend's upcoming nuptials, which the press has dubbed <em>The</em> Celebrity Wedding of the Decade. But she's definitely having a hard time dealing with the situation in the dormitory kitchen\u2014where a cheerleader has lost her head on the first day of the semester. (Actually, her head is accounted for\u2014it's her torso that's AWOL.)<br /><br />Surrounded by hysterical students\u2014with her ex-con father on her doorstep and her ex-love bombarding her with unwanted phone calls\u2014Heather welcomes the opportunity to play detective . . . again. If it gets her mind off her personal problems\u2014and teams her up again with the gorgeous P.I. who owns the brownstone where she lives\u2014it's all good. But the murder trail is leading the average-sized amateur investigator into a shadowy world. And if she doesn't watch her step, Heather will soon be singing her swan song!",

    "description": "Five hundred miles north of Vancouver is Kitamaat, an Indian reservation in the homeland of the Haisla people. Growing up a tough, wild tomboy, swimming, fighting, and fishing in a remote village where the land slips into the green ocean on the edge of the world, Lisamarie has always been different. <br /><br />Visited by ghosts and shapeshifters, tormented by premonitions, she can't escape the sense that something terrible is waiting for her. She recounts her enchanted yet scarred life as she journeys in her speedboat up the frigid waters of the Douglas Channel. She is searching for her brother, dead by drowning, and in her own way running as fast as she can toward danger. Circling her brother's tragic death are the remarkable characters that make up her family: Lisamarie's parents, struggling to join their Haisla heritage with Western ways; Uncle Mick, a Native rights activist and devoted Elvis fan; and the headstrong Ma-ma-oo (Haisla for \"grandmother\"), a guardian of tradition. <br /><br />Haunting, funny, and vividly poignant, <i>Monkey Beach</i> gives full scope to Robinson's startling ability to make bedfellows of comedy and the dark underside of life. Informed as much by its lush living wilderness as by the humanity of its colorful characters, <i>Monkey Beach</i> is a profoundly moving story about childhood and the pain of growing older--a multilayered tale of family grief and redemption.",

Einstein, therefore, is great in the public eye partly because he has made revolutionary discoveries which cannot be translated into the common tongue.

Sent to the front lines, Perry and his platoon come face-to-face with the Vietcong and the real horror of warfare. But violence and death aren't the only hardships. As Perry struggles to find virtue in himself and his comrades, he questions why black troops are given the most dangerous assignments, and why the U.S. is there at all.",

    "description": "<b>\"Oh, screw it, let's do it.\"</b><br /><br />That's the philosophy that has allowed Richard Branson, in slightly more than twenty-five years, to spawn so many successful ventures. From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways), to music (Virgin Records and V2), to cola (Virgin Cola), to retail (Virgin Megastores), and nearly a hundred others, ranging from financial services to bridal wear, Branson has a track record second to none.<br /><br />Losing My Virginity is the unusual, frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the great business geniuses of our time. When Richard Branson started his first business, he and his friends decided that \"since we're complete virgins at business, let's call it just that: Virgin.\" Since then, Branson has written his own \"rules\" for success, creating a group of companies with a global presence, but no central headquarters, no management hierarchy, and minimal bureaucracy.<br /><br />Many of Richard Branson's companies--airlines, retailing, and cola are good examples--were started in the face of entrenched competition. The experts said, \"Don't do it.\" But Branson found golden opportunities in markets in which customers have been ripped off or underserved, where confusion reigns, and the competition is complacent. <br />And in this stressed-out, overworked age, Richard Branson gives us a new model: a dynamic, hardworking, successful entrepreneur who lives life to the fullest. Family, friends, fun, and adventure are equally important as business in Branson's life. Losing My Virginity is a portrait of a productive, sane, balanced life, filled with rich and colorful stories:<br /><br /> Crash-landing his hot-air balloon in the Algerian desert, yet remaining determined to have another go at being the first to circle the globe<br /><br />Signing the Sex Pistols, Janet Jackson, the Rolling Stones, Boy George, and Phil Collins<br /><br />Fighting back when British Airways took on Virgin Atlantic and successfully suing this pillar of the British business establishment<br /><br />Swimming two miles to safety during a violent storm off the coast of Mexico<br /><br />Selling Virgin Records to save Virgin Atlantic<br /><br />Staging a rescue flight into Baghdad before the start of the Gulf War . . .<br /><br />And much more. Losing My Virginity is the ultimate tale of personal and business survival from a man who combines the business prowess of Bill Gates and the promotional instincts of P. T. Barnum.",

    "description": "The world's most popular delinquent reveals all in this guide to the hard knock facts of life, out now in paperback. Written and illustrated by Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons, Bart Simpson's Guide to Life is chock full of the kind of humour that keeps Simpsons devotees hooked to the show. Including such gems as Dr Bart's Miracle Cures, Homer's Dozen-Donut-A-Day Diet and the beauty secrets of Marge ('Never pluck protruding nose hair, death may result. Instead, use a lightweight Weedwacker') and Homer ('The scent of chili dogs, onions and beer, when eaten in combination, makes women swoon'). With guest appearances by all the great Simpsons characters, including Lisa, Moe, Barney, Millhouse, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mr Burns and Smithers. Like the shows themselves, Bart Simpson's Guide to Life has something to please all age groups and is so crammed full of fun that you'll spot something new every time you read it.",

Humans had discovered this artificial spaceport, full of working interstellar ships left behind by the mysterious, vanished Heechee. Their destinations are preprogrammed. They are easy to operate, but impossible to control. Some came back with discoveries which made their intrepid pilots rich; others returned with their remains barely identifiable. It was the ultimate game of Russian roulette, but in this resource-starved future there was no shortage of desperate volunteers.",

The sisters put aside their differences, and embark on a spirited campaign to save him from boil-in-the-bag dinners, slovenly housekeeping, and such extravagant purchases as a broken-down Rolls-Royce. In the midst of these machinations\u2014which include long-winded letters to solicitors, venomous gossip, and all-out spying\u2014Lewycka stealthily reveals how the depredations of the past century dictate what a family can bear.\"<br />Copyright \u00a9 2005 The New Yorker",

    "description": "One of the most popular and acclaimed Latin American authors of our century presents this unforgettable memoir, an exquisitely rendered, deeply moving mother-daughter story that doubles as her autobiography. \"Paula\" is a soul-baring memoir one reads without drawing a breath, like a novel of suspense. The point of departure for these moving pages is a tragic personal experience. In December 1991, Isabel Allende's daughter, Paula, became gravely ill and shortly thereafter fell into a coma. During hours in the hospital, the author began to write the story of her family for her unconscious daughter. In the telling, bizarre ancestors appear before our eyes, and we hear both delightful and bitter childhood memories, amazing anecdotes of youthful years, the most intimate secrets passed along in whispers. Chile, Allende's native land, comes alive as well, with the turbulent history of the military coup of 1973, the following dictatorship and her family's years of exile.<br /><br />As an exorcism of death, in these pages Isabel Allende explores the past and questions the gods. The result is a magical book that carries the reader from tears to laughter, from terror to sensuality and wisdom. \"Paula\" is a prodigious evocation and a hymn to life, written from the heart of the courageous and estimable woman who created \"The House of the Spirits.\"",

    "description": "Like many an exclusive club, the medical profession subjects its prospective members to rigorous indoctrination: medical students are overloaded with work, deprived of sleep and normal human contact, drilled and tested and scheduled down to the last minute. Difficult as the regimen may be, for those who don't fit the traditional mold\u2014white, male, middle-to-upper class, and heterosexual\u2014medical school can be that much more harrowing. This riveting book tells the tales of a new generation of medical students\u2014students whose varied backgrounds are far from traditional. Their stories will forever alter the way we see tomorrow's doctors. <br /><br />In these pages, a black teenage mother overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds, an observant Muslim dons the hijab during training, an alcoholic hides her addiction. We hear the stories of an Asian refugee, a Mexican immigrant, a closeted Christian, an oversized woman\u2014these once unlikely students are among those who describe their medical school experiences with uncommon candor, giving a close-up look at the inflexible curriculum, the pervasive competitive culture, and the daunting obstacles that come with being \"different\" in medical school. Their tales of courage are by turns poignant, amusing, eye-opening\u2014and altogether unforgettable.",

    "description": "In the bizarre world of Franz Kafka, salesmen turn into giant bugs, apes give lectures at college academies, and nightmares probe the mysteries of modern humanity\u2019s unhappiness. More than any other modern writer in world literature, Kafka captures the loneliness and misery that fill the lives of 20th-century humanity. The Metamorphosis and Other Stories reveals the author\u2019s extraordinary talent in a variety of forms\u2014prose poems, short stories, sketches, allegories, and novelettes\u2014and showcases the straight\u2013faced humor, startling psychological insight, and haunting imagination for which he is revered as a modern master. In this brilliant new translation, prize\u2013winning translator Joachim Neugroschel preserves the delicate balance, rich timbre, and wondrous language of Kafka\u2019s original works. In addition to \"The Metamorphosis\", this collection includes \"Early Stories\", \"Contemplation\", \"The Judgement\", \"The Stoker\", \"In the Penal Colony\", and \"A Country Doctor\".",

When she was twenty-six years old, she ventured into the forests of Africa to observe chimpanzees in the wild. On her expeditions she braved the dangers with leopards and lions in the African bush. And she got to know an amazing group of wild chimpanzees -- intelligent animals whose lives, in work and play and family relationships, bear a surprising resemblance to our own.",

    "description": "Originally published in 1994 to critical acclaim, Singing Songs still resonates as a profound statement about the secrets families keep from the rest of the world, as Anna, the resilient young narrator, journeys through childhood trapped in a fragmented family caught in a cycle of abuse, denial, and neglect. This new edition includes a foreword by the author, reflecting on how Singing Songs came to be written.",

    "description": "With only a yellowing photograph in hand, a young man - also named Jonathan Safran Foer - sets out to find the woman who might or might not have saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Accompanied by an old man haunted by memories of the war, an amorous dog named Sammy Davis, Junior, Junior, and the unforgettable Alex, a young Ukrainian translator who speaks in a sublimely butchered English, Jonathan is led on a quixotic journey over a devastated landscape and into an unexpected past.<br /> As their adventure unfolds, Jonathan imagines the history of his grandfather's village, conjuring a magical fable of startling symmetries that unite generations across time. Lit by passion, fear, guilt, memory, and hope, the characters in Everything Is Illuminated mine the black holes of history. As the search moves back in time, the fantastical history moves forward, until reality collides with fiction in a heart-stopping scene of extraordinary power.<br /> An arresting blend of high comedy and great tragedy, this is a story about searching for people and places that no longer exist, for the hidden truths that haunt every family, and for the delicate but necessary tales that link past and future. Exuberant and wise, hysterically funny and deeply moving, EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED is an astonishing debut.",

    "description": "A masterpiece of satire, this classic has entertained and enlightened readers the world over with its sly and ironic portrayal of human life from the vantage point of Screwtape, a senior tempter in the service of \"Our Father Below.\" At once wildly comic, deadly serious, and strikingly original, C. S. Lewis gives us the correspondence of the worldly-wise old devil to his nephew Wormwood, a novice demon in charge of securing the damnation of an ordinary young man. <em>The Screwtape Letters</em> is the most engaging and humorous account of temptation\u2014and triumph over it\u2014ever written.<br /><br />Now, for the first time, <em>The Screwtape Letters</em> is presented with its full text alongside helpful annotations provided by Lewis enthusiast and dramatist Paul McCusker. The notes include literary, theological, and biographical information to enhance Lewis's core themes and demystify complex ideas. McCusker also guides readers to concepts and references from the beloved author's other treasured volumes to deepen and enrich this timeless classic. The annotated edition is the ultimate guide for understanding the heavenly truths buried in these epistles from below.",

Her father, the son of missionaries, leads a charmed and secretive life, though his greatest joy is sharing his beloved city with his only daughter. Yet when Anna and her mother flee Japanese-occupied Shanghai to return to California, he stays behind, believing his connections and a little bit of luck will keep him safe.<br /><br />Through Anna's memories and her father's journals we learn of his fall from charismatic millionaire to tortured prisoner, in a story of betrayal and reconciliation that spans two continents. <i>The Distant Land of My Father</i>, a breathtaking and richly lyrical debut, unfolds to reveal an enduring family love through tragic circumstances.",

    "description": "<i>\n  <b>'He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp... his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alter'</b>\n</i><br /><br />Published as a 'shilling shocker', Robert Louis Stevenson's dark psychological fantasy gave birth to the idea of the split personality. The story of respectable Dr Jekyll's strange association with 'damnable young man' Edward Hyde; the hunt through fog-bound London for a killer; and the final revelation of Hyde's true identity is a chilling exploration of humanity's basest capacity for evil. The other stories in this volume also testify to Stevenson's inventiveness within the Gothic tradition: \"Olalla', a tale of vampirism and tainted family blood, and 'The Body Snatcher', a gruesome fictionalisation of the exploits of the notorious Burke and Hare.<br /><br />This edition contains a critical introduction by Robert Mighall, which discusses class, criminality and the significance of the story's London setting. It also includes an essay on the scientific contexts of the novel and the development of the idea of the Jekyll-and-Hyde personality.",

    "description": "For Julia Scheeres and her adopted brother David, \"Jesus Land\" stretched from their parents' fundamentalist home, past the hostilities of high school, and deep into a Christian reform school in the Dominican Republic. For these two teenagers - brother and sister, black and white - the 1980s were a trial by fire.<br /><br />In this memoir, Scheeres takes us from the familiar Midwest, a land of cottonwood trees and trailer parks, to a place beyond her imagining. At home, the Scheeres kids must endure the usual trials of adolescence - high-school hormones, incessant bullying, and the deep-seated restlessness of social misfits everywhere - under the shadow of virulent racism neither knows how to contend with. When they start to crack (or fight back), they are packed off to Escuela Caribe. This brutal, prison-like \"Christian boot camp\" demands that its inhabitants repent for their sins - sins that few of them are aware of having committed. Julia and David's determination to make it though with heart and soul intact is told here with immediacy, candor, sparkling humor, and not an ounce of malice. Jesus Land is, on every page, a keenly moving ode to the sustaining power of love, and rebellion, and the dream of a perfect family.",

    "description": "J.R. Ackerley's German shepherd Tulip was skittish, possessive, and wild, but he loved her deeply. This clear-eyed and wondering, humorous and moving book, described by Christopher Isherwood as one of the \"greatest masterpieces of animal literature,\" is her biography, a work of faultless and respectful observation that transcends the seeming modesty of its subject. In telling the story of his beloved Tulip, Ackerley has written a book that is a profound and subtle meditation on the strangeness abiding at the heart of all relationships.",

    "description": "A #1 bestseller in Europe, CHILD OF THE JUNGLE tells the remarkable story of a childhood and adolescence spent caught between two modes of existence-jungle life and Western \"civilization.\" <br /> Sabine Kuegler was five years old when her family-her German linguist-missionary parents and her siblings-moved to the territory of the recently discovered hunter-and-gatherer Fayu tribe of Papua New Guinea. The Fayu tribe is best known for being a Stone Age community untouched by modern times-they live an existence characterized by fear, violence, and atavistic ritual (including cannibalism in some regions)-but Sabine's family saw another side to them as well. Once the Kueglers were accepted by a clan chief, they found themselves becoming a part of a tightly knit and fiercely loyal community, and living the primal existence of the Fayu-one marked by the natural cycles of day and night, malaria and other diseases, and daily encounters with wildlife, from swims with crocodiles to dinners of worms.<br /> As the Kueglers changed, so did the Fayu people, learning from Sabine's family that there was a way out of their cycle of violence and that forgiveness can be sweeter than revenge. <br /> At the age of 17, Sabine found her life turned upside down when she left for Switzerland to attend boarding school and entered traditional society head-on. CHILD OF THE JUNGLE is the story of a life lived among the Fayu and the author's attempt to reconcile her feelings about \"civilization\" with those about a life she knew and loved. <br />",

    "description": "Helen DeWitt's extraordinary debut, <em>The Last Samurai</em>, centers on the relationship between Sibylla, a single mother of precocious and rigorous intelligence, and her son, who, owing to his mother's singular attitude to education, develops into a prodigy of learning. Ludo reads Homer in the original Greek at 4 before moving on to Hebrew, Japanese, Old Norse, and Inuit; studying advanced mathematical techniques (Fourier analysis and Laplace transformations); and, as the title hints, endlessly watching and analyzing Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, <em>The Seven Samurai</em>. But the one question that eludes an answer is that of the name of his father: Sibylla believes the film obliquely provides the male role models that Ludo's genetic father cannot, and refuses to be drawn on the question of paternal identity. The child thinks differently, however, and eventually sets out on a search, one that leads him beyond the certainties of acquired knowledge into the complex and messy world of adults.The novel draws on themes topical and perennial--the hothousing of children, the familiar literary trope of the quest for the (absent) father--and as such, divides itself into two halves: the first describes Ludo's education, the second follows him in his search for his father and father figures. The first stresses a sacred, Apollonian pursuit of logic, precise (if wayward) erudition, and the erratic and endlessly fascinating architecture of languages, while the second moves this knowledge into the world of emotion, human ambitions, and their attendant frustrations and failures.<br /><br /><em>The Last Samurai</em> is about the pleasure of ideas, the rich varieties of human thought, the possibilities that life offers us, and, ultimately, the balance between the structures we make of the world and the chaos that it proffers in return. Stylistically, the novel mirrors this ambivalence: DeWitt's remarkable prose follows the shifts and breaks of human consciousness and memory, capturing the intrusions of unspoken thought that punctuate conversation while providing tantalizing disquisitions on, for example, Japanese grammar or the physics of aerodynamics. It is remarkable, profound, and often very funny. Arigato DeWitt-sensei. <em>--Burhan Tufail</em>",

    "description": "In <i>Seeing in the Dark</i>, a poetic love letter to science and to the skies, Timothy Ferris invites us all to become stargazers. He recounts his own experiences as an enthralled lifelong amateur astronomer and reports from around the globe -- from England and Italy to the Florida Keys and the Chilean Andes -- on the revolution that's putting millions in touch with the night sky. In addition, Ferris offers an authoritative and engaging report on what's out there to be seen -- what Saturn, the Ring nebula, the Silver Coin galaxy, and the Virgo supercluster really are and how to find them. The appendix includes star charts, observing lists, and a guide on how to get involved in astronomy. <br /> Ferris takes us inside a major revolution sweeping astronomy, as lone amateur astronomers, in global networks linked by the Internet, make important discoveries that are the envy of the professionals. His ability to describe the wonders of the universe is simply magical, and his enthusiasm for his subject is irresistible.",

The author suggests that natural vision depends on the eyes in the head on a body supported by the ground, the brain being only the central organ of a complete visual system. When no constraints are put on the visual system, people look around, walk up to something interesting and move around it so as to see it from all sides, and go from one vista to another. That is natural vision -- and what this book is about.<br />",

    "description": "The events of the horrific Halifax explosion are well documented: on December 6, 1917, the French munitions ship <em>Mont Blanc </em>and the Belgian relief ship <em>Imo </em>collide in the Halifax harbour. Nearly 2,000 people are killed; over 9,000 more are injured. The story of one of the world\u2019s worst non-natural disasters has been told before, but never like this.<br /><br />In a sweeping narrative, <em>Curse of the Narrows </em>tells a tale of ordinary people in an extraordinary situation, retracing the steps of survivors through the wreckage of a city destroyed. Laura M. MacDonald weaves a panoramic chronicle of the astonishing international response to the explosion, telling of the generous donations of money and medical specialists made by the city of Boston, of how the number of horrific injuries to Halifax\u2019s children inspired startling developments in pediatric medicine, and exploring the disaster\u2019s chilling link to the creation of the atomic bomb.<br /><br />Filled with archival photos, defined by meticulous research andi nfused with a storyteller\u2019s sensibility, <em>Curse of the Narrows </em>is a compelling and powerful book.",

    "description": "Amy Hempel's compassion, intensity, and illuminating observations have made her one of the most distinctive and admired modern writers. In three stunning books of stories, she has established a voice as unique and recognizable as the photographs of Cindy Sherman or the brushstrokes of Robert Motherwell. <i>The Dog of the Marriage,</i> Hempel's fourth collection, is about sexual obsession, relationships gone awry, and the unsatisfied longings of everyday life. <p> In \"Offertory,\" a modern-day Scheherazade entertains and manipulates her lover with stories of her sexual encounters with a married couple as a very young woman. In \"Reference # 388475848-5,\" a letter contesting a parking ticket becomes a beautiful and unnerving statement of faith. In \"Jesus Is Waiting,\" a woman driving to New York sends a series of cryptically honest postcards to an old lover. And the title story is a heartbreaking tale about the objects and animals and unmired desires that are left behind after death or divorce. </p><p> These nine stories teem with wisdom, emotion, and surprising wit. Hempel explores the intricate psychology of people falling in and out of love, trying to locate something or someone elusive or lost. Her sentences are as lean, original, and startling as any in contemporary fiction.</p>",

Tracking their progress -- and inevitable lapses -- Levine contemplates need and desire, scarcity and security, consumerism and citizenship. She asks the Big Questions: Can the economy survive without shopping? Are Q-tips necessary?<br /><br /><i>Not Buying It</i> is the confession of a woman any reader can identify with: someone who can't live without French roast coffee or SmartWool socks but who has had it up to here with overconsumption and its effects on the earth and everyone who dwells there.<br /><br />For the humor and intelligence of its insights, the refreshment of its skepticism, and the surprises of its conclusions, <i>Not Buying It</i> is sure to be on anyone's list of Necessities.",

The story of young Helena, daughter of the circus, comes vividly alive as we accompany her on her remarkable mission to a place far beyond wonder; a phantasmagorical quest to rescue a realm from the devouring forces of chaos and shadow in order to win back her stolen \"real\" life from a runaway interloper from the other side.<br /><br />Containing the full screenplay and more than 1,700 illustrated storyboards of the major motion picture -- as well as movie stills, comments, appreciations, and memories from the authors and filmmakers -- this one-of-a-kind volume is destined to become a classic, a keepsake to be cherished by fans of all ages.<br /><br />For all who believe in the glorious reality of dreams, for everyone who longs to ride their imagination to miraculous places, the door is now open wide. See the world anew through the MirrorMask ... and nothing will ever look the same again.",

When they meet at a fair, Alison invites Colette at once to join her on the road as her personal assistant and companion. Troubles spiral out of control when the pair moves to a suburban wasteland in what was once the English countryside. It is not long before the place beyond black threatens to uproot their lives forever. This is Hilary Mantel at her finest--insightful, darkly comic, unorthodox, and thrilling to read.",

    "description": "Frightening, heartbreaking, and exquisitely calibrated, John le Carre's new novel opens with the gruesome murder of the young and beautiful Tessa Quayle near northern Kenya's Lake Turkana, the birthplace of mankind. Her putative African lover and traveling companion, a doctor with one of the aid agencies, has vanished from the scene of the crime. Tessa's much older husband, Justin, a career diplomat at the British High Commission in Nairobi, sets out on a personal odyssey in pursuit of the killers and their motive. A master chronicler of the deceptions and betrayals of ordinary people caught in political conflict, le Carre portrays, in \"The Constant Gardener,\" the dark side of unbridled capitalism. His eighteenth novel is also the profoundly moving story of a man whom tragedy elevates. Justin Quayle, amateur gardener and ineffectual bureaucrat, seemingly oblivious to his wife's cause, discovers his own resources and the extraordinary courage of the woman he barely had time to love.<br /><br />\"The Constant Gardener\" is a magnificent exploration of the new world order by one of the most compelling and elegant storytellers of our time.",

She is rescued from this nightmare by a gaunt stranger who offers her the protection of his house. Given this respite from the bleakness of an existence where she has no home and family, June encounters a series of events that take her to a house in the West Country, where war only occasionally intrudes, where she may find peace, and no longer just be part of the furniture.",

    "description": "These three plays are set in a town in Galway so blighted by rancor, ignorance, and spite that, as the local priest complains, God Himself seems to have no jurisdiction there.<br /> \"The Beauty Queen of Leenane\" portrays ancient, manipulative Mag and her virginal daughter, Maureen, whose mutual loathing may be more durable than any love. In \"A Skull in Connnemara\", Mick Dowd is hired to dig up the bones in the town churchyard, some of which belong to his late and oddly unlamented wife. And the brothers of \"The Lonesome West\" have no sooner buried their father than they are resuming the vicious and utterly trivial quarrel that has been the chief activity of their lives.<br />\"[McDonagh is] the most wickedly funny, brilliantly abrasive young dramatist on either side of the Irish Sea.... He is a born storyteller\".-- \"New York Times\"",

    "description": "<b>'Brilliant and epoch-making.' </b><i>\n  <b>Times Literary Supplement</b>\n</i><br /><br /><i>The Classical Style </i>is an established classic which has remained in print since its first publication in 1971. With his experience as a world-class pianist as well as as teacher at Harvard and Oxford, Charles Rosen produced the definitive survey of the language of the music of the classical period. In the book, Rosen concentrates on the three major figures of the time - Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven - because 'it is in terms of their achievements that the musical vernacular can best be defined'.<br /><br />In this expanded edition, Rosen follows the development of each composer's best known genres: for Haydn, the symphony and string quartet; for Mozart, the concerto, string quintet and comic opera; for Beethoven, the piano sonata. In addition, the author ranges widely through the material of classical music which falls outside these categories.<br /><br />'The word \"masterpiece\" should be used rarely if at all. But it applies to <i>The Classical Style </i>. . . this book sets new standards for the application of language to music.' George Steiner",

    "description": "<em>Persuasion</em>, by <strong>Jane Austen</strong>, is part of the <em>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</em> series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of <em>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</em>:<br /> <br /> New introductions commissioned from today's top writers and scholars <br />Biographies of the authors  \n  <br /> Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events <br />Footnotes and endnotes  \n  <br /> Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work  \n  <br /> Comments by other famous authors  \n  <br /> Study questions to challenge the reader's viewpoints and expectations  \n  <br /> Bibliographies for further reading  \n  <br /> Indices &amp; Glossaries, when appropriate \n  <br /> <br />All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes &amp; Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.<br /><br />In her final novel, as in her earlier ones, <strong>Jane Austen</strong> uses a love story to explore and gently satirize social pretensions and emotional confusion. Persuasion follows the romance of Anne Elliot and naval officer Frederick Wentworth. They were happily engaged until Anne\u2019s friend, Lady Russell, persuaded her that Frederick was \u201cunworthy.\u201d Now, eight years later, Frederick returns, a wealthy captain in the navy, while Anne\u2019s family teeters on the edge of bankruptcy. They still love each other, but their past mistakes threaten to keep them apart.<br />Austen may seem to paint on a small canvas, but her characters contain the full range of human passion and moral complexity, and the author\u2019s generous spirit renders them all with understanding, compassion, and humor.<br /><br /><strong>Susan Ostrov Weisser</strong> is a professor of English at Adelphi University, where she specializes in nineteenth-century literature and women\u2019s studies. Weisser also wrote the introduction to the Barnes &amp; Noble Classics edition of Jane Eyre.",

In doing so, she leaves behind a sparkling social life and successful career to continue the tale of a family and a place which her father, Nicholas Gage, made famous over twenty years ago with his international bestseller, <i>Eleni</i>. Along the way she survives humorous misadventures, absorbs fascinating folklore, and comes to understand that memories of the dead can bring new life to the present. Part travel memoir and part family saga, <i>North of Ithaka</i> is, above all, a journey home.",

Haunted by his father\u2019s own death at the hands of militants, which he fled just before witnessing, Agu is vulnerable to the dangerous yet paternal nature of his new commander.<br /><br />While the war rages on, Agu becomes increasingly divorced from the life he had known before the conflict started\u2014a life of school friends, church services, and time with his family, still intact. As he vividly recalls these sunnier times, his daily reality continues to spin further downward into inexplicable brutality, primal fear, and loss of selfhood. In a powerful, strikingly original voice, Uzodinma Iweala leads the reader through the random travels, betrayals, and violence that mark Agu\u2019s new community. Electrifying and engrossing,\u00a0<em>Beasts of No Nation</em>\u00a0announces the arrival of an extraordinary new writer.",

    "description": "Irish author and playwright Sebastian Barry has created a powerful new novel about divided loyalties and the realities of war.In 1914, Willie Dunne, barely eighteen years old, leaves behind Dublin, his family, and the girl he plans to marry in order to enlist in the Allied forces and face the Germans on the Western Front. Once there, he encounters a horror of violence and gore he could not have imagined and sustains his spirit with only the words on the pages from home and the camaraderie of the mud-covered Irish boys who fight and die by his side.\u00a0 Dimly aware of the political tensions that have grown in Ireland in his absence, Willie returns on leave to find a world split and ravaged by forces closer to home. Despite the comfort he finds with his family, he knows he must rejoin his regiment and fight until the end. With grace and power, Sebastian Barry vividly renders Willie\u2019s personal struggle as well as the overwhelming consequences of war.",

Coetzee has once again crafted an unusual and deeply affecting tale. Told through an ingenious series of formal addresses, <i>Elizabeth Costello</i> is, on the surface, the story of a woman's life as a mother, sister, lover, and writer. Yet it is also a profound and haunting meditation on the nature of storytelling.",

When a mysterious, charismatic stranger trudges into their snowy village with a frighteningly outlandish story to tell, its balance is shaken to the core.",

Engaged as a drawing master to the beautiful Laura Fairlie, Walter is drawn into the sinister intrigues of Sir Percival Glyde and his 'charming' friend Count Fosco, who has a taste for white mice, vanilla bonbons and poison. Pursuing questions of identity and insanity along the paths and corridors of English country houses and the madhouse, <i>The Woman in White</i> is the first and most influential of the Victorian genre that combined Gothic horror with psychological realism.",

Changing social and environmental conditions around the world have fostered the spread of new and potentially devastating viruses and diseases\u2014HIV, Lassa, Ebola, and others. Laurie Garrett takes you on a fifty-year journey through the world's battles with microbes and examines the worldwide conditions that have culminated in recurrent outbreaks of newly discovered diseases, epidemics of diseases migrating to new areas, and mutated old diseases that are no longer curable. She argues that it is not too late to take action to prevent the further onslaught of viruses and microbes, and offers possible solutions for a healthier future.",

His <em>Annotated Alice</em>, first published in 1959, has over half a million copies in print around the world and is beloved by both families and scholars\u2014for it was Gardner who first decoded many of the mathematical riddles and wordplay that lay ingeniously embedded in Carroll's two classic stories, <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em> and <em>Through the Looking Glass</em>.<br /><br />Forty years after this groundbreaking publication, Norton is proud to publish the Definitive Edition of <em>The Annotated Alice</em>, a work that combines the notes of Gardner's 1959 edition with his 1990 volume, <em>More Annotated Alice</em>, as well as additional discoveries drawn from Gardner's encyclopedic knowledge of the texts. Illustrated with John Tenniel's classic, beloved art\u2014along with many recently discovered Tenniel pencil sketches\u2014<em>The Annotated Alice</em> will be Gardner's most beautiful and enduring tribute to Carroll's masterpieces yet.",

    "description": "Must we fight terrorism with terror, match assassination with assassination, and torture with torture? Must we sacrifice civil liberty to protect public safety?<br /><br /><br /> In the age of terrorism, the temptations of ruthlessness can be overwhelming. But we are pulled in the other direction too by the anxiety that a violent response to violence makes us morally indistinguishable from our enemies. There is perhaps no greater political challenge today than trying to win the war against terror without losing our democratic souls. Michael Ignatieff confronts this challenge head-on, with the combination of hard-headed idealism, historical sensitivity, and political judgment that has made him one of the most influential voices in international affairs today.<br /><br /><br /> Ignatieff argues that we must not shrink from the use of violence--that far from undermining liberal democracy, force can be necessary for its survival. But its use must be measured, not a program of torture and revenge. And we must not fool ourselves that whatever we do in the name of freedom and democracy is good. We may need to kill to fight the greater evil of terrorism, but we must never pretend that doing so is anything better than a lesser evil.<br /><br /><br /> In making this case, Ignatieff traces the modern history of terrorism and counter-terrorism, from the nihilists of Czarist Russia and the militias of Weimar Germany to the IRA and the unprecedented menace of Al Qaeda, with its suicidal agents bent on mass destruction. He shows how the most potent response to terror has been force, decisive and direct, but--just as important--restrained. The public scrutiny and political ethics that motivate restraint also give democracy its strongest weapon: the moral power to endure when the furies of vengeance and hatred are spent.<br /><br /><br /> The book is based on the Gifford Lectures delivered at the University of Edinburgh in 2003.",

    "description": "In this sequel to the top-selling <i>A Girl Named Zippy,</i> the woman rising heroically from the couch is Zippy's mother, Delonda. After years of languorous existence, this oversized couch potato emerged from the den to pursue a higher education. Delonda was well read but in other ways seemed ill suited for college: This middle-aged, 260-pound coed had a husband who disapproved of the entire venture, no driver's license, and almost no money. Like its predecessor, <i>She Got Up Off the Couch</i> holds our attention with its sympathetic rendering of idiosyncratic family characters. Hilarious; heartbreaking; ultimately empowering.",

Frustrated by her inability to care for so many, Cassie finds in the local pool hall an oasis of green felt where she can master objects and restrain her emotions. <br /><br />As Cassie grows up, she takes on the thankless role of family provider by working odd jobs and hustling pool. All the while she keeps her eye on the ultimate prize: wringing suitable justice from past wrongs and freeing herself from her life's inertia. <br /><br />In this uplifting story, Haven Kimmel reaches deep into the hamstrung souls of her fictional corner of Indiana to create an astonishing work of pure heartbreak.",

    "description": "Few novels have had as profound an impact as On the Road, and Kerouac's vision continues to inspire: three generations of writers, musicians, artists, and poets cite their discovery of On the Road as the event that \"set them free.\" On the Road chronicles Kerouac's years traveling the North American continent, from East Coast to West Coast to Mexico, with his friend Neal Cassady, \"a sideburned hero of the snowy West.\" As \"Sal Paradise\" and \"Dean Moriarty, \" the two roam the country in a quest for self-knowledge and experience. Kerouac's love of America, his compassion for humanity, and his sense of language as jazz combine to make On the Road an inspirational work of lasting importance.",

Harvard-educated and an aspiring aesthete, Patch is waiting for his inheritance upon his grandfather's death. His reckless marriage to Gloria is fueled by alcohol and destroyed by greed. The Patches race through a series of alcohol-induced fiascoes - first in hilarity, then in despair. <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>, a devastating portrait of the nouveaux riches, New York nightlife, a reckless ambition, an squandered talent, was published in 1922 on the heels of Fitzgerald's first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise</i>. It signaled his maturity as a storyteller and confirmed his enormous talent as a novelist.",

    "description": "From the bestselling author of <i>Einstein\u2019s Dreams </i>comes this harrowing tale of one man's struggle to cope in a wired world, even as his own biological wiring short-circuits. As Boston\u2019s Red Line shuttles Bill Chalmers to work one summer morning, something extraordinary happens. Suddenly, he can't remember which stop is his, where he works, or even who he is. The only thing he can remember is his corporate motto: the maximum information in the minimum time.<br /><br />Bill\u2019s memory returns, but a strange numbness afflicts him. As he attempts to find a diagnosis for his deteriorating illness, he descends into a nightmarish tangle of inconclusive results, his company\u2019s manic frenzy, and his family\u2019s disbelief. Ultimately, Bill discovers that he is fighting not just for his body but also for his soul.",

The Latin Kings, one of the largest and most notorious street gangs in America, became his refuge and his world, but its violence cost him friends, freedom, self-respect, and nearly his life. This is a raw and powerful odyssey through the ranks of the new mafia, where the only people more dangerous than rival gangs are members of your own gang, who in one breath will say they\u2019ll die for you and in the next will order your assassination.<br />",

So he turns to the only friend he can trust: private investigator Philip Marlowe. Marlowe is willing to help a man down on his luck, but later Lennox commits suicide in Mexico and things start to turn nasty. Marlowe is drawn into a sordid crowd of adulterers and alcoholics in LA's Idle Valley, where the rich are suffering one big suntanned hangover. Marlowe is sure Lennox didn't kill his wife, but how many stiffs will turn up before he gets to the truth?",

    "description": "A classic work in political philosophy, intellectual and cultural history, and economics, <i>The Road to Serfdom</i> has inspired and infuriated politicians, scholars, and general readers for half a century. Originally published in England in the spring of 1944\u2014when Eleanor Roosevelt supported the efforts of Stalin, and Albert Einstein subscribed lock, stock, and barrel to the socialist program\u2014<i>The Road to Serfdom</i> was seen as heretical for its passionate warning against the dangers of state control over the means of production. For F. A. Hayek, the collectivist idea of empowering government with increasing economic control would inevitably lead not to a utopia but to the horrors of nazi Germany and fascist Italy.<br /><br />First published by the University of Chicago Press on September 18, 1944, <i>The Road to Serfdom</i> garnered immediate attention from the public, politicians, and scholars alike. The first printing of 2,000 copies was exhausted instantly, and within six months more than 30,000 were sold. In April of 1945, <i>Reader's Digest</i> published a condensed version of the book, and soon thereafter the Book-of-the-Month Club distributed this condensation to more than 600,000 readers. A perennial best-seller, the book has sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States, not including the British edition or the nearly twenty translations into such languages as German, French, Dutch, Swedish, and Japanese, and not to mention the many underground editions produced in Eastern Europe before the fall of the iron curtain.<br /><br />After thirty-two printings in the United States, <i>The Road to Serfdom</i> has established itself alongside the works of Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, and George Orwell for its timeless meditation on the relation between individual liberty and government authority. This fiftieth anniversary edition, with a new introduction by Milton Friedman, commemorates the enduring influence of <i>The Road to Serfdom</i> on the ever-changing political and social climates of the twentieth century, from the rise of socialism after World War II to the Reagan and Thatcher \"revolutions\" in the 1980s and the transitions in Eastern Europe from communism to capitalism in the 1990s.<br /><br />F. A. Hayek (1899-1992), recipient of the Medal of Freedom in 1991 and co-winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1974, was a pioneer in monetary theory and the principal proponent of libertarianism in the twentieth century.<br /><br />On the first American edition of <i>The Road to Serfdom</i>:<br />\"One of the most important books of our generation. . . . It restates for our time the issue between liberty and authority with the power and rigor of reasoning with which John Stuart Mill stated the issue for his own generation in his great essay <i>On Liberty.</i> . . . It is an arresting call to all well-intentioned planners and socialists, to all those who are sincere democrats and liberals at heart to stop, look and listen.\"\u2014Henry Hazlitt, <i>New York Times Book Review,</i> September 1944<br /><br />\"In the negative part of Professor Hayek's thesis there is a great deal of truth. It cannot be said too often\u2014at any rate, it is not being said nearly often enough\u2014that collectivism is not inherently democratic, but, on the contrary, gives to a tyrannical minority such powers as the Spanish Inquisitors never dreamt of.\"\u2014George Orwell, <i>Collected Essays</i>",

    "description": "Set among the upper classes in the gracious, repressive and complex world of 1920s Ceylon (Sri Lanka), this evocative novel tells the story of two people who must determine if it is possible to pursue personal happiness without compromising the happiness of others. A young teacher, Annalukshmi, whose splintered family attempts to arrange an appropriate marriage for her, must decide whether the independence she craves will doom her to a life without love and companionship. It is also the story of Balendran who, respectably married, must suppress-or confront-the secret desires for men that threaten to throw his life into chaos. With sensuous atmosphere and vivid prose, this masterfully plotted novel re-creates a world where a beautiful veneer of fragrant gardens and manners hides social, personal, and political issues still relevant today.<br />",

    "description": "In his first book of short stories, Tibor Fischer examines the lives of loners and failures. With both wit and sobriety, he depicts the trials of a Web site salesman who cannot connect with others, an artist whose career is going nowhere, a failed cowboy, a has-been solicitor, and a stand-up comedienne who has fallen from grace. Laced with exuberant narrative and matchless comic invention, <i>I Like Being Killed </i>reveals the struggle of intelligence to make sense of our modern world.<br />",

    "description": "WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE <br /><br />Virginia Miner, a fifty-something, unmarried tenured professor, is in London to work on her new book about children\u2019s folk rhymes. Despite carrying a U.S. passport, Vinnie feels essentially English and rather looks down on her fellow Americans. But in spite of that, she is drawn into a mortifying and oddly satisfying affair with an Oklahoman tourist who dresses more Bronco Billy than Beau Brummel.<br /><br />Also in London is Vinnie\u2019s colleague Fred Turner, a handsome, flat broke, newly separated, and thoroughly miserable young man trying to focus on his own research. Instead, he is distracted by a beautiful and unpredictable English actress and the world she belongs to. <br /><br />Both American, both abroad, and both achingly lonely, Vinnie and Fred play out their confused alienation and dizzying romantic liaisons in Alison Lurie\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. Smartly written, poignant, and witty, <i>Foreign Affairs</i> remains an enduring comic masterpiece.",

This anthology brings together into one volume the most influential and commonly taught works of existentialism. Contributors include Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Ralph Ellison, Martin Heidegger, Soren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo.",

When Fermina eventually chooses to marry a wealthy, well-born doctor, Florentino is devastated, but he is a romantic. As he rises in his business career he whiles away the years in 622 affairs--yet he reserves his heart for Fermina. Her husband dies at last, and Florentino purposefully attends the funeral. Fifty years, nine months, and four days after he first declared his love for Fermina, he will do so again.",

    "description": "Although Colin Laney (from Gibson's earlier novel <i>Idoru</i>) lives in a cardboard box, he has the power to change the world. Thanks to an experimental drug that he received during his youth, Colin can see \"nodal points\" in the vast streams of data that make up the worldwide computer network. Nodal points are rare but significant events in history that forever change society, even though they might not be recognizable as such when they occur. Colin isn't quite sure what's going to happen when society reaches this latest nodal point, but he knows it's going to be big. And he knows it's going to occur on the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, which has been home to a sort of SoHo-esque shantytown since an earthquake rendered it structurally unsound to carry traffic.<br /><br />Although <i>All Tomorrow's Parties</i> includes characters from two of Gibson's earlier novels, it's not a direct sequel to either. It's a stand-alone book.<i>--Craig E. Engler</i>",
