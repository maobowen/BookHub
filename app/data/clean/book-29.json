    "description": "<i>The Wild Ass's Skin</i> is Honor\u00e9 de Balzac's 1831 novel that tells the story of a young man, Rapha\u00ebl de Valentin, who discovers a piece of shagreen, in this case a rough untanned piece of a wild ass's skin, which has the magical property of granting wishes. However the fulfillment of the wisher's desire comes at a cost, after each wish the skin shrinks a little bit and consumes the physical energy of the wisher. \"The Wild Ass's Skin\" is at once both a work of incredible realism, in the descriptions of Parisian life and culture at the time, and also a work of supernatural fantasy, in the desires that are fulfilled by the wild ass's skin. Balzac uses this fantastical device masterfully to depict the complexity of the human nature in civilized society.",

    "description": "A Journalist Investigates Scientific Evidence That Points Toward God: 'My road to atheism was paved by science . . . But, ironically, so was my later journey to God.' - Lee Strobel<br /><br />During his academic years, Lee Strobel became convinced that God was outmoded, a belief that colored his ensuing career as an award-winning journalist at the Chicago Tribune. Science had made the idea of a Creator irrelevant - or so Strobel thought. But today science is pointing in a different direction. In recent years, a diverse and impressive body of research has increasingly supported the conclusion that the universe was intelligently designed. At the same time, Darwinism has faltered in the face of concrete facts and hard reason.Has science discovered God? At the very least, it's giving faith an immense boost as new findings emerge about the incredible complexity of our universe. Join Strobel as he re-examines the theories that once led him away from God. Through his compelling and highly readable account, you'll encounter the mind-stretching discoveries from cosmology, cellular biology, DNA research, astronomy, physics, and human consciousness that present astonishing evidence in The Case for a Creator.",

    "description": "The twentieth century is usually seen as \"the century of total war.\" But as the historian David Bell argues in this landmark work, the phenomenon acutally began much earlier, in the era of muskets, cannons, and sailing ships -- in the age of Napoleon.<br /><br />In a sweeping, evocative narrative, Bell takes us from campaigns of \"extermination\" in the blood-soaked fields of western France to savage street fighting in ruined Spanish cities to central European battlefields where tens of thousands died in a single day. Between 1792 and 1815, Europe plunged into an abyss of destruction.<br /><br />It was during this time, Bell argues, that our modern attitudes toward war were born. In the eighteenth century, educated Europeans thought war was disappearing from the civilized world. So when large-scale conflict broke out during the French Revolution, they could not resist treating it as \"the last war\" -- a final, terrible spasm of redemptive violence that would usher in a reign of perpetual peace. As this brilliant interpretive history shows, a war for such stakes could only be apocalyptic, fought without restraint or mercy.<br /><br />Ever since, the dream of perpetual peace and the nightmare of total war have been bound tightly together in the Western world -- right down to the present day, in which the hopes for an \"end to history\" after the cold war quickly gave way to renewed fears of full-scale slaughter.<br /><br />With a historian's keen insight and a journalist's flair for detail, Bell exposes the surprising parallels between Napoleon's day and our own -- including the way that ambition \"wars of liberation,\" such as the one in Iraq, can degenerate into a gruesome guerrilla conflict. The result is a book that is as timely and important as it is unforgettable.",

Christopher is fifteen and has Asperger's, a form of autism. He knows a very great deal about maths and very little about human beings. He loves lists, patterns and the truth.

Seventeen-year-old Edward Zanni, a feckless Ferris Bueller\u2013type, is Peter Panning his way through a carefree summer of magic and mischief. The fun comes to a halt, however, when Edward\u2019s father remarries and refuses to pay for Edward to study acting at Juilliard.<br /><br />Edward\u2019s truly in a bind. He\u2019s ineligible for scholarships because his father earns too much. He\u2019s unable to contact his mother because she\u2019s somewhere in Peru trying to commune with Incan spirits. And, as a sure sign he\u2019s destined for a life in the arts, Edward\u2019s incapable of holding down a job. So he turns to his loyal (but immoral) misfit friends to help him steal the tuition money from his father, all the while practicing for his high school performance of <i>Grease</i>. Disguising themselves as nuns and priests, they merrily scheme their way through embezzlement, money laundering, identity theft, forgery, and blackmail. But, along the way, Edward also learns the value of friendship, hard work, and how you\u2019re not really a man until you can beat up your father\u2014metaphorically, that is.<br /><br /><i>How I Paid for College</i> is a farcical coming-of-age story that combines the first-person tone of David Sedaris with the byzantine plot twists of Armistead Maupin. It is a novel for anyone who has ever had a dream or a scheme, and it marks the introduction to an original and audacious talent.",

    "description": "The foundation for a general system of morals, this 1749 work is a landmark in the history of moral and political thought. Readers familiar with Adam Smith from <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> will find this earlier book a revelation. Although the author is often misrepresented as a calculating rationalist who advises the pursuit of self-interest in the marketplace, regardless of the human cost, he was also interested in the human capacity for benevolence \u2014 as <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i> amply demonstrates.<br />The greatest prudence, Smith suggests, may lie in following economic self-interest in order to secure the basic necessities. This is only the first step, however, toward the much higher goal of achieving a morally virtuous life. Smith elaborates upon a theory of the imagination inspired by the philosophy of David Hume. His reasoning takes Hume's logic a step further by proposing a more sophisticated notion of sympathy, leading to a series of highly original theories involving conscience, moral judgment, and virtue.<br />Smith's legacy consists of his reconstruction of the Enlightenment idea of a moral, or social, science that embraces both political economy and the theory of law and government. His articulate expression of his philosophy continues to inspire and challenge modern readers.",

Bushi no ichi-gon--the word of a samurai or in exact German equivalent ein Ritterwort --was sufficient guaranty of the truthfulness of an assertion.

Many thrilling anecdotes were told of those who atoned by death for ni-gon, a double tongue.",

    "description": "The story of the relationship between Ab\u00e9lard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse is one of the world\u2019s most celebrated and tragic love affairs. It is told through the letters of Peter Ab\u00e9lard, a French philosopher and one of the greatest logicians of the twelfth century, and of his gifted pupil H\u00e9lo\u00efse. Through their impassioned writings unfolds the story of a romance, from its reckless, ecstatic beginnings through to public scandal, an enforced secret marriage and its devastating consequences. These eloquent and intimate letters express a vast range of emotions from adoration and devotion to reproach, indignation and grief, and offer a fascinating insight into religious life in the Middle Ages.<br /><br />This is the revised edition of Betty Radice's highly regarded translation, in which Michael Clanchy, the biographer of Ab\u00e9lard, updates the scholarship on the letters and the lovers. This volume includes Ab\u00e9lard's remarkable autobiography and his spiritual advice to H\u00e9lo\u00efse and her nuns, as well as a selection of the 'lost love letters' of Ab\u00e9lard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse, letters between H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Peter the Venerable, two of Ab\u00e9lard's hymns, a chronology, notes and maps.",

And to the portly and good-natured Mercy, the Watsons are an excellent source of buttered toast, not to mention that buttery-toasty feeling she gets when she snuggles into bed with them. This is not, however, so good for the Watsons' bed. BOOM! CRACK! As the bed and its occupants slowly sink through the floor, Mercy escapes in a flash \u2014 \"to alert the fire department,\" her owners assure themselves. But could Mercy possibly have another emergency in mind \u2014 like a sudden craving for their neighbors' sugar cookies?",

    "description": "Marrell, a happily married army wife, adores her family, but throughout her life she\u2019s felt something missing. When she discovers that the void is spiritual, she is afraid to tell her husband. Will he understand that he cannot meet all of her needs, and that she cannot meet all of his?<br /><br />Covering the lives of Marrell and her two daughters, Mackenzie and Delancey, from the 1970s to the 1990s. On the outside, the Bishop girls appear as different as sisters can be. Mackenzie is a mahogany-haired beauty who's inherited the determined nature of her Army officer father. Her infectious sense of humor and rare gift of imagination are often hidden by a reserved manner. Radiant, blond Delancey views the world through an artist's eyes, drawing what she sees with wide sweeps of emotion. Her charming and trusting personality easily wins friends and admirers, but also leaves her sensitive heart vulnerable to hurt. <br /><br />As the girls grow, unexpected difficulties threaten their world. Will their life-changing experiences bring them together or tear them apart? Where will they find the love they seek?<br /><br />Pretense is a character\u2013rich novel written from Lori\u2019s heart that shows the patient love of God and the promise of His forgiveness for all who seek Him.",

    "description": "Five disparate voices inhabit Ali Smith's dreamlike, mesmerising <i>Hotel World</i>, set in the luxurious anonymity of the Global Hotel, in an unnamed northern English city. The disembodied yet interconnected characters include Sara, a 19-year-old chambermaid who has recently died at the hotel; her bereaved sister, Clare, who visits the scene of Sara's death; Penny, an advertising copywriter who is staying in the room opposite; Lise, the Global's depressed receptionist; and the homeless Else who begs on the street outside. Smith's ambitious prose explores all facets of language and its uses. Sara takes us through the moment of her exit from the world and beyond; in her desperate, fading grip on words and senses she gropes to impart the meaning of her death in what she terms \"the lift for dishes\"--then comes a flash of clarity: \"That's the name for it, the name for it; that's it; dumb waiter dumb waiter dumb waiter.\" Blended with hers are other voices: Penny's bland journalese and Else's obsession with metaphysical poetry. <p> <i>Hotel World</i> is not an easy read: disturbing and witty by turns, with its stream-of-consciousness narrators reminiscent of Virgina Woolf's <i>The Waves</i>, its deceptively rambling language is underpinned by a formal construction. Exploring the \"big themes\" of love, death and millennial capitalism, it takes as its starting point Muriel Spark's <i>Momento Mori</i> (\"Remember you must die\") and counteracts this axiom with a resolute \"Remember you must live\". Ali Smith's novel is a daring, compelling, and frankly spooky read. --<i>Catherine Taylor</i></p>",

Hobie's certain 4B will never be so lucky. Their regular fourth grade teacher, Mr. Star, is as healthy as a horse. The very next day, though, Mr. Star rushes out of the room -- \"indisposed,\" the principal says -- and Hobie and his classmates hear \"s-u-b.\" They are prepared. No stranger could possibly withstand the volley from their vast arsenal of sub sinkers. Except, perhaps, Miss Ivanovitch. It soon becomes clear that it might not be the sub who sinks -- this time, it might just be the students.",

You\u2019re going to have to get a light-skinned husband for the sake of your children as it is.\u201d<br /><br /></i>In these words from her mother, novelist and memoirist Marita Golden learned as a girl that she was the wrong color. Her mother had absorbed \u201ccolorism\u201d without thinking about it. But, as Golden shows in this provocative book, biases based on skin color persist\u2013and so do their long-lasting repercussions. <br /><br />Golden recalls deciding against a distinguished black university because she didn\u2019t want to worry about whether she was light enough to be homecoming queen. A male friend bitterly remembers that he was teased about his girlfriend because she was too dark for him. Even now, when she attends a party full of accomplished black men and their wives, Golden wonders why those wives are all nearly white. From Halle Berry to Michael Jackson, from Nigeria to Cuba, from what she sees in the mirror to what she notices about the Grammys, Golden exposes the many facets of \"colorism\" and their effect on American culture. Part memoir, part cultural history, and part analysis, <b>Don't Play in the Sun </b>also dramatizes one accomplished black woman's inner journey from self-loathing to self-acceptance and pride.",

    "description": "On election day in the capital, it is raining so hard that no one has bothered to go out to vote. The politicians are growing jittery. Should they reschedule the elections for another day? Around three o' clock, the rain finally stops. Promptly at four, voters rush to the polling stations, as if they had been ordered to appear.<br /><br />But when the ballots are counted, more than 70 percent are blank. The citizens are rebellious. A state of emergency is declared. But are the authorities acting too precipitously? Or even blindly? The word evokes terrible memories of the plague of blindness that hit the city four years before, and of the one woman who kept her sight. Could she be behind the blank ballots? A police superintendent is put on the case.<br /><br />What begins as a satire on governments and the sometimes dubious efficacy of the democratic system turns into something far more sinister. A singular novel from the author of Blindness.",

    "description": "The aerial attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center, a global spectacle of unprecedented dimensions, generated an enormous volume of commentary. The inviolability of the American mainland, breached for the first time since 1812, led to extravagant proclamations by the pundits. It was a new world-historical turning point. The 21st century, once greeted triumphantly as marking the dawn of a worldwide neo-liberal civilization, suddenly became menaced. The choice presented from the White House and its supporters was to stand shoulder-to-shoulder against terrorism or be damned.<br /><br />Tariq Ali challenges these assumptions, arguing instead that what we have experienced is the return of History in a horrific form, with religious symbols playing a part on both sides: \u2018Allah\u2019s revenge,\u2019 \u2018God is on Our Side\u2019 and \u2018God Bless America.\u2019 The visible violence of September 11 was the response to the invisible violence that has been inflicted on countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Palestine and Chechnya. Some of this has been the direct responsibility of the United States and Russia. In this wide-ranging book that provides an explanation for both the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and new forms of Western colonialism, Tariq Ali argues that many of the values proclaimed by the Enlightenment retain their relevance, while portrayals of the American Empire as a new emancipatory project are misguided.",

Slade Steadman, a writer who has lost his chops, sets out for the Ecuadorian jungle with his ex-girlfriend in search of inspiration and a rare hallucinogen. The drug, once found, heightens both his powers of perception and his libido, but it also leaves him with an unfortunate side effect: periodic blindness. Unable to resist the insights that enable him to write again, Steadman spends the next year of his life in thrall to his psychedelic muse and his erotic fantasies, with consequences that are both ecstatic and disastrous.",

Dr. Rahula\u2019s <i>What the Buddha Taught</i> fills the need as only could be done by one having a firm grasp of the vast material to be sifted. It is a model of what a book should be that is addressed first of all to \u0091the educated and intelligent reader.\u2019 Authoritative and clear, logical and sober, this study is as comprehensive as it is masterly.\u201d<p>This edition contains a selection of illustrative texts from the <i>Suttas</i> and the <i>Dhammapada</i> (specially translated by the author), sixteen illustrations, and a bibliography, glossary and index.</p>",

    "description": "One of the most important &amp; influential books written in the past half-century, Robert M. Pirsig's <i>Zen &amp; the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> is a powerfully moving &amp; penetrating examination of how we live, a breathtaking meditation on how to live better. Here is the book that transformed a generation, an unforgettable narration of a summer motorcycle trip across America's Northwest, undertaken by a father &amp; his young son. A story of love &amp; fear--of growth, discovery &amp; acceptance--that becomes a profound personal &amp; philosophical odyssey into life's fundamental questions, this uniquely exhilarating modern classic is both touching &amp; transcendent, resonant with the myriad confusions of existence &amp; the small, essential triumphs that propel us forward.",

In a manner unmistakably his own, Murchie delves into the interconnectedness of all life on the planet and of such fields as biology, geology, sociology, mathematics, and physics. He offers us what the poet May Sarton has called \"a good book to take to a desert island as sole companion, so rich is it in knowledge and insight.\"",

    "description": "The acclaimed author of <b>The Cloud Atlas</b> returns with a wondrous second novel. Set in a small beachfront Catholic high school, narrated by a beautifully complex heroine\u2013theology teacher Emily Hamilton\u2013All Saints is at once a mystery, a love story, and a powerful rumination on secrets, temptation, and faith. <br /><br />By life\u2019s midpoint Emily has seen three husbands, dozens of friends, and hundreds of students come and go. And now her classroom, long her refuge, is proving to be <br />anything but. <br /><br />Though her popular, occasionally irreverent church history course is rich with stories of long-dead saints, Emily uneasily discovers that it\u2019s her own tumultuous life that fascinates certain students most. She in turn finds herself drawn into their world, their secrets, and the fateful choices they make. <br /><br />A novel of mystery and illumination, calling and choice, All Saints explores lives lived in a fragile sanctuary\u2013from Emily and her many saints to a priest facing his own mortality and a teenager tormented by desire. Told with grace and compassion, this is a spellbinding novel of provocative storytelling.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "My lady, Fiammetta Bianchini, was plucking her eyebrows and biting color into her lips when the unthinkable happened and the Holy Roman Emperor's army blew a hole in the wall of God's eternal city, letting in a flood of half-starved, half-crazed troops bent on pillage and punishment.<br />\"<br />\"Thus begins In the Company of the Courtesan, Sarah Dunant's epic novel of life in Renaissance Italy. Escaping the sack of Rome in 1527, with their stomachs churning on the jewels they have swallowed, the courtesan Fiammetta and her dwarf companion, Bucino, head for Venice, the shimmering city born out of water to become a miracle of east-west trade: rich and rancid, pious and profitable, beautiful and squalid. <br />With a mix of courage and cunning they infiltrate Venetian society. Together they make the perfect partnership: the sharp-tongued, sharp-witted dwarf, and his vibrant mistress, trained from birth to charm, entertain, and satisfy men who have the money to support her. <br />Yet as their fortunes rise, this perfect partnership comes under threat, from the searing passion of a lover who wants more than his allotted nights to the attentions of an admiring Turk in search of human novelties for his sultan's court. But Fiammetta and Bucino's greatest challenge comes from a young crippled woman, a blind healer who insinuates herself into their lives and hearts with devastating consequences for them all. <br />A story of desire and deception, sin and religion, loyalty and friendship, In the Company of the Courtesan paints a portrait of one of the world's greatest cities at its most potent moment in history: It is a picture that remains vivid long after the final page. \"From the Hardcover edition.\"",

Now part of the Voyager Classics collection.<br /><br />The Martian Chronicles tells the story of humanity\u2019s repeated attempts to colonize the red planet. The first men were few. Most succumbed to a disease they called the Great Loneliness when they saw their home planet dwindle to the size of a fist. They felt they had never been born. Those few that survived found no welcome on Mars. The shape-changing Martians thought they were native lunatics and duly locked them up.<br /><br />But more rockets arrived from Earth, and more, piercing the hallucinations projected by the Martians. People brought their old prejudices with them \u2013 and their desires and fantasies, tainted dreams. These were soon inhabited by the strange native beings, with their caged flowers and birds of flame.<br /><br />Contents:<br />Rocket Summer<br />Ylla<br />The Summer Night<br />The Earth Men<br />The Taxpayer<br />The Third Expedition<br />-And the Moon Be Still As Bright<br />The Settlers<br />The Green Morning<br />The Locusts<br />Night Meeting<br />The Shore<br />Interim<br />The Musicians<br />Way in the Middle of the Air<br />The Naming of Names<br />Usher II<br />The Old Ones<br />The Martian<br />The Luggage Store<br />The Off Season<br />The Watchers<br />The Silent Towns<br />The Long Years<br />There Will Come Soft Rains<br />The Million Year Picnic",

    "description": "Almost a century after its original publication, Thorstein Veblen's work is as fresh and relevant as ever. Veblen's <i>The Theory of the Leisure Class</i> is in the tradition of Adam Smith's <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> and Thomas Hobbes's <i>Leviathan</i>, yet it provides a surprisingly contemporary look at American economics and society. Establishing such terms as \"conspicuous consumption\" and \"pecuniary emulation,\" Veblen's most famous work has become an archetype not only of economic theory, but of historical and sociological thought as well. As sociologist Alan Wolfe writes in his Introduction, Veblen \"skillfully . . . wrote a book that will be read so long as the rich are different from the rest of us; which, if the future is anything like the past, they always will be.\"",

A radiation bomb planted in his dorm room changed him from an innocent student at the University of Earth to a marked man, fleeing desperately from an unknown assassin.<br /><br />He soon discovers that, many light-years away, his father, the highly respected Rancher of Widemos, has been murdered. Stunned, grief-stricken, and outraged, Biron is determined to uncover the reasons behind his father\u2019s death, and becomes entangled in an intricate saga of rebellion, political intrigue, and espionage.<br /><br />The mystery takes him deep into space where he finds himself in a relentless struggle with the power-mad despots of Tyrann. Now it is not just a case of life or death for Biron, but a question of freedom for the galaxy.",

Once he was outbound, where the Society that ruled Earth could not reach him, he headed his starship toward the galactic core, where the unimaginable energies of the Universe wrenched the fabric of time and space and promised final escape from his captors.<br /><br />Then he returned to an Earth eons older than the one he'd left...a planet that had had 3,000,000 years to develop perils he had never dreamed of -- perils that became nightmares that he had to escape...somehow!",

    "description": "This is the life and times of T. S. Garp, the bastard son of Jenny Fields--a feminist leader ahead of her times. This is the life and death of a famous mother and her almost-famous son; theirs is a world of sexual extremes--even of sexual assassinations. It is a novel rich with \"lunacy and sorrow\"; yet the dark, violent events of the story do not undermine a comedy both ribald and robust. In more than thirty languages, in more than forty countries--with more than ten million copies in print--this novel provides almost cheerful, even hilarious evidence of its famous last line: \"In the world according to Garp, we are all terminal cases.\"<br /><br /><i>The World According to Garp</i> is a comic and compassionate coming-of-age novel that established John Irving as one of the most imaginative writers of his generation. A worldwide bestseller since its publication in 1978, Irving's classic is filled with stories inside stories about the life and times of T. S. Garp, novelist and bastard son of Jenny Fields--a feminist leader ahead of her time. Beyond that, <i>The World According to Garp</i> virtually defies synopsis.<br /><br />(From author's website: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.john-irving.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.john-irving.com</a>)",

    "description": "Walter Benjamin is widely acknowledged as amongst the greatest literary critics of this century, and <i>The Origin of German Tragic Drama</i> is his most sustained and original work. Indeed, Georg Lukacs\u2014one of the most trenchant opponents of Benjamin\u2019s aesthetics\u2014singled out this work as one of the main sources of literary modernism in the twentieth century.<br /><br /><i>The Origin of German Tragic Drama</i> begins with a general theoretical introduction on the nature of the baroque art of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, concentrating on the peculiar stage-form of the royal martyr dramas called <i>Trauerspiel</i>. Benjamin also comments on the engravings of Durer, and the theatre of Shakespeare and Calderon. Baroque tragedy, he argues, was distinguished from classical tragedy by its shift from myth into history.<br /><br />The characteristic atmosphere of the <i>Trauerspiel</i> was consequently \u2018melancholy\u2019. The emblems of baroque allegory point to the extinct values of a classical world that they can never attain or repeat. Their suggestive power, however, remains to haunt subsequent cultures, down to this century.",

    "description": "Many churchgoers complain that their churches lack a coherent plan for discipleship and spiritual growth. In turn, many church leaders lament their lack of resources to build and manage effective programs to help people become fully devoted followers of Christ. In<em>Transforming Discipleship</em> Greg Ogden introduces his vision for discipleship, emphasizing that solutions will not be found in large-scale, finely-tuned, resource-heavy programs. Instead, Ogden recovers Jesus' method of accomplishing life change by investing in just a few people at a time. And he shows how discipleship can become a self-replicating process with ongoing impact from generation to generation. Biblical, practical and tremendously effective, <em>Transforming Discipleship</em> provides the insights and philosophy of ministry behind Ogden's earlier work, <em>Discipleship Essentials.</em> Together, these ground-breaking books have the potential to transform how your church transforms the lives of its people.",

    "description": "Before Joseph Campbell became the world's most famous practitioner of comparative mythology, there was Sir James George Frazer. <i>The Golden Bough</i> was originally published in two volumes in 1890, but Frazer became so enamored of his topic that over the next few decades he expanded the work sixfold, then in 1922 cut it all down to a single thick edition suitable for mass distribution. The thesis on the origins of magic and religion that it elaborates \"will be long and laborious,\" Frazer warns readers, \"but may possess something of the charm of a voyage of discovery, in which we shall visit many strange lands, with strange foreign peoples, and still stranger customs.\" Chief among those customs--at least as the book is remembered in the popular imagination--is the sacrificial killing of god-kings to ensure bountiful harvests, which Frazer traces through several cultures, including in his elaborations the myths of Adonis, Osiris, and Balder.<p> While highly influential in its day, <i>The Golden Bough</i> has come under harsh critical scrutiny in subsequent decades, with many of its descriptions of regional folklore and legends deemed less than reliable. Furthermore, much of its tone is rooted in a philosophy of social Darwinism--sheer cultural imperialism, really--that finds its most explicit form in Frazer's rhetorical question: \"If in the most backward state of human society now known to us we find magic thus conspicuously present and religion conspicuously absent, may we not reasonably conjecture that the civilised races of the world have also at some period of their history passed through a similar intellectual phase?\" (The truly civilized races, he goes on to say later, though not particularly loudly, are the ones whose minds evolve beyond religious belief to embrace the rational structures of scientific thought.) Frazer was much too genteel to state plainly that \"primitive\" races believe in magic because they are too stupid and backwards to know any better; instead he remarks that \"a savage hardly conceives the distinction commonly drawn by more advanced peoples between the natural and the supernatural.\" And he certainly was not about to make explicit the logical extension of his theories--\"that Christian legend, dogma, and ritual\" (to quote Robert Graves's summation of Frazer in <i>The White Goddess</i>) \"are the refinement of a great body of primitive and barbarous beliefs.\" Whatever modern readers have come to think of the book, however, its historical significance and the eloquence with which Frazer attempts to develop what one might call a unifying theory of anthropology cannot be denied. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>",

This new translation of <i>Volume One</i>, the only volume to be completed and edited by Marx himself, avoids some of the mistakes that have marred earlier versions and seeks to do justice to the literary qualities of the work. The introduction is by Ernest Mandel, author of <i>Late Capitalism</i>, one of the only comprehensive attempts to develop the theoretical legacy of Capital.",

    "description": "Tobacco companies had been protecting their turf for decades. They had congressmen in their pocket. They had corrupt scientists who made excuses about nicotine, cancer and addiction. They had hordes of lawyers to threaten anyone\u2014inside the industry or out\u2014who posed a problem. They had a whole lot of money to spend. And they were good at getting people to do what they wanted them to do. After all, they had already convinced millions of Americans to take up an addictive, unhealthy, and potentially deadly habit.<br /><br /> David Kessler didn't care about all that. In this book he tells for the first time the thrilling detective story of how the underdog FDA\u2014while safeguarding the nation's food, drugs, and blood supply\u2014finally decided to take on one of the world's most powerful opponents, and how it won. Like <i>A Civil Action</i> or <i>And the Band Played On, A Question of Intent</i> weaves together science, law, and fascinating characters to tell an important and often unexpectedly moving story. We follow Kessler's team of investigators as they race to find the clues that will allow the FDA to assert jurisdiction over cigarettes, while the tobacco companies and their lawyers fight back\u2014hard. Full of insider information and drama, told with wit, and animated by its author's moral passion, <i>A Question of Intent</i> reads like a Grisham thriller, with one exception\u2014everything in it is true.<br />",

    "description": "On the murderous road to \"racial purity\" Hitler encountered unexpected detours, largely due to his own crazed views and inconsistent policies regarding Jewish identity. After centuries of Jewish assimilation and intermarriage in German society, he discovered that eliminating Jews from the rest of the population was more difficult than he'd anticipated. As Bryan Rigg shows in this provocative new study, nowhere was that heinous process more fraught with contradiction and confusion than in the German military.<br /><br />Contrary to conventional views, Rigg reveals that a startlingly large number of German military men were classified by the Nazis as Jews or \"partial-Jews\" (Mischlinge), in the wake of racial laws first enacted in the mid-1930s. Rigg demonstrates that the actual number was much higher than previously thought-perhaps as many as 150,000 men, including decorated veterans and high-ranking officers, even generals and admirals.<br /><br />As Rigg fully documents for the first time, a great many of these men did not even consider themselves Jewish and had embraced the military as a way of life and as devoted patriots eager to serve a revived German nation. In turn, they had been embraced by the Wehrmacht, which prior to Hitler had given little thought to the \"race\" of these men but which was now forced to look deeply into the ancestry of its soldiers.<br /><br />The process of investigation and removal, however, was marred by a highly inconsistent application of Nazi law. Numerous \"exemptions\" were made in order to allow a soldier to stay within the ranks or to spare a soldier's parent, spouse, or other relative from incarceration or far worse. (Hitler's own signature can be found on many of these \"exemption\" orders.) But as the war dragged on, Nazi politics came to trump military logic, even in the face of the Wehrmacht's growing manpower needs, closing legal loopholes and making it virtually impossible for these soldiers to escape the fate of millions of other victims of the Third Reich.<br /><br />Based on a deep and wide-ranging research in archival and secondary sources, as well as extensive interviews with more than four hundred Mischlinge and their relatives, Rigg's study breaks truly new ground in a crowded field and shows from yet another angle the extremely flawed, dishonest, demeaning, and tragic essence of Hitler's rule.",

    "description": "An instant bestseller in both hardcover and paperback, Hope Edelman's <i>Motherless Daughters</i> explores the myriad ways that losing a mother can affect almost every aspect and passage of a woman's life. First published a decade ago, it is still the book that motherless daughters of all ages look to for understanding and comfort and that they press into each other's hands. Building on interviews with hundreds of mother-loss survivors, this life-affirming book is now newly expanded to reflect the author's personal experience with the continued legacy of mother loss; now married and a mother of young children herself, Edelman better understands how the effects of mother loss change over time and in light of new relationships. A work of stunning courage and honesty, <i>Motherless Daughters</i> is a must read for the millions of women whose mothers have gone, but whose need for healing, mourning, and mothering remains. It is a timeless classic.",

The author, a German refugee, examines the climate and conditions that gave rise to a vicious campaign against Germany's gays, as directed by Himmler and his SS--persecution that resulted in tens of thousands of arrests and thousands of deaths.<br /><br />In this Nazi crusade, homosexual prisoners were confined to death camps where, forced to wear pink triangles, they constituted the lowest rung in the camp hierarchy. The horror of camp life is described through diaries, previously untranslated documents, and interviews with and letters from survivors, revealing how the anti-homosexual campaign was conducted, the crackpot homophobic fantasies that fueled it, the men who made it possible, and those who were its victims, this chilling book sheds light on a corner of twentieth-century history that has been hidden in the shadows much too long.",

    "description": "<b>From the author of <i>House of Outrageous Fortune</i></b><br /><br />For seventy-five years, it\u2019s been Manhattan\u2019s richest apartment building, and one of the most lusted-after addresses in the world. One apartment had 37 rooms, 14 bathrooms, 43 closets, 11 working fireplaces, a private elevator, and his-and-hers saunas; another at one time had a live-in service staff of 16. To this day, it is steeped in the purest luxury, the kind most of us could only imagine, until now. <br /><br />The last great building to go up along New York\u2019s Gold Coast, construction on 740 Park finished in 1930. Since then, 740 has been home to an ever-evolving cadre of our wealthiest and most powerful families, some of America\u2019s (and the world\u2019s) oldest money\u2014the kind attached to names like Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, Bouvier, Chrysler, Niarchos, Houghton, and Harkness\u2014and some whose names evoke the excesses of today\u2019s monied elite: Kravis, Koch, Bronfman, Perelman, Steinberg, and Schwarzman. All along, the building has housed titans of industry, political power brokers, international royalty, fabulous scam-artists, and even the lowest scoundrels.<br /><br />The book begins with the tumultuous story of the building\u2019s construction. Conceived in the bubbling financial, artistic, and social cauldron of 1920\u2019s Manhattan, 740 Park rose to its dizzying heights as the stock market plunged in 1929\u2014the building was in dire financial straits before the first apartments were sold. The builders include the architectural genius Rosario Candela, the scheming businessman James T. Lee (Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis\u2019s grandfather), and a raft of financiers, many of whom were little more than white-collar crooks and grand-scale hustlers. <br /><br />Once finished, 740 became a magnet for the richest, oldest families in the country: the Brewsters, descendents of the leader of the Plymouth Colony; the socially-registered Bordens, Hoppins, Scovilles, Thornes, and Schermerhorns; and top executives of the Chase Bank, American Express, and U.S. Rubber. Outside the walls of 740 Park, these were the people shaping America culturally and economically. Within those walls, they were indulging in all of the Seven Deadly Sins. <br /><br />As the social climate evolved throughout the last century, so did 740 Park: after World War II, the building\u2019s rulers eased their more restrictive policies and began allowing Jews (though not to this day African Americans) to reside within their hallowed walls. Nowadays, it is full to bursting with new money, people whose fortunes, though freshly-made, are large enough to buy their way in. <br /><br />At its core this book is a social history of the American rich, and how the locus of power and influence has shifted haltingly from old bloodlines to new money. But it\u2019s also much more than that: filled with meaty, startling, often tragic stories of the people who lived behind 740\u2019s walls, the book gives us an unprecedented access to worlds of wealth, privilege, and extraordinary folly that are usually hidden behind a scrim of money and influence. This is, truly, how the other half\u2014or at least the other one hundredth of one percent\u2014lives.",

    "description": "We wear ourselves out trying to be smarter, bigger, the center of attention. But dynamic communicator Louie Giglio's latest book puts success back in perspective. When John the Baptist said that he must decrease while Jesus must increase, he was expressing the secret to astonishing freedom...and incredible rest. This book will teach you the rich, meaningful lifestyle of being small. Free from the worries that used to strangle you, you'll radiate the power of the God who is all the things you \"aren't! \" <br />\"I am not,\" but God knows my name. <br />\"I am not,\" but He has pursued me in His love. <br />\"I am not,\" but I know the Creator of the universe. <br />\"I am not,\" but I know \"I AM!\" <br />If you see life as your own one-act play and history as your story, you could be in for a rude awakening when the curtain finally closes on your tiny tale--and you discover that life wasn't all about you after all. <br />The real story of life is God--\"I AM--\"the main character and true star of time and eternity. He is at center stage in all of Creation, and He wants you to know Him by name. Knowing \"I AM\" means embracing your smallness in light of His greatness. <br />Savor the true meaning of life as you learn to work and rest in His power, spending your life for what lasts forever--the unending glory that is God's alone. <br />Story Behind the Book <br />Louie Giglio recognizes a world and culture that keeps pushing us to be bigger, to be known, to be on top, to be at the center of everything. He encourages those who know how to right-size it all. Instead of pumping up their own programs, agendas, ideas, and plans, their goal is to keep getting smaller in order for Jesus to get bigger. Regarding themselves in relation to Jesus, they have the same goal John the Baptist had: \"He must increase, I must decrease.\"",

    "description": "In this dazzling conjunction of subject and author, the great English novelist Aldous Huxley, the wholly civilized man, is brought wholly alive in a magnificent full-scale biography by the brilliant English novelist Sybille Bedford, an intimate friend of the Huxleys through four decades. With a pointillistic richness of moment, place, and talk, she re-creates not only the private Huxley and the literary Huxley but the entire intellectual and social era to which he was central. Despite the almost total loss of his sight at age sixteen, Huxley became a titan and cultural hero of the decades after World War I, on terms with the outstanding writers and artists of his day, from D. H. Lawrence to Stravinksy and Auden. He had two separate and large careers as Crome Yellow and Point Counter Point, flag-bearer of England s Bright Young People through the 1920s, and romancer of glittering women; and later, in America, as the increasingly philosophical and utopian thinker, and a pioneering explorer of the frontiers of the human mind. Drawing on his letters and diaries, the memories of his intimates, and her own sharp and sensitive comprehension of Huxley s writings, Mrs. Bedford has written a masterful biography. \"Her novelist s eye,\" writes V. S. Pritchett, \"brings the writer to life. Huxley becomes a living, deeply attractive presence, while his great contemporaries flash through these pages in memorable and moving encounters. Mrs. Bedford s biography stands as the major work on a major figure in the literary and intellectual history of the twentieth century.\"",

Elnora attends school against her mother's wishes, fighting every inch of the way for her dream of an education, and collects and sells moths and other rare biological specimens from the swamp to pay for her schooling, books, and bare necessities. At first a laughingstock of her fellow students, Elnora persists against unfair odds, and asserts her true self.<br /><br />A wonderful turn-of-the-century novel of discovery of identity, wonders of nature, friendship, family trust, love, and the process of growing up in the magical shadow of the Limberlost.",

    "description": "Edward McPherson traces Buster Keaton's career from his early days in vaudeville--where as a rambunctious five-year-old his father threw him around the stage--to his becoming one of the brightest stars of silent film's Golden Age. Taking what he knew from vaudeville--ingenuity, athleticism, audacity and wit--Keaton applied his hand to the new medium of film, proving himself a prodigious acrobat and brilliant writer, gagman, director and actor in more than 100 films. Between 1920 and 1929, he rivaled Fatty Arbuckle, Harold Lloyd, and even Charlie Chaplin as the master of silent comedy by writing, directing, and starring in more than 30 films. The book celebrates Keaton in his prime--as an antic genius, equal parts auteur, innovator, prankster and daredevil--while also revealing the pressures in his personal and professional life that led to a collapse into drunkenness and despair before his triumphant second act as a television pioneer and Hollywood player in everything from beach movies to Beckett. McPherson describes the life of Keaton--in front of the camera and behind the scenes--with the kind of exuberance and narrative energy displayed by the shrewd, madcap films themselves.",

There is no hotter issue than gay marriage in the culture-war debate, and Dan Savage, one of America's most outspoken and beloved columnists, takes it on and makes it personal in this rollicking memoir of coming to terms with the very public act of marriage.

A ruthless and carefully planned strategy---one that not even Damali will anticipate---has been developed. There is only one entity who can best Damali, send Carlos packing, and put the Guardian team at mortal risk. This powerful being was once banished into a forsaken land and possesses everything that would bring a Neteru to his or her knees. This time the fight is not so clear-cut, and it is not only Damali's soul in the balance but her body and heart as well.",

They don\u2019t describe many as Dadaist, even the ones who know what \u2018Dadaist\u2019 means. But how else does one explain choreographed dancing gunmen in Buchanan Street, or the surreal methods they use to stay one step ahead of the cops?<br /><br />Angelique de Xavia is no art critic, but she is a connoisseur of crooks, and she\u2019s sure that the heist she got caught up in wasn\u2019t the work of the usual sawn-offs-and-black-tights practitioners indigenous to the parish. She knows she\u2019s dealing with a unique species of thief, and it\u2019s her job to hunt him to extinction \u2013 though the fact that it\u2019s not just his m.o. that\u2019s cute might prove a distraction.<br /><br />This thief, however, has greater concerns than his own safety, and a secret agenda more valuable than anything he might steal. He can afford to play cat and mouse with the female cop who\u2019s on his tail; it might even arguably be necessary. What he can\u2019t afford to do is to let her get too close; he could end up in jail, which holds terrors enough; but even more scary, he could end up in love.<br /><br />Honesty is a virtue. Deceit is a talent. Theft is an art form.<br /><br /><i>The Sacred Art Of Stealing</i>: prepare to be misled.",

Cain, the son of Eve and the new chairman of the Vampire Council is amassing an army of creatures like no one has ever seen before. But while a band of human scientists are conducting secret experiments they open the dimension that holds Cain and he is released into the human world, bigger and badder than ever. Her family slaughtered, Damali heads for hell to serve justice and faces off with a nemisis the likes of which she has never encountered. Carlos doesn't take his wife's disappearance lightly and races against time to get Damali back... only to learn that his wife might be pregnant. The question: is the child his or the Chairman's?",

There exists a secret band of brothers like no other-six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. Possessed by a deadly beast, Rhage is the most dangerous of the Black Dagger Brotherhood.</b><br /><br />Within the brotherhood, Rhage is the vampire with the strongest appetites. He's the best fighter, the quickest to act on his impulses, and the most voracious lover-for inside him burns a ferocious curse cast by the Scribe Virgin. Owned by this dark side, Rhage fears the time when his inner dragon is unleashed, making him a danger to everyone around him.<br /><br />Mary Luce, a survivor of many hardships is unwittingly thrown into the vampire world and reliant on Rhage's protection. With a life-threatening curse of her own, Mary is not looking for love. She lost her faith in miracles years ago. But when Rhage's intense animal attraction turns into something more emotional, he knows that he must make Mary his alone. And while their enemies close in, Mary fights desperately to gain life eternal with the one she loves...",

    "description": "Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmare vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life--the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language--and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.",

And gazing mesmerized at the merciless slash of his mouth, the implacable resolve on his face, the soulless emptiness of his black eyes, Tempest was afraid to ask what it was.<br /><br />She had always been different, apart from others. From the moment his arms closed around her, enveloping her in a sorcerer's spell, Darius seemed to understand her unique gifts. But did his kiss offer the love and belonging she sought, or a danger more potent than his own panthers?<br /><br />Somewhere deep inside herself, Tempest, realized she knew the answer. She had no choice but to accept the velvet stroke of his tongue, 'submit to the white-hot heat piercing her skin, welcome an erotic pleasure like no other. . . .",

    "description": "Hailed as the \"king of sleaze,\" tabloid editor Dennis Luxford is used to ferreting out the sins and scandals of people in exposed positions. But when he opens an innocuous-looking letter addressed to him at <i>The Source, </i>he discovers that someone else excels at ferreting out secrets as well.<br /><br />Ten-year-old Charlotte Bowen has been abducted, and if Luxford does not admit publicly to having fathered her, she will die. But Charlotte's existence is Luxford's most fiercely guarded secret, and acknowledging her as his child will throw more than one life and career into chaos. Luxford knows that the story of Charlotte's paternity could make him a laughingstock and reveal to his beautiful wife and son the lie he's lived for a decade. Yet it's not only Luxford's reputation that's on the line: it's also the reputation\u2014and career\u2014of Charlotte Bowen's mother. For she is Undersecretary of State for the Home Office, one of the most high-profile Junior Ministers and quite possibly the next Margaret Thatcher.<br /><br />Knowing that her political future hangs in the balance, Eve Bowen refuses to let Luxford damage her career by printing the story or calling the police. So the editor turns to forensic scientist Simon St. James for help. It's a case that fills St. James with disquiet, however, for none of the players in the drama seem to react the way one would expect.<br /><br />Then tragedy occurs and New Scotland Yard becomes involved. Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley soon discovers that the case sends tentacles from London into the countryside, and he must simultaneously outfox death as he probes Charlotte Bowen's mysterious disappearance. Meanwhile, his partner Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, working part of the investigation on her own and hoping to make the coup of her career, may be drawing closer to a grim solution\u2014and to danger\u2014than anyone knows.<br /><br /><b>In the Presence of the Enemy</b> is a brilliantly insightful and haunting novel of ideals corrupted by self-interest, of the sins of parents visited upon children, and of the masks that hide people from each other\u2014and from themselves.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Paperback edition.</i>",

    "description": "Jason Tavener woke up one morning to find himself completely unknown. The night before he had been the top-rated television star with millions of devoted watchers. The next day he was just an unidentified walking object, whose face nobody recognised, of whom no one had heard, and without the I.D. papers required in that near future.<br /><br />When he finally found a man who would agree to counterfeiting such cards for him, that man turned out to be a police informer. And then Taverner found out not only what it was like to be a nobody but also to be hunted by the whole apparatus of society.<br /><br />It was obvious that in some way Taverner had become the pea in in some sort of cosmic shell game - but how? And why?<br /><br />Philip K. Dick takes the reader on a walking tour of solipsism's scariest margin in his latest novel about the age we are already half into.",

Not only does she have a less-than-satisfying relationship with her boring and cantankerous boyfriend, who has a host of other insecurities, but now her eccentric magazine editor has made her the personal ghostwriter for the towns latest bedazzling, blonde, and busty socialite: Champagne D'Vyne. While Jane reels from the annoying and distasteful business of investigating, and then glamorizing, the vacuous details of Champagne's life, her new assignment suddenly becomes intertwined with her personal life in surprising ways. Will her own romantic prospects broaden? Will she be able to help save her best friend's dilapidated country manor with a matchmaking scheme? At once whimsical and satirical, Simply Divine is already a smash hit in England, and will undoubtedly be a crowd-pleaser for American readers.",

Forced to leave the comfortable home of her childhood, she is sent to London to live with relatives she never met: Aunt Margaret, beautiful and speechless, and her brothers, Francie, whose graceful music belies his clumsy nature, and the volatile Finn, who kisses Melanie in the ruins of the pleasure garden. And brooding Uncle Philip loves only the life-sized wooden puppets he creates in his toyshops. The classic gothic novel established Angela Carter as one of our most imaginative writers and augurs the themes of her later creative works. <br /><br />\"Beneath its contemporary surface, this novel shimmers with blurred echoes\u2014from Lewis Carroll, from 'Giselle' and 'Coppelia,' Harlequin and Punch\u2026 It leave behind it a flavor, pungent and unsettling\" \u2014<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>",

    "description": "The narrator of <i>The Seas</i> lives in a tiny, remote, alcoholic, cruel seaside town. An occasional chambermaid, granddaughter to a typesetter, and daughter to a dead man, awkward and brave, wayward and willful, she is in love (unrequited) with an Iraq War veteran thirteen years her senior. She is convinced that she is a mermaid. What she does to ease the pain of growing up lands her in prison. What she does to get out is the stuff of legend. In the words of writer Michelle Tea, <i>The Seas</i> is \"creepy and poetic, subversive and strangely funny, [and] a phenomenal piece of literature.\"",

    "description": "Back on the job after an involuntary leave of absence, LAPD homicide detective Harry Bosch is ready for a challenge. But his first case is a little more than he bargained for. <br /><br /><br /> It starts with the body of a Hollywood producer in the trunk of a Rolls-Royce, shot twice in the head at close range - what looks like \"trunk music,\" a Mafia hit. But the LAPD's organized crime unit is curiously uninterested, and when Harry follows a trail of gambling debts to Las Vegas, the case suddenly becomes more complex - and much more personal. <br /><br /><br /> A rekindled romance with an old girlfriend opens new perspectives on the murder, and he begins to glimpse a shocking triangle of corruption and collusion. Yanked off the case, Harry himself is soon the one being investigated. But only a bullet can stop Harry when he's searching for the truth . . .",

To this town there comes one day one of the reckless sociopaths who wander the West to kill and rape and pillage. By the time he is through and has ridden off, Hard Times is a smoking ruin. The de facto mayor, Blue, takes in two survivors of the carnage\u2013a boy, Jimmy, and a prostitute, Molly, who has suffered unspeakably\u2013and makes them his provisional family. Blue begins to rebuild Hard Times, welcoming new settlers, while Molly waits with vengeance in her heart for the return of the outlaw. Here is E. L. Doctorow\u2019s debut novel, a searing allegory of frontier life that sets the stage for his subsequent classics.",

    "description": "<b>FROM THE BOOK</b>:\"The pit I was ordered to dig had the precise dimensions of a casket. The NKVD officer carefully designed it. He measured my size with a stick, made lines on the forest floor, and told me to dig. He wanted to make sure I'd fit well inside.\"<br /><br />In 1941 Janusz Bardach's death sentence was commuted to ten years' hard labor and he was sent to Kolyma\u2014the harshest, coldest, and most deadly prison in Joseph Stalin's labor camp system\u2014the Siberia of Siberias. The only English-language memoir since the fall of communism to chronicle the atrocities committed during the Stalinist regime, Bardach's gripping testimony explores the darkest corners of the human condition at the same time that it documents the tyranny of Stalin's reign, equal only to that of Hitler. With breathtaking immediacy, a riveting eye for detail, and a humanity that permeates the events and landscapes he describes, Bardach recounts the extraordinary story of this nearly inconceivable world.<br /><br />The story begins with the Nazi occupation when Bardach, a young Polish Jew inspired by Soviet Communism, crosses the border of Poland to join the ranks of the Red Army. His ideals are quickly shattered when he is arrested, court-martialed, and sentenced to death. How Bardach survives an endless barrage of brutality\u2014from a near-fatal beating to the harsh conditions and slow starvation of the gulag existence\u2014is a testament to human endurance under the most oppressive circumstances. Besides being of great historical significance, Bardach's narrative is a celebration of life and a vital affirmation of what it means to be human.",

    "description": "\"The hour of capitalism's greatest triumph,\" writes Hernando de Soto, \"is, in the eyes of four-fifths of humanity, its hour of crisis.\" In The Mystery of Capital, the world-famous Peruvian economist takes up the question that, more than any other, is central to one of the most crucial problems the world faces today: Why do some countries succeed at capitalism while others fail?In strong opposition to the popular view that success is determined by cultural differences, de Soto finds that it actually has everything to do with the legal structure of property and property rights. Every developed nation in the world at one time went through the transformation from predominantly informal, extralegal ownership to a formal, unified legal property system. In the West we've forgotten that creating this system is also what allowed people everywhere to leverage property into wealth. This persuasive book will revolutionize our understanding of capital and point the way to a major transformation of the world economy.",

    "description": "Blithely flinging aside the Victorian manners that kept her disapproving mother corseted, the New Woman of the 1920s puffed cigarettes, snuck gin, hiked her hemlines, danced the Charleston, and necked in roadsters. More important, she earned her own keep, controlled her own destiny, and secured liberties that modern women take for granted. Her newfound freedom heralded a radical change in American culture.<br /><br />Whisking us from the Alabama country club where Zelda Sayre first caught the eye of F. Scott Fitzgerald to Muncie, Indiana, where would-be flappers begged their mothers for silk stockings, to the Manhattan speakeasies where patrons partied till daybreak, historian Joshua Zeitz brings the era to exhilarating life. This is the story of America\u2019s first sexual revolution, its first merchants of cool, its first celebrities, and its most sparkling advertisement for the right to pursue happiness.<br /><br />The men and women who made the flapper were a diverse lot. <br /><br />There was Coco Chanel, the French orphan who redefined the feminine form and silhouette, helping to free women from the torturous corsets and crinolines that had served as tools of social control. <br /><br />Three thousand miles away, Lois Long, the daughter of a Connecticut clergyman, christened herself \u201cLipstick\u201d and gave New Yorker readers a thrilling entr\u00e9e into Manhattan\u2019s extravagant Jazz Age nightlife.<br /><br />In California, where orange groves gave way to studio lots and fairytale mansions, three of America\u2019s first celebrities\u2014Clara Bow, Colleen Moore, and Louise Brooks, Hollywood\u2019s great flapper triumvirate\u2014fired the imaginations of millions of filmgoers.<br /><br />Dallas-born fashion artist Gordon Conway and Utah-born cartoonist John Held crafted magazine covers that captured the electricity of the social revolution sweeping the United States.<br /><br />Bruce Barton and Edward Bernays, pioneers of advertising and public relations, taught big business how to harness the dreams and anxieties of a newly industrial America\u2014and a nation of consumers was born.<br /><br />Towering above all were Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald, whose swift ascent and spectacular fall embodied the glamour and excess of the era that would come to an abrupt end on Black Tuesday, when the stock market collapsed and rendered the age of abundance and frivolity instantly obsolete.<br /><br />With its heady cocktail of storytelling and big ideas, <i>Flapper</i> is a dazzling look at the women who launched the first truly modern decade.",

    "description": "<b>Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time</b><br /><br />Ralph Elllison's <b>Invisible Man</b> is a monumental novel, one that can well be called an epic of modern American Negro life. It is a strange story, in which many extraordinary things happen, some of them shocking and brutal, some of them pitiful and touching--yet always with elements of comedy and irony and burlesque that appear in unexpected places. It is a book that has a great deal to say and which is destined to have a great deal said about it.<br /><br /> After a brief prologue, the story begins with a terrifying experience of the hero's high school days, moves quickly to the campus of a Southern Negro college and then to New York's Harlem, where most of the action takes place. The many people that the hero meets in the course of his wanderings are remarkably various, complex and significant. With them he becomes involved in an amazing series of adventures, in which he is sometimes befriended but more often deceived and betrayed--as much by himself and his own illusions as by the duplicity of the blindness of others. <br /><br /><b>Invisible Man </b>is not only a great triumph of storytelling and characterization; it is a profound and uncompromising interpretation of the Negro's anomalous position in American society.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "In its concentration of interest upon the protagonists, Macbeth can be seen as Shakespeare's experiment in unity of focus, whose chief appeal arises from the struggles of the central characters with each other and with the infernal powers that inspire or govern them. Over the centuries, the vision of directors like Welles, Nunn and Polanski, as well as the eloquent talents of actors like Garrick, Siddons, Olivier and McKellen have contributed to the central debate of the play: Who or what is culpable? Bernice W. Kliman, in her analysis of Macbeth in performance, examines major productions of the play on both stage and screen, thereby inviting the reader to contemplate directors' and actors' choices for what is arguably Shakespeare's most compelling play.",

Discover (and spell) such wonderfully Seussian creations as the Yuzz-a-ma-Tuzz and the High Gargel-orum.

Ms. Finney wasn't like the other teachers, and she was helping Marcy feel good about being herself.<br />Now that she's gone, Marcy doesn't know what to do.

She decides to join the fight to bring back her teacher, and in doing so, she discovers that her voice might matter more than she ever realized.",

    "description": "Dickens considered <i>Great Expectations</i> one of his \"little pieces\". It is slim compared to such weighty novels as <i>David Copperfield</i> or <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>. But what this cautionary tale of a young man raised high above his station by a mysterious benefactor lacks in length, it more than makes up for in its remarkable characters &amp; compelling story. The novel begins with young orphaned Philip Pirrip--Pip--running afoul of an escaped convict in a cemetery. This terrifying personage bullies Pip into stealing food &amp; a file for him, threatening that if he tells a soul \"your heart &amp; your liver shall be tore out, roasted &amp; ate.\" The boy does as he's asked, but the convict is captured anyway, transported to the penal colonies in Australia. Having started his novel in a cemetery, Dickens then ups the stakes &amp; introduces his hero into the decaying household of Miss Havisham, a wealthy, half-mad woman who was jilted on her wedding day many years before &amp; has never recovered. Pip is brought there to play with Miss Havisham's ward, Estella, a little girl who delights in tormenting Pip about his rough hands &amp; future as a blacksmith's apprentice. <blockquote> I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began to consider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so strong, that it became infectious, &amp; I caught it.</blockquote> It is an infection that Pip never quite recovers from; as he spends more time with Miss Havisham &amp; the tantalizing Estella, he becomes ever more discontented with his guardian, the kindhearted blacksmith, Joe, &amp; his childhood friend Biddy. When, after several years, Pip becomes the heir of an unknown benefactor, he leaps at the chance to leave his home &amp; friends behind to go to London &amp; become a gentleman. But having expectations, as Pip soon learns, is a two-edged sword, &amp; nothing is as he thought it would be. Like that other \"little piece,\" <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, <i>Great Expectations</i> is different from the usual Dickensian fare: the story is dark, almost surreal at times. You'll find few of the author's patented comic characters &amp; no comic set pieces. Yet this is arguably the most compelling of his novels for, unlike David Copperfield or Martin Chuzzlewit, the reader can never be sure that things will work out for Pip. Even Dickens apparently had his doubts--he wrote two endings for this novel.--Alix Wilber",

    "description": "Meet the residents of the London brownstone on 31 Almanac Road who together weave a tangled web of romance. Ralph, a ne'er-do-well artist, suddenly realizes he's head over heels in love with his new flatmate Jem, the most fun and sensible girl he's ever encountered. Unfortunately, Ralph's best friend, Smith, has already won Jem's affections, although Smith has not entirely given up his passion for the femme fatale, Cheri, who lives upstairs. Across the hall, Karl and Siobhan have been happily unmarried for years, until Karl gets a smashing job as a London rush-hour DJ and momentarily gets tempted into Cheri's cozy lair. <br />These six star-crossed tenants become more enamored, and more confused, as the story progresses-until their true destinies are revealed on one crucial night-the evening of the extravaganza that is . . . Ralph's party. This wonderfully hip new novel was an instant popular success when it was first published in England, and American readers are sure to be captivated by the debut of a talented new writer.",

    "description": "It's the 1980s and the rock landscape is littered with massive hair, synthesizers, and monster riffs, but there is an alternative being born in the sleepy East of America-we just don't know it yet.<br />Before the Internet, MTV, and iPods provided far-off music fans with information and communities-and before Nirvana-kids across the world grew up in relative isolation, dependent on mix tapes and self-created art to slowly spread scenes and trends. It was under these conditions that four young musicians found one another in Boston, Massachusetts, and started a band called Pixies.<br />During their initial seven-year career, Pixies would play some of Europe's most gigantic festivals, keep the press guessing, and cultivate a fervid international fan base hungry for more and more of their unique surf punk. The band worked fast, cranking out four albums at a breakneck pace, but ultimately pressures and personality clashes took their toll: Pixies broke up just as bands were singing their praises as <i>the</i> rock'n'roll innovators. <br />For twelve years, a Pixies reunion seemed impossible, but a sudden announcement in 2004 proclaimed the unthinkable-Pixies were getting back together. Their extremely successful reunion tour finally gave the group something they'd always lacked in their homeland: proof that their bone-rattling music had left an indelible impact. <br /><i>Fool the World</i> tells Pixies' story in the words of those who lived it, from the band members to studio owners, from A&amp;R executives, producers, and visual artists who worked with them to admirers of their music, such as Bono, PJ Harvey, Beck, and Perry Farrell. With new cartoons by <i>Trompe Le Monde</i> illustrator Steven Appleby, <i>Fool the World</i> is a complete journey through the life, death, and rebirth of one of the most influential bands of all time.",

They're standing on the toilets, still, hiding until the museum closes and their adventure begins. Such is the impact of timeless novels . . . they never leave us. <br /><i>E. L. Konigsburg</i> won the 1967 Newbery Medal for this tale of how Claudia and her brother run away to the museum in order to teach their parents a lesson. Little do they know that mystery awaits!",

    "description": "In this eagerly awaited new novel, Lionel Shriver, the Orange Prize-winning author of the international bestseller We Need to Talk About Kevin, delivers an imaginative and entertaining look at the implications, large and small, of whom we choose to love. Using a playful parallel-universe structure, The Post-Birthday World follows one woman's future as it unfolds under the influence of two drastically different men.<br /><br />Children's book illustrator Irina McGovern enjoys a quiet and settled life in London with her partner, fellow American expatriate Lawrence Trainer, a smart, loyal, disciplined intellectual at a prestigious think tank. To their small circle of friends, their relationship is rock solid. Until the night Irina unaccountably finds herself dying to kiss another man: their old friend from South London, the stylish, extravagant, passionate top-ranking snooker player Ramsey Acton. The decision to give in to temptation will have consequences for her career, her relationships with family and friends, and perhaps most importantly the texture of her daily life.<br /><br />Hinging on a single kiss, this enchanting work of fiction depicts Irina's alternating futures with two men temperamentally worlds apart yet equally honorable. With which true love Irina is better off is neither obvious nor easy to determine, but Shriver's exploration of the two destinies is memorable and gripping. Poignant and deeply honest, written with the subtlety and wit that are the hallmarks of Shriver's work, The Post-Birthday World appeals to the what-if in us all.<br />(jacket)",

    "description": "On his long journey home from the Third Crusade, Richard the Lionheart--one of history's most powerful and romantic figures--was ship-wrecked near Venice in the Adriatic Sea. Forced to make his way home by land through enemy countries, he traveled in disguise, but was eventually captured by Duke Leopold V of Austria, who in turn conveyed him to Henry VI, the Holy Roman Emperor. Henry demanded a majestic ransom, and Richard's mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, raised the historic sum--one quarter of the entire wealth of England--and Richard was returned. But a peculiar legend followed him--that a troubadour named Blondel, a friend of Richard's, had journeyed across Europe singing a song he knew Richard would recognize in order to discover his secret place of imprisonment.<br /><br />David Boyle recreates the drama of the Third Crusade and the dynamic power politics and personalities of the late 12th century in Europe, as well as the growing fascination with romance and chivalry embodied in the troubadour culture. An evocation of a pivotal era, <i>The Troubadour's Song</i> is narrative history at its finest.",

    "description": "<i>Plan of Attack</i> is the definitive account of how and why President George W. Bush, his war council, and allies launched a preemptive attack to topple Saddam Hussein and occupy Iraq. Bob Woodward's latest landmark account of Washington decision making provides an original, authoritative narrative of behind-the-scenes maneuvering over two years, examining the causes and consequences of the most controversial war since Vietnam. <br /> Based on interviews with 75 key participants and more than three and a half hours of exclusive interviews with President Bush, <i>Plan of Attack</i> is part presidential history charting the decisions made during 16 critical months; part military history revealing precise details and the evolution of the Top Secret war planning under the restricted codeword Polo Step; and part a harrowing spy story as the CIA dispatches a covert paramilitary team into northern Iraq six months before the start of the war. This team recruited 87 Iraqi spies designated with the cryptonym DB/ROCKSTARS, one of whom turned over the personnel files of all 6,000 men in Saddam Hussein's personal security organization. <br /> What emerges are astonishingly intimate portraits: President Bush in war cabinet meetings in the White House Situation Room and the Oval Office, and in private conversation; Dick Cheney, the focused and driven vice president; Colin Powell, the conflicted and cautious secretary of state; Donald Rumsfeld, the controlling war technocrat; George Tenet, the activist CIA director; Tommy Franks, the profane and demanding general; Condoleezza Rice, the ever-present referee and national security adviser; Karl Rove, the hands-on political strategist; other key members of the White House staff and congressional leadership; and foreign leaders ranging from British Prime Minister Blair to Russian President Putin. <br /><i>Plan of Attack</i> provides new details on the intelligence assessments of Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction and the planning for the war's aftermath.",

    "description": "Separated by a decade and 200 points on their SAT scores, Jack and Connor Reed have a life in the Cleveland suburbs held together by spit and Chinese takeout. With his self-absorbed, over-the-hill parents dead by his twenty-fifth birthday, Jack has abandoned his own plans and returned to his parents\u2019 house where he works marathon hours at his late father\u2019s law firm, beds young paralegals, and throws money and advice at his teenage brother. Connor meanwhile wants nothing more than to leave the Midwest, start a family early, and do everything the way his parents didn\u2019t. But over the years, through the car crashes and bad breakups, the illnesses and illicit affairs, both realize that while circumstances are sometimes beyond control, there are always choices to be made. <br /><br /><i>Family and Other Accidents</i> tells the story of these brothers from their viewpoints as well as from those of their girlfriends, wives, and children. It is a story of what it means to be a family, to love unconditionally in the face of confusion, anger, and regret. Shari Goldhagen\u2019s debut is a finely nuanced, universally resonant portrait of the ties, however strange or awkward, that bind families together through the decades.",

    "description": "One day I blew my nose and half my brains came out.\" Los Angeles, 1976. David Bowie is holed up in his Bel-Air mansion, drifting into drug-induced paranoia and confusion. Obsessed with black magic and the Holy Grail, he's built an altar in the living room and keeps his fingernail clippings in the fridge. There are occasional trips out to visit his friend Iggy Pop in a mental institution. His latest album is the cocaine-fuelled Station To Station (Bowie: \"I know it was recorded in LA because I read it was\"), which welds R&amp;B rhythms to lyrics that mix the occult with a yearning for Europe, after three mad years in the New World. Bowie has long been haunted by the angst-ridden, emotional work of the Die Brucke movement and the Expressionists. Berlin is their spiritual home, and after a chaotic world tour, Bowie adopts this city as his new sanctuary. Immediately he sets to work on Low, his own expressionist mood-piece.",

Multiply that a couple of hundred times and you generate a healthy flow of checks, week in, week out. Between fake choking gigs, Victor works at Colonial Dunsboro with a motley group of losers and stoners trapped in 1734, cruises sex addiction groups for action (\"You put twenty sexaholics around a table night after night and don't be surprised.\"), and visits his mother, whose anarchic streak made his childhood a mad whirl and whose Alzheimer's disease now hides what may be the startling truth about his (possibly divine?) parentage. An antihero for our deranging times, Victor's whole existence is a struggle to wrest an identity from overwhelming forces. His creator, Chuck Palahniuk, is the visionary we need and the satirist we deserve.",

    "description": "In myth, Theseus was the slayer of the child-devouring Minotaur in Crete. What the founder-hero might have been in real life is another question, brilliantly explored in <i>The King Must Die</i>. Drawing on modern scholarship and archaeological findings at Knossos, Mary Renault\u2019s Theseus is an utterly lifelike figure\u2014a king of immense charisma, whose boundless strivings flow from strength <i>and</i> weakness\u2014but also one steered by implacable prophecy.<br /><br />The story follows Theseus\u2019s adventures from Troizen to Eleusis, where the death in the book\u2019s title is to take place, and from Athens to Crete, where he learns to jump bulls and is named king of the victims. Richly imbued with the spirit of its time, this is a page-turner as well as a daring act of imagination.",

She's never faced a situation she couldn't comment about -- especialy online! She lives in Chicago with her husband, LT, and her large cat, The Cat -- not to be confused with Kat (female friend, good for fashion advice, philosophical discussions, and getting into trouble in bars). She's never had a cavity and likes to look in other people's medicine cabinets. She's witty, urbane, outrageous, an international sensation; she's got a unique, smartypants take on ordinary life and its rampant surreality. And absolutely <em>nothing</em> is sacred or taboo -- not men, marriage, beer, religion, sex, marital aids, or motherhood.<br /><br />Get ready world -- because Mimi's going to explain it <em>all</em> to you!",

          "description": "The Lewis Barnavelt series of adventures was created by John Bellairs, starting with the award-winning 1973 book The House with a Clock in its Walls. Bellairs quickly followed up with two adventures in the series starring Lewis (The Figure in the Shadows; 1975) and his friend Rose Rita Pottinger (The Letter, the Witch, and the Ring; 1976). \n    \n    The series was dormant during the 1980s as Bellairs focused his books on the escapades of Johnny Dixon but was on the verge of a comeback when Bellairs died in 1991. Author Brad Strickland was commissioned to complete the two book Bellairs had begun prior to his death \u2013 The Ghost in the Mirror and The Vengeance of the Witch-finder \u2013 as well as construct a novel from Bellairs\u2019 scant notes, which would evolve into The Doom of the Haunted Opera.\n    \n    In 1998 Dial published The Specter from the Magician's Museum, the first in the Barnavelt series to have been written entirely by Strickland. As of 2008, the 12-book series is still in production with The Sign of the Sinister Sorcerer the most recent title.\n    \n    When the Barnavelt series was translated into French in 2001, the publisher changed Lewis\u2019s name to K\u00e9vin and Rose Rita\u2019s to Emily \u2013 \"to give the books a more American feel to French readers,\" according to French illustrator Lalex.",

    "description": "In the period between 1200 and 1500 in western Europe, a number of religious women gained widespread veneration and even canonization as saints for their extraordinary devotion to the Christian eucharist, supernatural multiplications of food and drink, and miracles of bodily manipulation, including stigmata and inedia (living without eating). The occurrence of such phenomena sheds much light on the nature of medieval society and medieval religion. It also forms a chapter in the history of women. <br /><br />Previous scholars have occasionally noted the various phenomena in isolation from each other and have sometimes applied modern medical or psychological theories to them. Using materials based on saints' lives and the religious and mystical writings of medieval women and men, Caroline Walker Bynum uncovers the pattern lying behind these aspects of women's religiosity and behind the fascination men and women felt for such miracles and devotional practices. She argues that food lies at the heart of much of women's piety. Women renounced ordinary food through fasting in order to prepare for receiving extraordinary food in the eucharist. They also offered themselves as food in miracles of feeding and bodily manipulation. <br /><br />Providing both functionalist and phenomenological explanations, Bynum explores the ways in which food practices enabled women to exert control within the family and to define their religious vocations. She also describes what women meant by seeing their own bodies and God's body as food and what men meant when they too associated women with food and flesh. The author's interpretation of women's piety offers a new view of the nature of medieval asceticism and, drawing upon both anthropology and feminist theory, she illuminates the distinctive features of women's use of symbols. Rejecting presentist interpretations of women as exploited or masochistic, she shows the power and creativity of women's writing and women's lives.",

    "description": "A direct and fundamentally optimistic indictment of the short-sightedness and intellectual arrogance that has characterized much of urban planning in this century, <i>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</i> has, since its first publication in 1961, become the standard against which all endeavors in that field are measured. In prose of outstanding immediacy, Jane Jacobs writes about what makes streets safe or unsafe; about what constitutes a neighborhood, and what function it serves within the larger organism of the city; about why some neighborhoods remain impoverished while others regenerate themselves. She writes about the salutary role of funeral parlors and tenement windows, the dangers of too much development money and too little diversity. Compassionate, bracingly indignant, and always keenly detailed, Jane Jacobs's monumental work provides an essential framework for assessing the vitality of all cities.",

    "description": "The story's protagonist, Jude Fawley, is a working-class young man, a stonemason, who dreams of becoming a scholar. The other main character is his cousin, Sue Bridehead, who is also his central love interest. The novel is concerned in particular with issues of class, education, religion and marriage. There's a tale that goes around even now regarding Thomas Hardy - that is, that the reaction of readers to one of his novels was so intense - and so disturbing! - that he swore off novels and spent the rest of his life committing poetry. Well, the story is true, the way it happens, and this is the book responsible: <i>Jude the Obscure</i>.",

    "description": "Here is the highly anticipated second installment of Philip Pullman's epic fantasy trilogy, begun with the critically acclaimed \"The Golden Compass.\" Lyra and Will, her newfound friend, tumble separately into the strange tropical otherworld of Cittagazze, \"the city of magpies,\" where adults are curiously absent and children run wild. Here their lives become inextricably entwined when Lyra's alethiometer gives her a simple command: find Will's father. Their search is plagued with obstacles--some familiar and some horribly new and unfathomable--but it eventually brings them closer to Will's father and to the Subtle Knife, a deadly, magical, ancient tool that cuts windows between worlds. Through it all, Will and Lyra find themselves hurtling toward the center of a fierce battle against a force so awesome that leagues of mortals, witches, beasts, and spirits from every world are uniting in fear and anger against it. This breathtaking sequel will leave readers eager for the third and final volume of \"His Dark Materials.\"",

    "description": "Jean is on her way to Hawaii for a week of fun but the vacation gets off to a gruesome start. The boy beside her on the plane chokes and dies. Jean tries to push the incident out of her mind when she arrives on the island but it's impossible. Part of the reason is because Mike keeps coming back to her in dreams; horrible dreams filled with blood.<br /><br />Two of Jean's friends are awaiting her in Hawaii - Mandy and Michele. They have already made friends with two young men who teach scuba diving at the hotel, Dave and Johnny. Jean and Johnny quickly become friends but there are problems in paradise. Dave and Johnny have recently lost a partner in the ocean. No one knows how he died. No one can find his body. Then Jean does. It isn't where it's supposed to be and seems to have some life in it!",

In small groups, and with the help of cleverly planted clues, the kids are led throughout the city, and then deep into a nighttime desert. The sponsoring club has promised a wonderful prize for the first group to reach the goal of the hunt. But for Carl Timmons, a troubled young man who has recently lost his best friend, the hunt will become a nightmare. Led astray by his love for a strangely beautiful girl, he will wander far from the others, and back into a haunted past, where the line between hte living and the dead is blurred and broken.",

    "description": "<b>Pulitzer Prize Finalist</b><br /><b>Anisfield-Wolf Award Winner</b><br /><br />Over a frigid few weeks in the winter of 1741, ten fires blazed across Manhattan. With each new fire, panicked whites saw more evidence of a slave uprising. In the end, thirteen black men were burned at the stake, seventeen were hanged and more than one hundred black men and women were thrown into a dungeon beneath City Hall. <br /><br />In <i>New York Burning</i>,<i> </i>Bancroft Prize-winning historian Jill Lepore recounts these dramatic events, re-creating, with path-breaking research, the nascent New York of the seventeenth century. Even then, the city was a rich mosaic of cultures, communities and colors, with slaves making up a full one-fifth of the population. Exploring the political and social climate of the times, Lepore dramatically shows how, in a city rife with state intrigue and terror, the threat of black rebellion united the white political pluralities in a frenzy of racial fear and violence.",

    "description": "<blockquote>\"Your talent determines what you can do. Your motivation determines how much you are willing to do. Your attitude determines how well you do it.\"-- Lou Holtz<br /></blockquote>Meet Lou Holtz, the motivational miracle worker who revitalized the Notre Dame football program by leading the legendary Fighting Irish to nine bowl games and a national championship. During his twenty-seven years as a head football coach, Holtz garnered a 216-95-7 career record. Each new assignment brought a different team with different players, but, invariably, the same result--success. How did he do it? By designing a game plan for his players that minimized obstacles while maximizing opportunities.<br /><br />Now he wants to pass his game plan on to you. In <em>Winning Every Day,</em> you'll discover ten strategies that will drive you to the top of your professional and personal life. Coach Holtz will reveal how you can acquire the focus and commitment it takes to be a champion. It won't be easy; it takes sacrifice to be the best. But now you'll have a proven winner alongside you in the trenches. <em>Winning Every Day</em> demonstrates how you can elevate your performance while raising the standards of everyone around you. Follow Coach's strategies and winning becomes habitual. You will learn to welcome sacrifice as you dedicate yourself to excellence. He will show you how to clearly define your short-term and long-term goals, to develop an unwavering sense of purpose without compromising flexibility.<br /><br />Through it all, Coach Holtz will help you discover the courage you need to live a life of unremitting triumph. You couldn't have a better guide. He will provide you with the strategies he has shared with Fortune 500 companies, groups, and organizations. Voted the top motivational speaker two years running by a survey of speakers' bureaus, Coach is going to present you with all the Xs and Os, the basics of his game plan for success in life and business.<br /><br /><br /><br />",

From his vantage point at the break-up of the old regime, Kapuscinski gives us a compelling history of conspiracy, repression, fanatacism, and revolution.",

    "description": "With this dizzyingly rich novel of ideas, Thomas Mann rose to the front ranks of the great modern novelists, winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1929. <i>The Magic Mountain</i> takes place in an exclusive tuberculosis sanatorium in the Swiss Alps\u2013a community devoted to sickness that serves as a fictional microcosm for Europe in the days before the First World War. To this hermetic and otherworldly realm comes Hans Castorp, an \u201cordinary young man\u201d who arrives for a short visit and ends up staying for seven years, during which he succumbs both to the lure of eros and to the intoxication of ideas.<br /><br />\u00a0Acclaimed translator John E. Woods has given us the definitive English version of Mann\u2019s masterpiece. A monumental work of erudition and irony, sexual tension and intellectual ferment, <i>The Magic Mountain</i> is an enduring classic.<br /><br />(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed)<br /><br />",

In this truly indispensable book, Dietrich D\u00f6rner identifies what he calls the \u201clogic of failure\u201d\u2014certain tendencies in our patterns of thought that, while appropriate to an older, simpler world, prove disastrous for the complex world we live in now. Working with imaginative and often hilarious computer simulations, he analyzes the roots of catastrophe, showing city planners in the very act of creating gridlock and disaster, or public health authorities setting the scene for starvation. <i>The Logic of Failure</i> is a compass for intelligent planning and decision-making that can sharpen the skills of managers, policymakers and everyone involved in the daily challenge of getting from point A to point B.",

    "description": "To this day, the low, thin wail of an infant can be heard in Keldale's lush green valleys. Three hundred years ago, as legend goes, the frightened Yorkshire villagers smothered a crying babe in Keldale Abbey, where they'd hidden to escape the ravages of Cromwell's raiders.<br /><br />Now into Keldale's pastoral web of old houses and older secrets comes Scotland Yard Inspector Thomas Lynley, the eighth earl of Asherton. Along with the redoubtable Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, Lynley has been sent to solve a savage murder that has stunned the peaceful countryside. For fat, unlovely Roberta Teys has been found in her best dress, an axe in her lap, seated in the old stone barn beside her father's headless corpse. Her first and last words were \"I did it. And I'm not sorry.\"<br /><br />Yet as Lynley and Havers wind their way through Keldale's dark labyrinth of secret scandals and appalling crimes, they uncover a shattering series of revelations that will reverberate through this tranquil English valley\u2014and in their own lives as well.",

    "description": "Set against the backdrop of one of the most virulent epidemics that America ever experienced-the 1918 flu epidemic-Thomas Mullen's powerful, sweeping first novel is a tale of morality in a time of upheaval. <br />Deep in the mist-shrouded forests of the Pacific Northwest is a small mill town called Commonwealth, conceived as a haven for workers weary of exploitation. For Philip Worthy, the adopted son of the town's founder, it is a haven in another sense-as the first place in his life he's had a loving family to call his own. <br />And yet, the ideals that define this outpost are being threatened from all sides. A world war is raging, and with the fear of spies rampant, the loyalty of all Americans is coming under scrutiny. Meanwhile, another shadow has fallen across the region in the form of a deadly illness striking down vast swaths of surrounding communities. <br />When Commonwealth votes to quarantine itself against contagion, guards are posted at the single road leading in and out of town, and Philip Worthy is among them. He will be unlucky enough to be on duty when a cold, hungry, tired-and apparently ill-soldier presents himself at the town's doorstep begging for sanctuary. The encounter that ensues, and the shots that are fired, will have deafening reverberations throughout Commonwealth, escalating until every human value-love, patriotism, community, family, friendship-not to mention the town's very survival, is imperiled. <br />Inspired by a little-known historical footnote regarding towns that quarantined themselves during the 1918 epidemic, \"The Last Town on Earth\" is a remarkably moving and accomplished debut.",

Each Upanishad, or lesson, takes up a theme ranging from the attainment of spiritual bliss to karma and rebirth, and collectively they are meditations on life, death and immortality. The essence of their teachings is that truth can by reached by faith rather than by thought, and that the spirit of God is within each of us - we need not fear death as we carry within us the promise of eternal life.",

    "description": "Kahlil Gibran\u2019s masterpiece, The Prophet, is one of the most beloved classics of our time. Published in 1923, it has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American editions alone have sold more than nine million copies.<br /><br />The Prophet is a collection of poetic essays that are philosophical, spiritual, and, above all, inspirational. Gibran\u2019s musings are divided into twenty-eight chapters covering such sprawling topics as love, marriage, children, giving, eating and drinking, work, joy and sorrow, housing, clothes, buying and selling, crime and punishment, laws, freedom, reason and passion, pain, self-knowledge, teaching, friendship, talking, time, good and evil, prayer, pleasure, beauty, religion, and death.<br /><br />Each essay reveals deep insights into the impulses of the human heart and mind. The Chicago Post said of The Prophet: \u201cCadenced and vibrant with feeling, the words of Kahlil Gibran bring to one\u2019s ears the majestic rhythm of Ecclesiastes . . . If there is a man or woman who can read this book without a quiet acceptance of a great man\u2019s philosophy and a singing in the heart as of music born within, that man or woman is indeed dead to life and truth.\u201d<br /><br />With twelve full-page drawings by Gibran, this beautiful work makes an incredible gift for anyone seeking enlightenment and inspiration.",

    "description": "They are full of the perception of life as it is, and the passion for life as it ought to be, which have made <em>The Glass Menagerie</em> and <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em> classics of the American theater.<br /><br /><br />Only one of these plays (<em>The Purification</em>) is written in verse, but in all of them the approach to character is by way of poetic revelation. Whether Williams is writing of derelict roomers in a New Orleans boarding house (<em>The Lady of Larkspur Lotion</em>) or the memories of a venerable traveling salesman (<em>The Last of My Solid Gold Watches</em>) or of delinquent children (<em>This Property is Condemned</em>), his insight into human nature is that of the poet. He can compress the basic meaning of life\u2014its pathos or its tragedy, its bravery or the quality of its love\u2014into one small scene or a few moments of dialogue.<br /><br /><br />Mr. Williams's views on the role of the little theater in American culture are contained in a stimulating essay, \"Something wild...,\" which serves as an introduction to this collection.",

    "description": "<i>Veronica Mars</i> has won the hearts of a small but devoted fanbase drawn to Veronica\u2019s class-torn hometown, where the high school landscape echoes adult patterns of power and privilege, and your best bet for justice is a teenage girl and her private detective father. The show is so snarky, so smart, and so savvy, that the detective show\u2019s biggest mystery is why more people aren\u2019t watching.<br /><br />This collection of essays on the show\u2019s first two seasons explores the noir roots of Veronica\u2019s blond locks, and the sharp writing and killer plot twists that have catapulted Veronica Mars to the top of smart viewers\u2019 must-watch lists.",

    "description": "A man trapped in a millionare's deadly game of political and sexual betrayal. <br /><br />Filled with shocks and chilling surprises, <i>The Magus</i> is a masterwork of contemporary literature. In it, a young Englishman, Nicholas Urfe, accepts a teaching position on a Greek island where his friendship with the owner of the islands most magnificent estate leads him into a nightmare. As reality and fantasy are deliberately confused by staged deaths, erotic encounters, and terrifying violence, Urfe becomes a desperate man fighting for his sanity and his life. A work rich with symbols, conundrums and labrinthine twists of event, <i>The Magus</i> is as thought-provoking as it is entertaining, a work that ranks with the best novels of modern times.",

He was a small man sent to perform a small task.\" <br />Howard Elman is a man whose internal landscape is as disordered as his front yard, where native New Hampshire birches mingle with a bullet-riddled washer, abandoned bathroom fixtures, and several junk cars. Howard, anti-hero of this first novel in Ernest Hebert's highly acclaimed Darby series, is a mixture too. <br />Howard's battle against encroaching change symbolizes the class conflict between indigenous Granite Staters scratching out a living and citified immigrants with \"college degrees and big bank accounts.\" Like the winter-weakened deer threatened by the dogs of March -- the normally docile house pets whose instincts arouse them to chase and kill for sport -- Howard, too, is sorely beset.",

    "description": "<i>Songs of a Dreamer</i> was Thomas Ligotti\u2019s first collection of supernatural horror stories. When originally published in 1985 by Harry Morris\u2019s Silver Scarab Press, the book was hardly noticed. In 1989, an expanded version appeared that garnered accolades from several quarters. Writing in the Washington Post, the celebrated science fiction and fantasy author Michael Swanwick extolled: \u201cPut this volume on the shelf right between H. P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe. Where it belongs.\u201d<br /><br />The revisions in the present volume of Songs of a Dead Dreamer have been calculated to make its stories into enhanced incarnations of the originals. This edition is and will remain definitive.<br /><br />For those already familiar with the stories in Songs of a Dead Dreamer, an invitation is extended to return to them in their ultimate state. For those new to the collection, it is submitted to engage them with some of the most extraordinary tales of their kind. In either case, this publication of Songs of a Dead Dreamer offers evidence for why Ligotti has been judged to be among the most important authors in the history of supernatural horror.",

    "description": "<i>This Side of Paradise,</i> F. Scott Fitzgerald's romantic and witty first novel, was written when the author was only twenty-three years old. This semiautobiographical story of the handsome, indulged, and idealistic Princeton student Amory Blaine received critical raves and catapulted Fitzgerald to instant fame. Now, readers can enjoy the newly edited, authorized version of this early classic of the Jazz Age, based on Fitzgerald's original manuscript. In this definitive text, <i>This Side of Paradise</i> captures the rhythms and romance of Fitzgerald's youth and offers a poignant portrait of the \"Lost Generation.\"",

    "description": "Written by the chief military correspondent of the <i>New York Times </i>and a prominent retired Marine general, this is the definitive account of the invasion of Iraq.A stunning work of investigative journalism, <i>Cobra II </i>describes in riveting detail how the American rush to Baghdad provided the opportunity for the virulent insurgency that followed. As Gordon and Trainor show, the brutal aftermath was not inevitable and was a surprise to the generals on both sides. Based on access to unseen documents and exclusive interviews with the men and women at the heart of the war, <i>Cobra II</i> provides firsthand accounts of the fighting on the ground and the high-level planning behind the scenes. Now with a new afterword that addresses what transpired after the fateful events of the summer of 2003, this is a peerless re-creation and analysis of the central event of our times.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",

The anonymous author depicts her fellow Berliners in all their humanity, as well as their cravenness, corrupted first by hunger and then by the Russians. <em>A Woman in Berlin</em> tells of the complex relationship between civilians and an occupying army and the shameful indignities to which women in a conquered city are always subject--the mass rape suffered by all, regardless of age or infirmity.",

On a downtown sidewalk, Jack Reacher and an unknown woman are abducted in broad daylight by two men - practiced and confident - who stop them at gunpoint and hustle them into the same sedan. Then Reacher and the woman are switched into a second vehicle and hauled away, leaving the dentist bound and gagged inside his car with the woman's abandoned possessions, two gallons of gasoline. . . and a burning match. The FBI is desperate to rescue the woman, a Special Agent from the Chicago office, because the FBI always - always - takes care of its own, and because this woman is not just another agent. Reacher and the woman join forces, against seemingly hopeless odds, to outwit their captors and escape. But the FBI thinks Jack is one of the kidnappers - and when they close in, the Bureau snipers will be shooting to kill.",

She tells us the uncomfortable truth about the way we vote, the candidates we vote for, and the people who tell us to vote for them. These pieces build, one on the other, into a disturbing portrait of the American political landscape, providing essential reading on our democracy.",

Andre Dubus treats his characters--a bereaved father stalking his son's killer; a woman crying alone by her television late at night; a devout teenager writing in the coils of faith and sexuality; a father's story of limitless love for his daughter--with respect and compassion.

In its general theoretical argument on the relations of culture to economy, but also in its specialized concentration, Noise has much that is of importance to critical theory today.\u201d SubStance\u201cFor Attali, music is not simply a reflection of culture, but a harbinger of change, an anticipatory abstraction of the shape of things to come. The book\u2019s title refers specifically to the reception of musics that sonically rival normative social orders. Noise is Attali\u2019s metaphor for a broad, historical vanguardism, for the radical soundscapes of the western continuum that express structurally the course of social development.\u201d EthnomusicologyJacques Attali is the author of numerous books, including Millennium: Winners and Losers in the Coming World Order and Labyrinth in Culture and Society.",

Park\u2019s genius, born into the turmoil of post-war Korea, is used as a puppet by the South Korean government\u2014before being banished to America. From a remote New York city ghetto, the boy wages a clandestine guerilla war against all symbols of authority. Park renders his vision of late-20th-century global culture with the bold, surreal strokes of Pynchon and the wild political sensibilities of Godard; the painful, largely unmapped narrative territory of <i>Boy Genius</i> creates a gripping, harrowing read.<br /><br /><b>Yongsoo Park</b> is a Korean-American writer and independent film-maker living in New York City.<br />",

    "description": "This year's winner of the Yale Series of Younger Poets competition is Maurice Manning's Lawrence Booth's Book of Visions. These compelling poems take us on a wild ride through the life of a man-child in the rural South. Presenting a cast of allegorical, yet very real, characters, the poems have authority, daring, and a language of colour and sure movement, says series judge W.S. Merwin. Maurice Manning is a native of Danville, Kentucky. He holds degrees from Earlham College, the University of Kentucky, and the University of Alabama, where he received his MFA in 1999. He has held a writing fellowship to The Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown. He currently teaches English at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana. From Seven Chimeras The way Booth makes a love story: same as a regular story, except under one rock is a trapdoor that leads to a room full of belly buttons; each must be pushed, one is a landmine. The way Booth makes hope: thirty-seven acres, Black Damon, Red Dog. Construct a pillar of fire in the Great Field and let it become unquenchable. The way Booth ends the Jack-in-the-Box charade: shoot the weasel in the neck and toss it to the buzzards. The way Booth think",

It marked the birth of the modern graphic novel and the beginning of an era when serious cartoonists could be liberated from their stultifying comic-book format.<br /><br />More than a quarter-century after the initial publication of <em>A Contract With God</em>, and in the last few months of his life, Eisner chose to combine the three fictional works he had set on Dropsie Avenue, the mythical street of his youth in Depression-era New York City.<br /><br />As the dramas unfold in <em>A Contract With God</em>, the first book in this new trilogy, it is at 55 Dropsie Avenue where Frimme Hersh, the pious Jew, first loses his beloved daughter, then breaks his contract with his maker, and ends up as a slumlord; it is on Dropsie Avenue where a street singer, befriended by an aging diva, is so beholden to the bottle that he fails to grasp his chance for stardom; and it is there that a scheming little girl named Rosie poisons a depraved super\u2019s dog before doing in the super as well.<br /><br />In the second book, <em>A Life Force</em>, declared by R. Crumb to be \"a masterpiece,\" Eisner re-creates himself in his protagonist, Jacob Shtarkah, whose existential search reflected Eisner\u2019s own lifelong struggle. Chronicling not only the Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression but also the rise of Nazism and the spread of left-wing politics, Eisner combined the miniaturist sensibility of Henry Roth with the grand social themes of novelists such as Dos Passos and Steinbeck.<br /><br />Finally, in <em>Dropsie Avenue: The Neighborhood</em>, Eisner graphically traces the social trajectory of this mythic avenue over four centuries, creating a sweeping panorama of the city and its waves of new residents\u2014the Dutch, English, Irish, Jews, African Americans, and Puerto Ricans\u2014whose faces changed yet whose lives presented an unending \"story of life, death, and resurrection.\"<br /><br />The <em>Contract With God Trilogy</em> is a mesmerizing, fictional chronicle of a universal American experience and Eisner\u2019' most poignant and enduring literary legacy.<br /><br />",

But life was not without its problems - his family often objected to his animal-collecting activities, especially when the beasts wound up in the villa or - even worse - the fridge. \n    \n    With hilarious yet endearing portraits of his family and their many unusual hangers-on, The Corfu Trilogy also captures the beginnings of the author's lifelong love of animals. Recounted with immense humour and charm, this wonderful account of Corfu's natural history reveals a rare, magical childhood.",

    "description": "Winner of the 1973 National Book Award, <i>Gravity\u2019s Rainbow</i> is a postmodern epic, a work as exhaustively significant to the second half of the twentieth century as Joyce\u2019s <i>Ulysses</i> was to the first. Its sprawling, encyclopedic narrative and penetrating analysis of the impact of technology on society make it an intellectual tour de force.<br /><br />Gravity's Rainbow shared the 1974 <i>National Book Award</i> with <b>A Crown of Feathers and Other Stories</b> by Isaac Bashevis Singer (split award). That same year, the Pulitzer Prize fiction panel unanimously recommended <b>Gravity's Rainbow</b> for the award, but the Pulitzer board vetoed the jury's recommendation, describing the novel as \"unreadable\", \"turgid\", \"overwritten\", and in parts \"obscene\". (Kihss 1974) (No <i>Pulitzer Prize for Fiction</i> was awarded and finalists were not announced before 1980.) In 1975, Pynchon declined the <i>William Dean Howells Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Letters</i>.",

    "description": "Jacob Todd is abroad on his own for the first time, visiting his grandfather's grave at the annual commemoration of the Battle of Arnhem in Amsterdam. There, he meets Geertrui, a terminally ill old lady, who tells an extraordinary story of love and betrayal, which completely overturns Jacob's view of himself and his country, and leads him to question his place in the world. Jacob's story is paralled in time by the events of the dramatic day in World War II when retreating troops were sheltered by Geertrui's family.<br /><br />An intensely moving and richly layered novel, spanning 50 years, which powerfully evokes the atmosphere of war while brilliantly interweaving Jacob's exploration of new relationships in contemporary Amsterdam.",

    "description": "Welcome to Bon Temps. It's just your average sleepy backwater town. You know the kind of place...a dime store, a trailer park, a diner, and a gang of newly 'out of the coffin' undead.<br /><br />Sookie Stackhouse is a small-time cocktail waitress in small-town Louisiana. She's quiet, keeps to herself and doesn't get out much. Not because she's not pretty. She is. It's just that, well, Sookie has this sort of 'disability' - she can read minds. And that doesn't make her too dateable. But then along comes Bill. He's tall, dark, handsome - and Sookie can't hear a word he's thinking. He's exactly the type of guy she's been waiting for all her life.<br /><br />But Bill has a problem of his own: he's a vampire. With a bad reputation. He hangs with a seriously creepy crowd, all suspected of - big surprise - murder. And when one of Sookie's co-workers is killed, she fears she's next . . .",

Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli (1469-1527) came to be regarded by some as an agent of the Devil and his name taken for the intriguer 'Machevill' of Jacobean tragedy. For his treatise on statecraft Machiavelli drew upon his own experience of office under the turbulent Florentine republic, rejecting traditional values of political theory and recognising the complicated, transient nature of political life. Concerned not with lofty ideals but with a regime that would last, <i>The Prince</i> has become the bible of realpolitik, and still retains its power to alarm and to instruct.<br /><br />In this edition Machiavelli's tough-minded and pragmatic Italian is preserved in George Bull's clear, unambiguous translation, while Anthony Grafton's introduction depicts Machiavelli's world of power struggles and intrigue, and discusses his role as a political teacher of Europe.",

    "description": "<div>\n  <div>Gaius Petrius Ruso is a divorced and down-on his luck army doctor who has made the rash decision to seek his fortune in an inclement outpost of the Roman Empire, namely Britannia. His arrival in Deva (more commonly known as Chester, England) does little to improve his mood, and after a straight thirty six hour shift at the army hospital, he succumbs to a moment of weakness and rescues an injured slave girl, Tilla, from the hands of her abusive owner.<br /><br />Now he has a new problem: a slave who won't talk and can't cook, and drags trouble in her wake. Before he knows it, Ruso is caught in the middle of an investigation into the deaths of prostitutes working out of the local bar. A few years earlier, after he rescued Emperor Trajan from an earthquake in Antioch, Ruso seemed headed for glory: now he's living among heathens in a vermin-infested bachelor pad and must summon all his forensic knowledge to find a killer who may be after him next. <br /><br />Who are the true barbarians, the conquered or the conquerors? It's up to Ruso\u2014certainly the most likeable sleuth to come out of the Roman Empire\u2014to discover the truth. With a gift for comic timing and historic detail, Ruth Downie has conjured an ancient world as raucous and real as our own.</div>\n  <div> </div>\n  <div>Published in the UK as <i>Medicus (Ruso) and the Disappearing Dancing Girls</i>.</div>\n</div>",

Perhaps most importantly, this novel offers a refreshingly positive picture of an African nation - and probably deserves a wide audience in the West on those grounds alone.\"<br /><br />In 1999 The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency received two Booker Judges' Special Recommendations and was voted one of the \u2018International Books of the Year and the Millennium' by the Times Literary Supplement. <br /><br />Tears of the Giraffe takes us further into the life of the engaging and sassy Precious Ramotswe, the owner and detective of Botswana's only Ladies' detective agency. Among her cases are wayward wives, unscrupulous maids and a challenge to resolve a mother's pain for her son, who is long lost on the African plains. Mma Ramotswe's own impending marriage to that most gentlemanly of men, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, the promotion of her secretary to the dizzy heights of Assistant Detective and new additions to the Matekoni family, all brew up the most humorous and charmingly entertaining of tales.",

The last thing he expected after being called back to his Carpathian homeland by Prince Mikhail was to catch the scent of his destined lifemate in MaryAnn Delaney. MaryAnn is human, but she knows all too well the overwhelmingly aggressive instincts of Carpathian males. And they\ufffdre not exactly the kind of men she\ufffdd prefer to be bound to for life.<br /><br />A dedicated counselor for battered women, MaryAnn has a fulfilling life with no room for someone like Manolito, born and bred in the Carpathian Mountains, a law unto himself. But when MaryAnn agrees to go to South America to offer guidance to a brutalized young woman, she has no idea of the trap that awaits her in the sweltering thick of the jungle. She has been lured there by Manolito himself, who has seductive plans for the unaware, irresistibly human female.<br /><br />Once there, she will be his. Once his, she never will be released. He is her lover, her predator, her lifemate. She is his dark possession\ufffd",

Without their lifemates, and facing a scarcity of females, male Carpathians live a cold, colorless existence fighting encroaching madness.\n    \n    When their solitary prince discovers a possible lifemate in a unique human woman, the Carpathians realize there may yet be hope of saving their species from extinction and sparing innocent lives from those fully-crazed males: vampires.",

    "description": "In Raising Cain, Dan Kindlon, Ph.D., and Michael Thompson, Ph.D., two of the country's leading child psychologists, share what they have learned in more than thirty-five years of combined experience working with boys and their families. They reveal a nation of boys who are hurting--sad, afraid, angry, and silent. Kindlon and Thompson set out to answer this basic, crucial question: What do boys need that they're not getting? They illuminate the forces that threaten our boys, teaching them to believe that \"cool\" equals macho strength and stoicism. Cutting through outdated theories of \"mother blame,\" \"boy biology,\" and \"testosterone,\" the authors shed light on the destructive emotional training our boys receive--the emotional miseducation of boys.<br /><br />Kindlon and Thompson make a compelling case that emotional literacy is the most valuable gift we can offer our sons, urging parents to recognize the price boys pay when we hold them to an impossible standard of manhood. They identify the social and emotional challenges that boys encounter in school and show how parents can help boys cultivate emotional awareness and empathy--giving them the vital connections and support they need to navigate the social pressures of youth.",

    "description": "A chilling, mesmerizing novel that combines the best of modern forensic thrillers with the detail and drama of historical fiction. In medieval Cambridge, England, four children have been murdered. The crimes are immediately blamed on the town's Jewish community, taken as evidence that Jews sacrifice Christian children in blasphemous ceremonies. To save them from the rioting mob, the king places the Cambridge Jews under his protection and hides them in a castle fortress. King Henry II is no friend of the Jews-or anyone, really-but he is invested in their fate. Without the taxes received from Jewish merchants, his treasuries would go bankrupt. Hoping scientific investigation will exonerate the Jews, Henry calls on his cousin the King of Sicily-whose subjects include the best medical experts in Europe-and asks for his finest \"master of the art of death,\" an early version of the medical examiner. The Italian doctor chosen for the task is a young prodigy from the University of Salerno. But her name is Adelia-the king has been sent a \"mistress\" of the art of death. Adelia and her companions-Simon, a Jew, and Mansur, a Moor-travel to England to unravel the mystery of the Cambridge murders, which turn out to be the work of a serial killer, most likely one who has been on Crusade with the king. In a backward and superstitious country like England, Adelia must conceal her true identity as a doctor in order to avoid accusations of witchcraft. Along the way, she is assisted by Sir Rowley Picot, one of the king's tax collectors, a man with a personal stake in the investigation. Rowley may be a needed friend, or the fiend for whom they are searching. As Adelia's investigation takes her into Cambridge's shadowy river paths and behind the closed doors of its churches and nunneries, the hunt intensifies and the killer prepares to strike again . .",

Antonio and Natasha's world is turned upside down, and their young love is put to the test, when Antonio finds himself in jail, accused of a shocking crime. Antonio fights to stay alive on the inside, while on the outside, Natasha faces choices that will change her life. Over the course of a decade, they share a desperate correspondence. Often, they have only each other to turn to as life takes them down separate paths and leaves them wondering if they will ever find their way back together.<br /><br />Startling, real, and filled with raw emotion, <i>Upstate</i> is an unforgettable coming-of-age story with a message of undeniable hope. Brilliant and profoundly felt, it is destined to speak to a new generation of readers.",

Failing to make his name in his dull provincial hometown, he is taken up by a patroness, the captivating married woman Madame de Bargeton, and prepares to forge his way in the glamorous beau monde of Paris. But Lucien has entered a world far more dangerous than he realized, as Madame de Bargeton's reputation becomes compromised and the fickle, venomous denizens of the courts and salons conspire to keep him out of their ranks. Lucien eventually learns that, wherever he goes, talent counts for nothing in comparison to money, intrigue and unscrupulousness. Lost Illusions is one of the greatest novels in the rich procession of the Comedie humaine, Balzac's panoramic social and moral history of his times.",

    "description": "<b>An invaluable set of career-length interviews with the German genius hailed by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut as \"the most important film director alive\"</b><br /><br />Most of what we've heard about Werner Herzog is untrue. The sheer number of false rumors and downright lies disseminated about the man and his films is truly astonishing. Yet Herzog's body of work is one of the most important in postwar European cinema.<br /> His international breakthrough came in 1973 with <i>Aguirre, The Wrath of God</i>, in which Klaus Kinski played a crazed Conquistador. For<i> The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser</i>, Herzog cast in the lead a man who had spent most of his life institutionalized, and two years later he hypnotized his entire cast to make <i>Heart of Glass</i>. He rushed to an explosive volcanic Caribbean island to film <i>La Soufri\u00e8re</i>, paid homage to F. W. Murnau in a terrifying remake of <i>Nosferatu</i>, and in 1982 dragged a boat over a mountain in the Amazon jungle for <i>Fitzcarraldo</i>. More recently, Herzog has made extraordinary \"documentary\" films such as <i>Little Dieter Needs to Fly</i>. His place in cinema history is assured, and Paul Cronin's volume of dialogues provides a forum for Herzog's fascinating views on the things, ideas, and people that have preoccupied him for so many years.",

    "description": "By the French author, who, along with Flaubert, is generally regarded as a founding-father of realism in European fiction. His large output of works, collectively entitled The Human Comedy (La Comedie Humaine), consists of 95 finished works (stories, novels and essays) and 48 unfinished works. His stories are an attempt to comprehend and depict the realities of life in contemporary bourgeois France. They are placed in a variety of settings, with characters reappearing in multiple stories. Balzac entered the mainstream with The Magic Skin (La Peau de Chagrin) (1831), a fable-like tale delineating the excesses and vanities of contemporary life.",

    "description": "Ignored by virtually everyone upon its release in November 1968, 'The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society' is now seen as one of the best British albums ever recorded. Here, Andy Miller traces the perilous circumstances surrounding its creation, and celebrates the timeless, perfectly crafted songs pieced together by a band who were on the verge of disintegration and who refused to follow fashion.<br /><br />EXCERPT<br />'Big Sky' contains some of the most beautiful, thunderous music The Kinks ever recorded, aligned to a vulnerability and warmth no other group - and I mean no other group - could ever hope to equal. It is a perfectly balanced production. On the one hand, the mesh of clattering drums and electric guitar never threatens to overwhelm the melody; on the other, the gossamer-light harmonies, Ray and Dave's vocal line traced by Rasa Davies' wordless falsetto, are bursting with emotion. When most of the instruments drop away at 1.20, the effect is effortlessly vivid - two lines where Davies' performance is both nonchalant and impassioned. The result is wonderfully, enchantingly sad, made more so perhaps by the knowledge that The Kinks will never again sound so refined or so right.",

In the still darkness of their cell, Molina re-weaves the glittering and fragile stories of the film he loves, and the cynical Valentin listens. Valentin believes in the just cause which makes all suffering bearable; Molina believes in the magic of love which makes all else endurable. Each has always been alone, and always - especially now - in danger of betrayal. But in cell 7 each surrenders to the other something of himself that he has never surrendered before.",

    "description": "Although Kingsley Amis's acid satire of postwar British academic life has lost some of its bite in the four decades since it was published, it's still a rewarding read. And there's no denying how big an impact it had back then--<i>Lucky Jim</i> could be considered the first shot in the Oxbridge salvo that brought us <i>Beyond the Fringe</i>, <i>That Was the Week That Was</i>, and so much more. <br /><br />In <i>Lucky Jim</i>, Amis introduces us to Jim Dixon, a junior lecturer at a British college who spends his days fending off the legions of malevolent twits that populate the school. His job is in constant danger, often for good reason. <i>Lucky Jim</i> hits the heights whenever Dixon tries to keep a preposterous situation from spinning out of control, which is every three pages or so. The final example of this--a lecture spewed by a hideously pickled Dixon--is a chapter's worth of comic nirvana. The book is not politically correct (Amis wasn't either), but take it for what it is, and you won't be disappointed.",

    "description": "Another strong, satisfying novel, full of rich storytelling, by the author of the favourite THE TEA ROSE.<br /><br />An epic tale of secret love and hidden passions. It is 1900 and the dangerous streets of East London are no place for a well-bred woman. But India Selwyn Jones is headstrong: she has trained as one of a new breed, a woman doctor, and is determined to practice where the need is greatest. It is in these grim streets where India meets - and saves the life of - London's most notorious gangster, Sid Malone. Hard, violent, devastatingly attractive, Malone is the opposite of India's cool, aristocratic fiance. though Malone represents all she despises, India finds herself unwillingly drawn ever closer to him - enticed by his charm, intrigued by his hidden, mysterious past. tHE WINtER ROSE brings the beginning of the turbulent twentieth century vividly to life, drawing the reader into its wretched underworld, its privileged society, and the shadowland between the two, where the strict rules of the time blur into secret passions. Praise for tHE tEA ROSE: 'Most seductive . . . the writing is so fluid you feel the author simply loves telling her story' Frank McCourt 'I loved this vividly researched and wonderfully rumbustious yarn - brilliantly told, great fun to read' Simon Winchester",

    "description": "Abalone, Arizona, is a sleepy southwestern town whose chief concerns are boredom and surviving the Great Depression. That is, until the circus of Dr. Lao arrives and immensely\u00a0and irrevocably changes the lives of everyone drawn to its tents.\u00a0Expecting a sideshow spectacle, the citizens of Abalone instead confront and learn profound lessons from the mythical made real--a chimera, a Medusa, a talking sphinx, a sea serpent, witches, the Hound of the Hedges, a werewolf, a mermaid, an ancient god, and the elusive, ever-changing Dr. Lao. The circus unfolds, spinning magical, dark strands that ensnare the town's populace: the sea serpent's tale shatters love's illusions; the fortune-teller's shocking pronouncements toll the tedium and secret dread of every person's life; sensual undercurrents pour forth for men and women alike; and the dead walk again.\u00a0Dazzling and macabre, literary and philosophical, <i>The Circus of Dr. Lao</i> has been acclaimed as a masterpiece of speculative fiction and influenced such writers as Ray Bradbury. This Bison Frontiers of Imagination edition features a new introduction by noted fantasy writer John Marco and striking illustrations by Boris Artzybasheff from the first edition.",

    "description": "Astrology, Psychology and the Four Elements by Stephen Arroyo, a recognized classic in modern astrology, is truly a pioneering book in the field of astrology. It establishes a new science of astrological psychology. Arroyo presents a language of energy that has enabled astrology to be widely and reliably used in the helping professions as well as by the general public. As Library Journal stated, \"Transcending the boundaries of separate disciplines, this work represents a major distillation of astrological principles.\" This book relates astrology to modern psychology and explains the use of astrology as a practical method of understanding one's attunement to universal forces. It clearly shows how to approach astrology with a real understanding of the energies involved, and it includes practical instruction in the interpretation of astrological factors with more depth than is commonly found in astrological textbooks. It was awarded the Astrology Prize by the British Astrological Association.",

    "description": "Since it appeared in 1971, John Rawls's A Theory of Justice has become a classic. The author has now revised the original edition to clear up a number of difficulties he and others have found in the original book.<br /><br />Rawls aims to express an essential part of the common core of the democratic tradition - justice as fairness - and to provide an alternative to utilitarianism, which had dominated the Anglo-Saxon tradition of political thought since the nineteenth century. Rawls substitutes the ideal of the social contract as a more satisfactory account of the basic rights and liberties of citizens as free and equal persons. \"Each person,\" writes Rawls, \"possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override.\" Advancing the ideas of Rousseau, Kant, Emerson, and Lincoln, Rawls's theory is as powerful today as it was when first published.",

As the villagers and the Castle officials block his efforts at every turn, K.\u2019s consuming quest\u2013quite possibly a self-imposed one\u2013to penetrate the inaccessible heart of the Castle and take its measure is repeatedly frustrated. Kafka once suggested that the would-be surveyor in <i>The Castle</i> is driven by a wish \u201cto get clear about ultimate things,\u201d an unrealizable desire that provided the driving force behind all of Kafka\u2019s dazzlingly uncanny fictions. <br /><br />Translated by Willa and Edwin Muir<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "Northanger Abbey depicts the misadventures of Catherine Morland, young, ingenuous, and mettlesome, and an indefatigable reader of gothic novels. Their romantic excess and dark overstatement feed her imagination, as tyrannical fathers and diabolical villains work their evil on forlorn heroines in isolated settings. What could be more remote from the uneventful securities of life in the midland counties of England? Yet as Austen brilliantly contrasts fiction with reality, ordinary life takes a more sinister turn, and edginess and circumspection are reaffirmed alongside comedy and literary burlesque.<br /> Also including Austen's other short fictions, Lady Susan, The Watsons, and Sanditon, this valuable new edition shows her to be as innovative at the start of her career as at its close.",

Erasmus--the unlikely prince--is a 300-pound ape. Brought to the Burdens' London home after escaping from animal smugglers, Erasmus is discovered to be a highly intelligent anthropoid ape, the closest thing yet to a human being. Madelene decides to save Erasmus, and between them blossoms a profound affection as deep as any human relationship. A fable for our time, <i>The Woman and the Ape</i> poses searching questions about the nature of love, freedom, and humanity.",

    "description": "This classic of Christian apologetics seeks to persuade the skeptic that there are good reasons to believe in God even though it is impossible to understand the Deity fully. First written over a century ago, the <i>Grammar of Assent</i> speaks as powerfully to us today as it did to its first readers. Because of the informal, non-technical character of Newman's work, it still retains its immediacy as an invaluable guide to the nature of religious belief. An introduction by Nicholas Lash reviews the background of the <i>Grammar</i>, highlights its principal themes, and evaluates its philosophical originality.",

    "description": "Is God a wrathful judge? A gentle healer? A father? Brother? Friend?<br />In <i>The Relentless Tenderness of Jesus</i>, Brennan Manning brings you to a deeper understanding of the true nature of God. Through poignant and unforgettable stories and challenging observations, Manning helps you stretch your mind and reject simplistic explanations of who God really is. With rich insights you'll see how God can at once be a roaring lion, pacing the globe and seeking you out; and simultaneously a tender lamb, there to comfort you in any time of need.<br />A unique experience, this book will forever change the way you think about God.",
