He started it when he was in the US Army, so it has a long prison sequence that is reminiscent of that experience, being dark and grim. <br /><br />The author regards this as perhaps the most intricately structured novel the science fantasy genre has seen.<br /><br />Aton's crime was simple. He loved a minionette. All worlds despised and feared this almost mythical siren but no creature anywhere could tell him why.<br /><br />In the brutally hot, subterranean garnet caves of chthon to which he had been condemned, Aton sought an answer.<br /><br />And when he could not find it--he determined to seek it elsewhere.<br /><br />No man had ever escaped Chthon and lived. But the minionette called. Aton had to have his answer.<br /><br />So did Chthon...",

    "description": "Now 20 years old, Jim Henson's classic fantasy film <i>The Dark Crystal</i>--featuring the breathtaking concept design of renowned fantasy artist Brian Froud--is a soaring work of the imagination. This mystical adventure has such a huge cult following that when the film was recently re-released on video and DVD, it quickly sold a million copies. Just as remarkable is the cult status of <i>The World of The Dark Crystal</i>, Froud's book on the film. Originally published in 1982 and long out of print, this definitive volume--packed with brilliant artwork--has been in such demand that used copies can sell for well over $400. <p>Abrams is now proudly reissuing this sought-after book in a brand new collector's edition. This beautifully printed reproduction of the original volume contains all of its stunning art and text--plus a new essay by Froud, illustrated with never-before-published paintings, drawings, and sculptures from the film's archives. And this new edition features a facsimile of a 20-page booklet Froud and Henson created to present the film to backers--a gorgeous overview of the story so rare only a few copies are known to exist. This collector's edition of <i>The World of The Dark Crystal</i>, like the re-released film, will truly be a must-have for Henson and Froud fans.</p>",

    "description": "Located somewhere in \"a world apart,\" just beyond the reach of current navigational tools, lies the land of the Snergs, a haven for countless neglected children, all of whom are watched over by maternal women. Also inhabited by a sturdy race of generous people no taller than the average table, the realm is surrounded by a forest occupied by friendly bears.<br />Into this unusual kingdom come Joe and Sylvia, two youngsters who have slipped away from home in search of excitement and adventure. They get more than enough of both as they come upon the children, as well as kings, knights, an evil witch, and a cap of invisibility (which doesn't seem to work.) Accompanied by Gordo, a dwarfish Snerg with a reputation for being a lovable klutz, the trio leapfrogs from one fantastic adventure to another.<br />Tolkien called this forgotten classic a \"sourcebook\" for <i>The Hobbit. </i>A whimsical delight for readers of all ages, this E. A. Wyke-Smith's enthralling adventures is must-reading for any <i>Rings</i> fan.",

    "description": "\"She remains a thinker and activist who 'insists upon complexity.' \" -Reamy Jansen, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br /><br /><i>Some of Us Did Not Die</i> brings together a rich sampling of the late poet June Jordan's prose writings. The essays in this collection, which include her last writings and span the length of her extraordinary career, reveal Jordan as an incisive analyst of the personal and public costs of remaining committed to the ideal and practice of democracy. Willing to venture into the most painful contradictions of American culture and politics, Jordan comes back with lyrical honesty, wit, and wide-ranging intelligence in these accounts of her reckoning with life as a teacher, poet, activist, and citizen.",

    "description": "Perhaps the greatest book by one of our greatest historians, <i>The Discoverers: A History of Man's Search to Know His World &amp; Himself</i> is a volume of sweeping range and majestic interpretation. To call it a history of science is an understatement; this is the story of how humankind has come to know the world, however incompletely (\"the eternal mystery of the world,\" Einstein once said, \"is its comprehensibility\"). Daniel J. Boorstin first describes the liberating concept of time--\"the first grand discovery\"--and continues through the age of exploration and the advent of the natural and social sciences. The approach is idiosyncratic, with Boorstin lingering over particular figures and accomplishments rather than rushing on to the next set of names and dates. It's also primarily Western, although Boorstin does ask (and answer) several interesting questions: Why didn't the Chinese \"discover\" Europe and America? Why didn't the Arabs circumnavigate the planet? His thesis about discovery ultimately turns on what he calls \"illusions of knowledge.\" If we think we know something, then we face an obstacle to innovation. The great discoverers, Boorstin shows, dispel the illusions and reveal something new about the world. <p> Although <i>The Discoverers</i> easily stands on its own, it is technically the first entry in a trilogy that also includes <i>The Creators</i> and <i>The Seekers</i>. An outstanding book--one of the best works of history to be found anywhere. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>",

    "description": "HE MAY HAVE PHOTOGRAPHED A MURDER.<br /><br />Herb just wanted to photograph the cheerleaders in the school showers. He planted his camera high in the corner where no one could see it, and rigged it to a special homemade timer. He did that Thursday night, and he hoped that by Friday night he would have an exciting roll of film to develop.<p>But a girl dies Friday afternoon. On the surface it appears to be nothing more than a tragic car accident. But when Herb finally does collect his roll of film, he develops a picture that shows a shadowy figure sneaking up on the girl who has died - sneaking up on her with a baseball bat. It makes Herb wonder if the girl was dead long before the car accident. But unfortunately for Herb, he doesn't wonder if the murderer knows he took the picture.</p>",

    "description": "Iron &amp; Silk, Mark Salzman's bestselling account of his adventures as an English teacher and martial arts student in China, introduced a writer of enormous charm and keen insight into the cultural chasm between East and West. Now Salzman returns to China in his first novel, which follows the adventures of Hsun-ching, a naive but courageous orphan, and the formidable and mysterious Colonel Sun, who together travel from mainland China to San Francisco, risking everything to track down an elusive Buddhist scripture called The Laughing Sutra. Part Tom Sawyer, part Tom Jones, The Laughing Sutra draws us into an irresistible narrative of danger and comedy that speaks volumes about the nature of freedom and the meaning of loyalty.",

    "description": "This collection features a brilliant new translation of the Japanese master's stories, from the source for the movie <i>Rash\u014dmon</i> to his later, more autobiographical writings.<br /><br />Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa (1892-1927) is one of Japan\u2019s foremost stylists - a modernist master whose short stories are marked by highly original imagery, cynicism, beauty and wild humour. \u2018<i>Rash\u014dmon</i>\u2019 and \u2018<i>In a Bamboo Grove</i>\u2019 inspired Kurosawa\u2019s magnificent film and depict a past in which morality is turned upside down, while tales such as \u2018<i>The Nose</i>\u2019, \u2018<i>O-Gin</i>\u2019 and \u2018<i>Loyalty</i>\u2019 paint a rich and imaginative picture of a medieval Japan peopled by Shoguns and priests, vagrants and peasants. And in later works such as \u2018<i>Death Register</i>\u2019, \u2018<i>The Life of a Stupid Man</i>\u2019 and \u2018<i>Spinning Gears</i>\u2019, Akutagawa drew from his own life to devastating effect, revealing his intense melancholy and terror of madness in exquisitely moving impressionistic stories.<br /><br />A WORLD IN DECAY<br />- <i>Rash\u014dmon</i><br />- <i>In a Bamboo Grove</i><br />- <i>The Nose</i><br />- <i>Dragon: The Old Potter's Tale</i><br />- <i>The Spider Thread</i><br />- <i>Hell Screen</i><br />UNDER THE SWORD<br />- <i>Dr. Ogata Ry\u014dsai: Memorandum</i><br />- <i>O-Gin</i><br />- <i>Loyalty</i><br />MODERN TRAGICOMEDY<br />- <i>The Story of a Head That Fell Off</i><br />- <i>Green Onions</i><br />- <i>Horse Legs</i><br />AKUTAGAWA'S OWN STORY<br />- <i>Daid\u014dji Shinsuke: The Early Years</i><br />- <i>The Writer's Craft</i><br />- <i>The Baby's Sickness</i><br />- <i>Death Register</i><br />- <i>The Life of a Stupid Man</i><br />- <i>Spinning Gears</i><br /><br />",

    "description": "The literary theories of American expatriate Gertrude Stein (1874\u20131946) strongly influenced a generation of young American writers (notably Hemingway), and her ideas about writing still provoke and stimulate.<br />Although much of her own work embodies innovative experimentation with language and sound, the present volume is fairly conventional in style and quite accessible. Regarded by some critics as a minor masterpiece, <i>Three Lives</i> was Stein's first published book. In it she tells the stories of three working class women \u2014 Anna, a conscientious but rigid serving woman; Melanctha, a worldly-wise and sensitive black girl; and Lena, a gentle but feeble-minded maid.<br />Although these are relatively ordinary women, in Stein's hands their lives and minds take on extraordinary interest. Told in clear, carefully crafted prose, these storeis are not only memorable works in themselves but an excellent entree to Stein's later work.",

Howard. He is a hero, a well known and iconic figure in American fantasy, and the most famous barbarian in fiction.\n    \n    Several authors have contributed to Conan legacy since Howard, including: Poul Anderson, Leonard Carpenter, Lin Carter, L. Sprague de Camp, Roland J. Green, John C. Hocking, Robert Jordan, Sean A. Moore, Bj\u00f6rn Nyberg, Andrew J. Offutt, Steve Perry, John Maddox Roberts, Harry Turtledove, and Karl Edward Wagner.\n    \n    Further adventures <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/51059-adventures-of-conan\">here</a>.\n    \n    One suggested reading order here: http://www.barbariankeep.com/galen.html",

            "description": "The first comprehensive paperback edition, which compiled the existing Howard and non-Howard stories together with new non-Howard stories in chronological order, to form a complete account of Conan's life. Lancer Books initially numbered its volumes in order of publication, switching to a chronological numbering for volumes published later and reprints or the earlier volumes. Lancer went out of business before bringing out the entire series, and publication was completed by Ace Books.\n    \n    This edition of the stories was the one that introduced Conan into popular culture. Undertaken under the direction of De Camp and Carter, it includes all the original Howard material, including that left unpublished in his lifetime and fragments and outlines. De Camp edited much of the material and he and Carter completed the stories that were not in finished form. New stories written entirely by themselves were added as well. In the following list, volumes 6 and 11\u201312 do not contain any material by Howard. Of the thirty-five stories in the other eight volumes, nineteen were published or completed by Howard during his lifetime, ten are rewritten or completed from his manuscripts, fragments or synopses, and six are the sole work of De Camp and Carter. Most of the covers of this edition featured dynamic images by Frank Frazetta that, for many fans, presented the \"definitive\" impression of Conan and his world.\n    \n    <i>from Wikipedia.",

Howard. He is a hero, a well known and iconic figure in American fantasy, and the most famous barbarian in fiction.\n    \n    Several authors have contributed to Conan legacy since Howard, including: Poul Anderson, Leonard Carpenter, Lin Carter, L.

            "description": "The first comprehensive paperback edition, which compiled the existing Howard and non-Howard stories together with new non-Howard stories in chronological order, to form a complete account of Conan's life. Lancer Books initially numbered its volumes in order of publication, switching to a chronological numbering for volumes published later and reprints or the earlier volumes. Lancer went out of business before bringing out the entire series, and publication was completed by Ace Books.\n    \n    This edition of the stories was the one that introduced Conan into popular culture. Undertaken under the direction of De Camp and Carter, it includes all the original Howard material, including that left unpublished in his lifetime and fragments and outlines. De Camp edited much of the material and he and Carter completed the stories that were not in finished form. New stories written entirely by themselves were added as well. In the following list, volumes 6 and 11\u201312 do not contain any material by Howard. Of the thirty-five stories in the other eight volumes, nineteen were published or completed by Howard during his lifetime, ten are rewritten or completed from his manuscripts, fragments or synopses, and six are the sole work of De Camp and Carter. Most of the covers of this edition featured dynamic images by Frank Frazetta that, for many fans, presented the \"definitive\" impression of Conan and his world.\n    \n    <i>from Wikipedia.",

    "description": "Includes the plays Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone, collectively known as the Theban plays. Starting with Oedipus the King and ending with the ultimate sacrifice of Antigone, his daughter the plays follow the trials of a family cursed by the edict of an oracle that \"you will kill your father and marry with your mother\". From the fourth century BC - when Aristotle took Oedipus the King as his model tragedy, the influence of Sophocles' great plays has been assured. These three great tragedies have a relevance and immediacy as metaphors for some of the most fundamentally held beliefs and values in our culture.<br />This volume contains the Theban plays - widely studied in schools and universities. Translated and with an introduction and notes from Don Taylor - the playwright who directed these plays for BBC TV",

    "description": "Gore Vidal's Narratives of Empire series spans the history of the United States from the Revolution to the post-World War II years. With their broad canvas and large cast of fictional and historical characters, the novels in this series present a panorama of the American political and imperial experience as interpreted by one of its most worldly, knowing, and ironic observers.<br /><br />To most Americans, Abraham Lincoln is a monolithic figure, the Great Emancipator and Savior of the Union, beloved by all. In Gore Vidal's Lincoln we meet Lincoln the man and Lincoln the political animal, the president who entered a besieged capital where most of the population supported the South and where even those favoring the Union had serious doubts that the man from Illinois could save it. Far from steadfast in his abhorrence of slavery, Lincoln agonizes over the best course of action and comes to his great decision only when all else seems to fail. As the Civil War ravages his nation, Lincoln must face deep personal turmoil, the loss of his dearest son, and the harangues of a wife seen as a traitor for her Southern connections. Brilliantly conceived, masterfully executed, Gore Vidal's Lincoln allows the man to breathe again.",

Published between 1967 and 2000, they chronicle the history of Vidal's \"American Empire\", from dawn to decay, by interweaving the private stories of two fictional American families with the public stories of historical personages. Although the seven novels were not published in order of historical chronology, they can be read in either historical or publication order without sacrificing narrative intelligibility. Vidal insisted on the title \"Narratives of Empire\" for the series, despite his publishers\u2019 preference for the safer, mainstream \"American Chronicles\".",

Then \"The Store\" announces plans to open a local outlet, which will surely finish off the small downtown shops. His concerns grow when \"The Store's\" builders ignore all the town's zoning laws during its construction. Then dead animals are found on \"The Store's\" grounds. Inside, customers are hounded by obnoxious sales people, and strange products appear on the shelves. Before long the town's remaining small shop owners disappear, and \"The Store\" spreads its influence to the city council and the police force, taking over the town! It's up to one man to confront \"The Store's\" mysterious owner and to save his community, his family, and his life!",

In <em>The Princess Test</em>, the author spoofs the notion that a pea can prove a person's pedigree. <em>Princess Sonora and the Long Sleep</em> features a genius of a princess, a hundred years of snooze, two princes, and a flock of balding sheep! Cinderella is a boy in <em>Cinderellis and the Glass Hill</em>, and the glass slipper is a glass hill. In <em>For Biddle's Sake</em>, Parsley tries to forget her beloved prince and get used to life as a Biddlebum Toad. The road to happily-ever-after isn't easy when a baker's son and a princess fall in love in <em>The Fairy's Return</em>.<br /><br />Elements of the classics are woven into these not-so-typical retellings of \"Toads and Diamonds,\" \"The Princess and the Pea,\" \"Sleeping Beauty,\" \"The Princess on the Glass Hill,\" \"Puddocky,\" and \"The Golden Goose.\" The fresh and funny twists on favorite fairy tales will win the hearts and capture the imaginations of young readers everywhere.",

    "description": "A major literary event, the publication of this masterly translation makes one of the towering works of twentieth-century German literature available to English-speaking readers for the first time. The three-volume novel <i>The Aesthetics of Resistance</i> is the crowning achievement of Peter Weiss, the internationally renowned dramatist best known for his play <i>Marat/Sade</i>. The first volume, presented here, was initially published in Germany in 1975; the third and final volume appeared in 1981, just six months before Weiss\u2019s death.Spanning the period from the late 1930s to World War II, this historical novel dramatizes anti-fascist resistance and the rise and fall of proletarian political parties in Europe. Living in Berlin in 1937, the unnamed narrator and his peers\u2014sixteen- and seventeen-year-old working-class students\u2014seek ways to express their hatred for the Nazi regime. They meet in museums and galleries, and in their discussions they explore the affinity between political resistance and art, the connection at the heart of Weiss\u2019s novel. Weiss suggests that meaning lies in embracing resistance, no matter how intense the oppression, and that we must look to art for new models of political action and social understanding. The novel includes extended meditations on paintings, sculpture, and literature. Moving from the Berlin underground to the front lines of the Spanish Civil War and on to other parts of Europe, the story teems with characters, almost all of whom are based on historical figures. <i>The Aesthetics of Resistance</i> is one of the truly great works of postwar German literature and an essential resource for understanding twentieth-century German history.",

Martin, a writer of unsurpassed vision, power, and imagination, has created a landmark of fantasy fiction. In his widely acclaimed <i>A Game of Thrones,</i> he introduced us to an extraordinary world of wonder, intrigue, and adventure. Now, in the eagerly awaited second volume in this epic saga, he once again proves himself a master myth-maker, setting a standard against which all other fantasy novels will be measured for years to come.<br /><br /><b>A CLASH OF KINGS</b><br /><br />Time is out of joint. The summer of peace and plenty, ten years long, is drawing to a close, and the harsh, chill winter approaches like an angry beast. Two great leaders \u2014 Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon \u2014 who held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead... victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war.<br /><br />As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky \u2014 a comet the color of blood and flame \u2014 six factions struggle for control of a divided land. Eddard's son Robb has declared himself King in the North. In the south, Joffrey, the heir apparent, rules in name only, victim of the scheming courtiers who teem over King's Landing. Robert's two brothers each seek their own dominion, while a disfavored house turns once more to conquest. And a continent away, an exiled queen, the Mother of Dragons, risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that is rightfully hers.<br /><br /><i>A Clash of Kings</i> transports us into a magnificent, forgotten land of revelry and revenge, wizardry and warfare. It is a tale in which maidens cavort with madmen, brother plots against brother, and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside.<br /><br />Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, the price of glory may be measured in blood. And the spoils of victory may just go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel... and the coldest hearts. For when rulers clash, all of the land feels the tremors.<br /><br />Audacious, inventive, brilliantly imagined, <i>A Clash of Kings</i> is a novel of dazzling beauty and boundless enchantment \u2014 a tale of pure excitement you will never forget.<br /><br />",

    "description": "Once the Orme family\u2019s magnificent ancestral estate, Observatory Mansions is now a crumbling apartment complex, home to an eccentric group of misfits. One of them is Francis Orme, who earns his livelihood as a living statue. When not practicing \u201cinner and outer stillness,\u201d Francis steals the cherished possessions of others to add to his private museum. The other tenants are equally as odd: his mother and father, who haven\u2019t interacted in years; a man who continually sweats and cries; a recluse who prefers television to reality; and a woman who behaves like a dog. When Anna Tapp arrives among them she stirs their souls, bringing long forgotten memories to the surface\u2013and arousing fears that this new resident intends to provoke a metamorphosis.",

    "description": "<b>A IS FOR AVENGER</b><br />A tough-talking former cop, private investigator Kinsey Millhone has set up a modest detective agency in a quiet corner of Santa Teresa, California. A twice-divorced loner with few personal possessions and fewer personal attachments, she's got a soft spot for underdogs and lost causes.<br /><br /><b>A IS FOR ACCUSED</b><br />That's why she draws desperate clients like Nikki Fife. Eight years ago, she was convicted of killing her philandering husband. Now she's out on parole and needs Kinsey's help to find the real killer. But after all this time, clearing Nikki's bad name won't be easy.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i>A IS FOR ALIBI</i>\n</b><br />If there's one thing that makes Kinsey Millhone feel alive, it's playing on the edge. When her investigation turns up a second corpse, more suspects, and a new reason to kill, Kinsey discovers that the edge is closer--and sharper--than she imagined.<br /><br />\"A\" Is for Alibi<br />\"B\" Is for Burglar<br />\"C\" Is for Corpse<br />\"D\" Is for Deadbeat<br />\"E\" Is for Evidence<br />\"F\" Is for Fugitive<br />\"G\" Is for Gumshoe<br />\"H\" Is for Homicide<br />\"I\" Is for Innocent<br />\"J\" Is for Judgment<br />\"K\" Is for Killer<br />\"L\" is for Lawless<br />\"M\" Is for Malice<br />\"N\" Is for Noose<br />\"O\" Is for Outlaw<br />\"P\" Is for Peril <br />\"Q\" Is for Quarry<br />\"R\" Is for Ricochet <br />\"S\" Is for Silence <br />\"T\" Is for Trespass<br />\"U\" Is for Undertow <br />\"V\" Is for Vengeance <br />\"W\" Is for Wasted <br />\"X\" <br /> \u201cY\u201d Is for Yesterday<br />The letter Z was unfinished at the time of her death 12/28/2017",

Moreover, as the rebel whose satiric genius had earned him not only international acclaim, but two stays in the Bastille, flogging and exile, Voltaire knew personally what suffering involved.<br /></p><p>In <i>Candide</i> he whisks his young hero and friends through a ludicrious variety of tortures, tragedies and reversals of fortune, in the company of Pangloss, a 'matapysico-theologo-cosmolo-nigologist' of unflinching optimism. The result is one of the glories of the eighteenth-century satire.</p>",

So simple that Kinsey wonders why he doesn't deliver the money himself. She's almost certain something is off. But with rent due, Kinsey accepts Limardo's retainer against her better judgment\u2026<br /><br />When Limardo's check bounces, Kinsey discovers she's been had big time. Alvin Limardo is really John Daggett\u2014an ex-con with a drinking problem, two wives to boot, and a slew of people who would like to see him dead. Now Kinsey is out four hundred dollars and in hot pursuit of Daggett.<br /><br />When Daggett's corpse shows up floating in the Santa Teresa surf, the cops rule the death an accident. Kinsey thinks it's murder. But seeking justice for a man who everyone seemed to despise is going to be a lot tougher than she bargained for\u2014and what awaits her at the end of the road is much more disturbing than she could've ever imagined\u2026",

Life was wonderful, full of magic -- and about to be altered irrevocably by a magic more real than any he dared imagine. <br /><br />For with the Magic came the Bad Thing, and the Faerie, and then the Fool. . .and the resurrection of a primordial war with a forgotten people -- a war that not only the Hastings but the whole human race could lose.",

    "description": "In 1957, Ryszard Kapuscinski arrived in Africa to witness the beginning of the end of colonial rule as the first African correspondent of Poland's state newspaper. From the early days of independence in Ghana to the ongoing ethnic genocide in Rwanda, Kapuscinski has crisscrossed vast distances pursuing the swift, and often violent, events that followed liberation. Kapuscinski hitchhikes with caravans, wanders the Sahara with nomads, and lives in the poverty-stricken slums of Nigeria. He wrestles a king cobra to the death and suffers through a bout of malaria. What emerges is an extraordinary depiction of Africa--not as a group of nations or geographic locations--but as a vibrant and frequently joyous montage of peoples, cultures, and encounters. Kapuscinski's trenchant observations, wry analysis and overwhelming humanity paint a remarkable portrait of the continent and its people. His unorthodox approach and profound respect for the people he meets challenge conventional understandings of the modern problems faced by Africa at the dawn of the twenty-first century.",

    "description": "Deputy Sheriff Jim Doe plunges into a renegade manhunt after the Nazareth, Texas town sheriff is gunned down. But unbeknownst to him, the suspect-an American Indian-holds chilling connections to the disappearance of Doe's sister years before. And the closer Doe gets to the fugitive's trail, the more he realizes that his own involvement in the case is hardly coincidental. A descendant of the Blackfeet Nation himself, Doe keeps getting mistaken for the killer he's chasing. And when the FBI's finest three profilers descend on the case, Doe suspects the hunt has only just begun. <br />But beneath the novel's pyrotechnic plotting, the deeper psychic cadences of Stephen Graham Jones's prose take hold. In time, his specific imagery and telling detail coalesce into the literary equivalent of an Edward Hopper painting. But like the other seminal works in the genre (Fight Club, Red Dragon), All the Beautiful Sinners will unnerve you, and it will then send you back to page one to experience its mysteries all over again.<br />",

    "description": "His great battles against the sea raiders in the Nile Delta have left Pharoah Tuthmosis II frail, but he finds solace in victory and in the welcome he is sure to receive on his return to Thebes. Across the river from Thebes, however, there are those who do not relish his homecoming, and a group of assassins has taken a witch to pollute the Pharaoh's unfinished tomb. Reunited with his wife, Hatusu, and his people, Tuthmosis stands before the statue of Amun-Ra, the roar of the crowd and the fanfare of trumpets ringing in his ears. But within an hour he is dead and the people of Thebes cannot forget the omen of wounded doves flying overhead. Rumours run rife, speculation sweeps the royal city and Hatusu vows to uncover the truth. With the aid of Amerotke, a respected judge of Thebes, she embarks on a path destined to reveal the great secrets of Egypt.",

Returning to the scene of <i>Cannery Row</i>, the weedy lots and junk heaps and flophouses of Monterey, John Steinbeck once more brings to life the denizens of a netherworld of laughter and tears from Fauna, new headmistress of the local brothel, to Hazel, a bum whose mother must have wanted a daughter.<br /><br />",

Mrs Piggle-Wiggle has a treatment for all of them.<br /><br />The incomparable Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle loves children good or bad and never scolds but has positive cures for Answer-Backers, Never-Want-to-Go-to-Bedders, and other boys and girls with strange habits.

    "description": "Greg Bear is one of the greatest science fiction writers of the late twentieth century. He has a powerful voice, combining the intense rationality of science with the intensely passionate characters that can only be created by a writer who loves humanity. Bear\u2019s novel <i>Moving Mars</i> won the Nebula Award in 1994, and he did it again, in 2000, with Darwin\u2019s Radio. He has been honored with Hugo and Nebula nominations for novel-length work eight more times.<br /><br />But Greg Bear\u2019s short fiction is even more astounding, as this powerful career retrospective demonstrates. This collection contains Bear\u2019s earliest published fiction from the late 1960s and early 1970s as well his remarkable award-winning work from the \u201880s and \u201890s\u2014stories like the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning novella- length version of \u201cBlood Music\u201d and the Hugo and Nebula Award-winner \u201cTangents.\u201d<br /><br />This Collection is enhanced by brand-new introductions for each story, commentary, and reminiscences by Greg Bear.<br />",

    "description": "On July 26, Arthur Gordon learns that Europa, the sixth moon of Jupiter, has disappeared. Not hiding, not turned black, but gone. On September 28th, Edward Shaw, a geologist working in Death valley, finds a mysterious new cinder cone in very well-mapped area As more unexplained phenomena spring up around the globeL: a granite mountain appearing in Australia, sounds emanating from the Earth's core, flashes of light among the asteroids, it becomes clear to some that the end is approaching, and there is nothing that can be done. In The Forge of God, award-winning author Greg Bear describes the final days of the world on both a massive, scientific scale and in the everyday, emotional context of individual human lives. Facing the destruction of all they know, some people turn to God, others to their families, and a few turn to saviors promising escape from a planet tearing itself apart. Will they make it in time? And who gets left behind to experience the last moments of beauty and chaos on Earth?",

    "description": "<div>\n  <div>\n    <div><i>Moving Mars</i> is a story of human courage and love set within the greater saga of a planetary liberation movement. Mars is a colonial world, governed by corporate interests on Earth. The citizens of Mars are hardworking, but held back by their lack of access to the best education, and the desire of the Earthly powers to keep the best new inventions for themselves. The young Martians -- the second and third generations born on Mars -- have little loyalty to Earth, and a strong belief that their planet can be independent. The revolution begins slowly, but will grow in power over decades of political struggle until it becomes irresistible.</div>\n    <div> </div>\n    <div>Told through the eyes of an extraordinary character, Casseia Majumdar, a daughter of one of Mars' oldest, most conservative Binding Multiples, <i>Moving Mars</i> is Greg Bear's brilliant conception of the human colonization of the red planet, with lovingly painted details and a grand historical sweep, embellishing an audacious scientific speculation.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>",

But his fortune changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from his relatives and takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br /><br />After a lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally feels like a normal kid. But even within the Wizarding community, he is special. He is the boy who lived: the only person to have ever survived a killing curse inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a brutal takeover of the Wizarding world, only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.<br /><br />Though Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is perfect. There is a dangerous secret object hidden within the castle walls, and Harry believes it's his responsibility to prevent it from falling into evil hands. But doing so will bring him into contact with forces more terrifying than he ever could have imagined.<br /><br />Full of sympathetic characters, wildly imaginative situations, and countless exciting details, the first installment in the series assembles an unforgettable magical world and sets the stage for many high-stakes adventures to come.",

    "description": "A magnificent collection of short fiction focusing on the lives of African-American men and women in Washington, D.C., Lost in the City is the book that first brought author Edward P. Jones to national attention. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and numerous other honors for his novel The Known World, Jones made his literary debut with these powerful tales of ordinary people who live in the shadows in this metropolis of great monuments and rich history. Lost in the City received the Pen/Hemingway Award for Best First Fiction and was a National Book Award Finalist. This beautiful 20th Anniversary Edition features a new introduction by the author, and is a wonderful companion piece to Jones\u2019s masterful novel and his second acclaimed collection of stories, All Aunt Hagar\u2019s Children.",

    "description": "Although he didn't invent the Round Table or the tales of its fellowship, the twelfth-century poet Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes was the first to recount in verse the adventures of Arthur's knights. He is also chiefly responsible for establishing the importance of the Arthurian legend in European literature and assuring its survival into modern times. This sensitive translation of Chr\u00e9tien's verse narratives features four romances, including those of Erec and Enide, Clig\u00e9s, Yvain, and Lancelot.<br />Erec and Enide's tale illustrates how honor can be restored to a troubled relationship through acts of public duty. Clig\u00e9s' tale involves a forbidden relationship, in which a knight falls in love with his queen\u2014who is also his uncle's wife. The story of Yvain explores the effects of long-term absence on a questing knight's marriage. Lancelot's adventure, the rescue of Guinevere, is Chr\u00e9tien's enduring contribution to the tradition of Arthurian myth. The version included is a principal source of Mallory's popular <i>Le Morte d'Arthur.</i> Lively and accessible, these four romances form the most complete expression of the ideals of French chivalry by a single author.",

He studies a variety of conflicts over the course of history, as well as the testimony of those who have been most directly involved--participants, decision makers, and victims. In his introduction to this new edition, Walzer specifically addresses the moral issues surrounding the war in and occupation of Iraq, reminding us once again that \"the argument about war and justice is still a political and moral necessity.\"",

    "description": "Ward Churchill has achieved an unparalleled reputation as a scholar-activist and analyst of indigenous issues in North America. Here, he explores the history of holocaust and denial in this hemisphere, beginning with the arrival of Columbus and continuing on into the present.<br /><br />He frames the matter by examining both \"revisionist\" denial of the nazi-perpatrated Holocaust and the opposing claim of its exclusive \"uniqueness,\" using the full scope of what happened in Europe as a backdrop against which to demonstrate that genocide is precisely what has been-and still is-carried out against the American Indians.<br /><br />Churchill lays bare the means by which many of these realities have remained hidden, how public understanding of this most monstrous of crimes has been subverted not only by its perpetrators and their beneficiaries but by the institutions and individuals who perceive advantages in the confusion. In particular, he outlines the reasons underlying the United States's 40-year refusal to ratify the Genocide Convention, as well as the implications of the attempt to exempt itself from compliance when it finally offered its \"endorsement.\"<br /><br />In conclusion, Churchill proposes a more adequate and coherent definition of the crime as a basis for identifying, punishing, and preventing genocidal practices, wherever and whenever they occur.<br /><br />\"Ward Churchill opens the X-Files of American history to examine the phenomenon of genocide in eight essays. . .\" --Susan A. Miller, University of Nebraska-Lincoln<br /><br />\"Churchill relates the history of genocide and the struggle for a definition of the term sufficiently accurate and comprehensive, to prevent the watering down of the concept, and to cut through the misleading rhetoric which now obfuscates debate, thereby permitting this and other genocides to continue. . .\" --A. Clare Brandabur, Purdue University<br /><br />\"Churchill paints the whole picture here - from Columbus onwards, the major and significant struggles between an ignorant but brutal Conquistadores and the all-too-vulnerable American Tribes are analysed in a context of deliberate genocide. In terms of effectiveness, it surpasses the holocaust delivered upon European Jewry by the Nazi's.\" --Schnews.org.uk<br /><br />Ward Churchill (enrolled Keetoowah Cherokee) is Professor of American Indian Studies with the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado-Boulder. A member of the American Indian Movement since 1972, he has been a leader of the Colorado chapter for the past fifteen years. Among his previous books have been <i>Fantasies of a Master Race, Struggle for the Land, Since Predator Came</i>, and <i>From a Native Son.</i><br /><br /><br />",

And ain\u2019t that a big enough majority in any town?\u201d \u2014Mark Twain</i><br /><br />Ross Thomas chose the quotation from <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> as the text of this post-World War II story as well as for the title. When Lucifer Dye is released after three months in a Hong Kong prison, debriefed, and handed a false passport, a new wardrobe, and a $20,000 check, his haughty control makes it clear that Dye\u2019s career with his country has been permanently terminated. But a good agent is always in demand, and just a few hours later Dye is being interviewed for a highly ingenious position. Victor Orcutt, although a not very good imitation of a British prewar gent, has creative talents of his own. He has his sights a small southern city, with the ordinary run-of-the-mill corruption one would expect in such a place. The canny Orcott knows there\u2019s no profit in that. His creed is \u201cTo get better, it must be much worse.\u201d He and his two associates have looked up Dye\u2019s history, and he now offers the ex-spy a mission: For two and a half times the government\u2019s bounty, Dye is to thoroughly corrupt the town. And the sly Dye takes the offer.",

It's a small town, and Stephen King fans might think they know its secrets pretty well; they've been here before.<br /><br />Leland Gaunt is a stranger -- and he calls his shop Needful Things. Eleven-year-old Brain Rusk is his first customer, and Brian finds just what he wants most in all the world; a '56 Sandy Koufax baseball card. By the end of the week, Mr. Gaunt's business is fairly booming, and why not? At Needful Things, there's something for everyone.<br /><br />And, of course, there is always a price. For Leland Gaunt, the pleasure of doing business lies chiefly in seeing how much people will pay for their most secret dreams and desires. And as Leland Gaunt always points out, at Needful Things, the prices are high indeed. Does that stop people from buying? Has it ever?<br /><br />For Alan and Polly, this one week in autumn will be an awful test -- a test of will, desire, and pain. Above all, it will be a test of their ability to grasp the true nature of their enemy. They may have a chance . . . But maybe not, because, as Mr. Gaunt knows, almost everything is for sale: love, hope, even the human soul.<br /><br />With the potent storytelling authority that millions of readers have come to prize, Stephen King delivers an Out Town with a vengeance, an inimitable farewell to a place his fiction has often and long called home.",

In <i>To the Nines</i>, her cousin Vinnie (who's also her boss) has posted bail on Samuel Singh, an illegal immigrant. When the elusive Mr. Singh goes missing, Stephanie is on the case. But what she uncovers is far more sinister than anyone imagines and leads to a group of killers who give new meaning to the word hunter.<br /><br />In a race against time that takes her from the Jersey Turnpike to the Vegas Strip, Stephanie Plum is on the chase of her life. The unforgettable characters, nonstop action, high-stakes suspense, and sheer entertainment of <i>To the Nines </i>define Janet Evanovich as unique among today's writers.",

In Stephanie's opinion, toxic waste, rabid drivers, armed schizophrenics, and August heat, humidity, and hydrocarbons are all part of the great adventure of living in Jersey. She's a product of blue-collar Trenton, where houses are attached and narrow, cars are American, windows are clean, and dinner is served at six.\n    \n    Out of work and out of money, with her Miata repossessed and her refrigerator empty, Stephanie blackmails her bail bondsman cousin, Vinnie, into giving her a try as an apprehension agent. And that\u2019s only the beginning of series that will set her on the trail of fugitives. Stephanie will have to sharpen her sleuthing skills, because she's got many a mystery to solve. \n    \n    See also the related <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/43440-a-stephanie-plum-between-the-numbers-holiday-novel\">Between the Numbers Holiday novels</a> and the spinoff <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/49600-the-unmentionables\">Lizzy & Diesel</a> series.\n    \n    Please note: Each book in this series is a whole story with a beginning and an ending, however there may be minor references to events that occurred earlier in the series. Therefore, with respect to the mystery alone, the books can be read out of order, if desired. However, like any long series that focuses on a core group of characters, there are various relationship changes that develop more naturally when the full length novels are read in the order in which they were published.\n    \n    http://us.macmillan.com/series/StephaniePlumNovels",

    "description": "<b>Hannah Arendt's definitive work on totalitarianism and an essential component of any study of twentieth-century political history</b><br /><br /><i>The Origins of Totalitarianism</i> begins with the rise of anti-Semitism in central and western Europe in the 1800s and continues with an examination of European colonial imperialism from 1884 to the outbreak of World War I. Arendt explores the institutions and operations of totalitarian movements, focusing on the two genuine forms of totalitarian government in our time\u2014Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia\u2014which she adroitly recognizes were two sides of the same coin, rather than opposing philosophies of Right and Left. From this vantage point, she discusses the evolution of classes into masses, the role of propaganda in dealing with the nontotalitarian world, the use of terror, and the nature of isolation and loneliness as preconditions for total domination.",

    "description": "Since the series' inception in 1915, the annual volumes of The Best American Short Stories have launched literary careers, showcased the most compelling stories of each year, and confirmed for all time the significance of the short story in our national literature. Now THE BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES OF THE CENTURY brings together the best of the best - fifty-five extraordinary stories that represent a century's worth of unsurpassed accomplishments in this quintessentially American literary genre. Here are the stories that have endured the test of time: masterworks by such writers as Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, Willa Cather, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Saroyan, Flannery O'Connor, John Cheever, Eudora Welty, Philip Roth, Joyce Carol Oates, Raymond Carver, Cynthia Ozick, and scores of others. These are the writers who have shaped and defined the landscape of the American short story, who have unflinchingly explored all aspects of the human condition, and whose works will continue to speak to us as we enter the next century. Their artistry is represented splendidly in these pages. THE BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES series has also always been known for making literary discoveries, and discovery proved to be an essential part of selecting the stories for this volume too. Collections from years past yielded a rich harvest of surprises, stories that may have been forgotten but still retain their relevance and luster. The result is a volume that not only gathers some of the most significant stories of our century between two covers but resurrects a handful of lost literary gems as well. Of all the great writers whose work has appeared in the series, only John Updike's contributions have spanned five consecutive decades, from his first appearance, in 1959. Updike worked with coeditor Katrina Kenison to choose stories from each decade that meet his own high standards of literary quality.",

She has never forgotten the serial killer who wove lines of poetry in his hideous crimes--and apparently he has not forgotten her.<p>Former LAPD detective Harry Bosch gets a call, too--from the widow of an old friend. Her husband's death seems natural, but his ties to the hunt for the Poet make Bosch dig deep. Arriving at a derelict spot in the California desert where the feds are unearthing bodies, Bosch joins forces with Rachel. Now the two are at odds with the FBI...and squarely in the path of the Poet, who will lead them on a wicked ride out of the heat, through the narrows of evil, and into a darkness all his own...</p>",

    "description": "In <i>Cadillac Jack,</i> Larry McMurtry -- Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Lonesome Dove -- proves his unique talent for conjuring up the real, often eccentric people who inhabit the American heartland and for capturing the peculiarly American search for new frontiers and adventure. <br /><i>Cadillac Jack</i> is a rodeo-cowboy-turned-antique-scout whose nomadic, womanizing life -- centered on his classic pearl-colored Cadillac -- rambles between the Texas flatlands of flea markets and small-time auctions and Washington, D.C.'s political-social life of parties, hustlers, vixens, and spies. Along the way he meets a cast of indelibly etched characters: among them, the strikingly beautiful, social-climbing Cindy Sanders; Boog Miller, the tackily-dressing millionaire good ole boy who patronizes Jack's business and who has more political muscle than a litter of lobbyists; Khaki Descartes, the pushy, brain-picking, Washington woman reporter; Freddy Fu, an undercover CIA agent working out of a greasy barbecue joint called The Cover-Up; and Jean Arber, the mother of two and a fledgling antique-store owner who can't quite figure out if she'll marry Jack or not. <br /> Wild, touching, and hilariously funny, <i>Cadillac Jack</i> is Larry McMurtry's raucous social satire of sex, politics, and love in the fast lane, peopled with Americans only he could render.",

    "description": "More commonly known as <em>The Hunchback of Notre-Dame</em>, Victor Hugo\u2019s Romantic novel of dark passions and unrequited love<br /><br />In the vaulted Gothic towers of Notre-Dame Cathedral lives Quasimodo, the hunchbacked bellringer. Mocked and shunned for his appearance, he is pitied only by Esmerelda, a beautiful gypsy dancer to whom he becomes completely devoted. Esmerelda, however, has also attracted the attention of the sinister archdeacon Claude Frollo, and when she rejects his lecherous approaches, Frollo hatches a plot to destroy her, that only Quasimodo can prevent. Victor Hugo\u2019s sensational, evocative novel brings life to the medieval Paris he loved, and mourns its passing in one of the greatest historical romances of the nineteenth century. <br /><br />John Sturrock\u2019s clear, contemporary translation is accompanied by an introduction discussing it as a passionate novel of ideas, written in defence of Gothic architecture and of a burgeoning democracy, and demonstrating that an ugly exterior can conceal moral beauty. This revised edition also includes further reading and a chronology of Hugo\u2019s life.",

    "description": "The classic personal account of Watson and Crick\u2019s groundbreaking discovery of the structure of DNA, now with an introduction by Sylvia Nasar, author of <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>.<br /><br />By identifying the structure of DNA, the molecule of life, Francis Crick and James Watson revolutionized biochemistry and won themselves a Nobel Prize. At the time, Watson was only twenty-four, a young scientist hungry to make his mark. His uncompromisingly honest account of the heady days of their thrilling sprint against other world-class researchers to solve one of science\u2019s greatest mysteries gives a dazzlingly clear picture of a world of brilliant scientists with great gifts, very human ambitions, and bitter rivalries.<br /><br />With humility unspoiled by false modesty, Watson relates his and Crick\u2019s desperate efforts to beat Linus Pauling to the Holy Grail of life sciences, the identification of the basic building block of life. Never has a scientist been so truthful in capturing in words the flavor of his work.",

'I have reviewed your tax records back to 1945 and you show no large income, in any year. This would suggest that you could not legally afford such expenditures...'

Now the acclaimed author turns to World War I, bringing to life the sweeping, emotional story of the war that devastated a generation and established America as a world power.</blockquote>Spring 1916: the horror of a stalemate on Europe\u2019s western front. France and Great Britain are on one side of the barbed wire, a fierce German army is on the other. Shaara opens the window onto the otherworldly tableau of trench warfare as seen through the eyes of a typical British soldier who experiences the bizarre and the horrible\u2013a \u201cTommy\u201d whose innocent youth is cast into the hell of a terrifying war.<p>In the skies, meanwhile, technology has provided a devastating new tool, the aeroplane, and with it a different kind of hero emerges\u2013the flying ace. Soaring high above the chaos on the ground, these solitary knights duel in the splendor and terror of the skies, their courage and steel tested with every flight.</p><p>As the conflict stretches into its third year, a neutral America is goaded into war, its reluctant president, Woodrow Wilson, finally accepting the repeated challenges to his stance of nonalignment. Yet the Americans are woefully unprepared and ill equipped to enter a war that has become worldwide in scope. The responsibility is placed on the shoulders of General John \u201cBlackjack\u201d Pershing, and by mid-1917 the first wave of the American Expeditionary Force arrives in Europe. Encouraged by the bold spirit and strength of the untested Americans, the world waits to see if the tide of war can finally be turned.</p><p></p><blockquote>From Blackjack Pershing to the Marine in the trenches, from the Red Baron to the American pilots of the Lafayette Escadrille, <i>To the Last Man</i> is written with the moving vividness and accuracy that characterizes all of Shaara\u2019s work. This spellbinding new novel carries readers\u2013the way only Shaara can\u2013to the heart of one of the greatest conflicts in human history, and puts them face-to-face with the characters who made a lasting impact on the world.</blockquote>",

    "description": "Jeff Shaara dazzled readers with his bestselling novels <i>Gods</i> <i>and Generals, </i> <i>The Last Full Measure</i>, and <i>Gone for Soldiers</i>. Now the acclaimed author who illuminated the Civil War and the Mexican-American War brilliantly brings to life the American Revolution, creating a superb saga of the men who helped to forge the destiny of a nation.<br /><br />In 1770, the fuse of revolution is lit by a fateful command--\"Fire!\"--as England's peacekeeping mission ignites into the Boston Massacre. The senseless killing of civilians leads to a tumultuous trial in which lawyer John Adams must defend the very enemy who has assaulted and abused the laws he holds sacred.<br /><br />The taut courtroom drama soon broadens into a stunning epic of war as King George III leads a reckless and corrupt government in London toward the escalating abuse of his colonies. Outraged by the increasing loss of their liberties, an extraordinary gathering of America's most inspiring characters confronts the British presence with the ideals that will change history.<br /><br />John Adams, the idealistic attorney devoted to the law, who rises to greatness by the power of his words . . . Ben Franklin, one of the most celebrated men of his time, the elderly and audacious inventor and philosopher who endures firsthand the hostile prejudice of the British government . . . Thomas Gage, the British general given the impossible task of crushing a colonial rebellion without starting an all-out war . . . George Washington, the dashing Virginian whose battle experience in the French and Indian War brings him the recognition that elevates him to command of a colonial army . . . and many other immortal names from the Founding Family of the colonial struggle--Abigail Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Joseph Warren, Samuel Adams, Richard Henry Lee-- captured as never before in their full flesh-and-blood humanity.<br /><br />More than a powerful portrait of the people and purpose of the revolution, <i>Rise to Rebellion</i> is a vivid account of history's most pivotal events. The Boston Tea Party, the battles of Concord and Bunker Hill--all are recreated with the kind of breathtaking detail only a master like Jeff Shaara can muster. His most impressive achievement, <i>Rise to Rebellion</i> reveals with new immediacy how philosophers became fighters, ideas their ammunition, and how a scattered group of colonies became the United States of America.<br /><br />Length: 6 hrs and 1 min",

    "description": "In the Pulitzer prize-winning classic <i>The Killer Angels, </i> Michael Shaara created the finest Civil War novel of our time. In the bestselling <i>Gods and Generals, </i> Shaara's son, Jeff, brilliantly sustained his father's vision, telling the epic story of the events culminating in the Battle of Gettysburg. Now, Jeff Shaara brings this legendary father-son trilogy to its stunning conclusion in a novel that brings to life the final two years of the Civil War.<br /><br />As <i>The Last Full Measure</i> opens, Gettysburg is past and the war advances to its third brutal year. On the Union side, the gulf between the politicians in Washington and the generals in the field yawns ever wider. Never has the cumbersome Union Army so desperately needed a decisive, hard-nosed leader. It is at this critical moment that Lincoln places Ulysses S. Grant in command--and turns the tide of war.<br /><br />For Robert E. Lee, Gettysburg was an unspeakable disaster--compounded by the shattering loss of the fiery Stonewall Jackson two months before. Lee knows better than anyone that the South cannot survive a war of attrition. But with the total devotion of his generals--Longstreet, Hill, Stuart--and his unswerving faith in God, Lee is determined to fight to the bitter end.<br /><br />Here too is Joshua Chamberlain, the college professor who emerged as the Union hero of Gettysburg--and who will rise to become one of the greatest figures of the Civil War.<br /><br />Battle by staggering battle, Shaara dramatizes the escalating confrontation between Lee and Grant--complicated, heroic, deeply troubled men. From the costly Battle of the Wilderness to the agonizing siege of Petersburg to Lee's epoch-making surrender at Appomattox, Shaara portrays the riveting conclusion of the Civil War through the minds and hearts of the individuals who gave their last full measure.<br /><br />Full of human passion and the spellbinding truth of history, <i>The Last Full Measure</i> is the fitting capstone to a magnificent literary trilogy.<br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "<b>For the first time, the full story of what happened when Frank brought his best pals to party in a land called Vegas<br /><br /></b>January 1960. Las Vegas is at its smooth, cool peak. The Strip is a jet-age theme park, and the greatest singer in the history of American popular music summons a group of friends there to make a movie. One is an insouciant singer of Italian songs, ex-partner to the most popular film comedian of the day. One is a short, black, Jewish, one-eyed, singing, dancing wonder. One is an upper-crust British pretty boy turned degenerate B-movie star actor, brother-in-law to an ascendant politician. And one is a stiff-shouldered comic with the quintessential Borscht Belt emcee\u2019s knack for needling one-liners. The architectonically sleek marquee of the Sands Hotel announces their presence simply by listing their names: FRANK SINATRA. DEAN MARTIN. SAMMY DAVIS, JR. PETER LAWFORD. JOEY BISHOP. Around them an entire cast gathers: actors, comics, singers, songwriters, gangsters, politicians, and women, as well as thousands of starstruck everyday folks who fork over pocketfuls of money for the privilege of basking in their presence. They call themselves The Clan. But to an awed world, they are known as The Rat Pack.<br /><br />They had it all. Fame. Gorgeous women. A fabulouse playground of a city and all the money in the world. The backing of fearsome crime lords and the blessing of the President of the United States. But the dark side\u2013over the thin line between pleasure and debauchery, between swinging self-confidence and brutal arrogance\u2013took its toll. In four years, their great ride was over, and showbiz was never the same. <br /><br />Acclaimed Jerry Lewis biographer Shawn Levy has written a dazzling portrait of a time when neon brightness cast sordid shadows. It was Frank\u2019s World, and we just lived in it.",

    "description": "On October 3, 1993, about a hundred U.S. soldiers were dropped by helicopter into a teeming market in the heart of Mogadishu, Somalia, to abduct two top lieutenants of a Somali warlord. The action was supposed to take an hour. Instead, they spent a long and terrible night fighting thousands of armed Somalis. By morning, eighteen Americans were dead, and more than seventy badly injured. Mark Bowden's gripping narrative is one of the most exciting accounts of modern war ever written--a riveting story that captures the heroism, courage and brutality of battle.",

    "description": "<i>In Conquest Born</i> is the monumental science fiction epic that received unprecedented acclaim-and launched C.S. Friedman's phenomenal career. A sweeping story of two interstellar civilizations-locked in endless war, it was nominated for the John W. Campbell Award.<br /><br /><i>From the back cover:</i><br /><br />Braxi and Azea - two interstellar civilizations fighting an endless war over a long-forgotten cause; two peoples descended from the human species and bred over countless generations to embody opposing ideals, seeking opposite paths to power.<br /><br />The Braxana - dominant tribe of the fierce Braxin Holding - are brilliant, powerful, and aloof from the society they rule. They were bred by their primitive forebearers to be aggressive, competitive, and secretive beyond all prior human norms. The mysteries of their internal society are legendary even among the people they rule.<br /><br />The Azeans - masters of genetic science - have redesigned their own race to reflect ancient ideals. Now they seek to unlock the powers of the human mind, using telepathy to penetrate where mere weapons cannot.<br /><br />But Zatar and Anzha - master Braxana and Azean generals - have exceeded all genetic expectations of their opposed cultures, and have made this endless war a personal vendetta. Who can say what will happen when these ultimate warriors use every power of mind and body to claim the vengeance of total conquest?",

    "description": "For hundreds of years, Earth has suffered under the yoke of alien conquerors: the dreaded Tyr, a reptilian race in which all individuality is submerged into a single, overarching consciousness. Determined to keep humanity cowed, the Tyr have culled from the captive population the most intelligent, the most curious, the most likely to foment rebellion, and banished them from Earth. As the memory of freedom recedes, humanity sinks into a lethargic subservience. Daetrin, the hero of this tale, is a vampire--not a monster, however, but a man, nearly immortal, who embodies the vanished virtues of a once-sovereign Earth. When his existence is exposed by the Tyr, who are appalled to find a human who witnessed the Conquest, they immediately ship him offworld. Thus begins a journey of self-discovery as Daetrin is forced by adversity to come to grips with the long-suppressed side of his nature and to confront the ancient horror of a bloody heritage.",

    "description": "The novel opens with Barbara, who, after remembering incidents of torture at the hands of her father, has quite literally broken down. Found inside a disabled elevator, she is no longer able to function with her new consciousness of these memories\u2014those which are so resistant to understanding. Confronted with this knowledge of evil, she must begin the painful process of remembering and reconstructing a new whole self.<br /><br />Helping Barbara to navigate her grief and her memories are her therapist, the Psalms, and most of all, the words of Paul Celan. Paul Celan: 1920-1970, Poet. An eastern European holocaust survivor who wrote haunting poems about the darker spiritual trials of life and relationships that exhibit a compact style that fuses broken words and chopped syntax to produce a stark musicality.<br /><br />This is a novel about a woman who goes to hell and back. It\u2019s a story which affirms the resilience of the human spirit and the healing power of love and faith.<br />",

    "description": "\"Hit and Run\" tells the improbable and often hilarious story of how two Hollywood film packagers went on a campaign to reinvent themselves as studio executives-- at Sony's expense. Veteran reporters Nancy Griffin and Kim Masters chronicle the rise of Jon Peters, a former hairdresser, seventh-grade dropout, and juvenile delinquent, and his soulless soul mate, Peter Guber-- and all the sex, drugs, and fistfights along the way. It is the story of the ultimate Hollywood con job and the standard by which every subsequent business blunder has been measured. \"Hit and Run\" delivers rock-solid business reporting liberally laced with inside gossip and outrageous scandal-- plus a new afterword bringing us up to date on the latest fallout from the Guber-Peters legacy.",

    "description": "<b>\"A definitive portrait of the madness of big-time moviemaking.\"--<i>Newsweek</i></b><br /><br />When Brian De Palma agreed to allow Julie Salamon unlimited access to the film production of Tom Wolfe's best-selling book <i>The Bonfire of the Vanities</i>, both director and journalist must have felt like they were on to something big. How could it lose? But instead Salamon got a front-row seat at the Hollywood disaster of the decade. She shadowed the film from its early stages through the last of the eviscerating reviews, and met everyone from the actors to the technicians to the studio executives. They'd all signed on for a blockbuster, but there was a sense of impending doom from the start--heart-of-gold characters replaced Wolfe's satiric creations; affable Tom Hanks was cast as the patrician heel; Melanie Griffith appeared mid-shoot with new, bigger breasts. With a keen eye and ear, Salamon shows us how the best of intentions turned into a legendary Hollywood debacle.<br /><i>The Devil's Candy</i> joins John Gregory Dunne's <i>The Studio,</i> Steven Bach's <i>Final Cut,</i> and William Goldman's <i>Adventures in the Screen Trade</i> as a classic for anyone interested in the workings of Hollywood. With a new afterword profiling De Palma ten years after the movie's devastating flop (and this book's best-selling publication), Julie Salamon has created a riveting insider's portrait of an industry where art, talent, ego, and money combine and clash on a monumental scale.<br /><b>\"Delightful. <i>The Devil's Candy</i> is quite simply the most telling examination of moviemaking since Lillian Ross's [<i>Picture</i>]. . . . One must be thankful to the filmmakers for producing such a spectacle, if only so that this book could be written.\"--Graydon Carter, <i>Vogue</i></b><br />",

    "description": "In Hollywood, screenwriters are a curse to be borne, and beating up on them is an industry blood sport. But in this ferociously funny and accurate account of life on the Hollywood food chain, it's a screenwriter who gets the last murderous laugh. That may be because the writer is John Gregory Dunne, who has written screenplays, along with novels and non-fiction, for thirty years. In 1988 Dunne and his wife, Joan Didion, were asked to write a screenplay about the dark and complicated life of the late TV anchorwoman Jessica Savitch. Eight years and twenty-seven drafts later, this script was made into the fairy tale \"Up Close and Personal\" starring Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer. Detailing the meetings, rewrites, fights, firings, and distractions attendant to the making of a single picture, <b>Monster</b> illuminates the process with sagacity and raucous wit.",

    "description": "Years ago, when <b>House of Leaves</b> was first being passed around, it was nothing more than a badly bundled heap of paper, parts of which would occasionally surface on the Internet. No one could have anticipated the small but devoted following this terrifying story would soon command. Starting with an odd assortment of marginalized youth -- musicians, tattoo artists, programmers, strippers, environmentalists, and adrenaline junkies -- the book eventually made its way into the hands of older generations, who not only found themselves in those strangely arranged pages but also discovered a way back into the lives of their estranged children.<br /><br />Now, for the first time, this astonishing novel is made available in book form, complete with the original colored words, vertical footnotes, and newly added second and third appendices.<br /><br />The story remains unchanged, focusing on a young family that moves into a small home on Ash Tree Lane where they discover something is terribly wrong: their house is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.<br /><br />Of course, neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was prepared to face the consequences of that impossibility, until the day their two little children wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story -- of creature darkness, of an ever-growing abyss behind a closet door, and of that unholy growl which soon enough would tear through their walls and consume all their dreams.",

Sharon now hints that he desperately needs help, but Alex evades her. The next day she is dead, an apparent suicide. Driven by guilt and sadness, Alex plunges into the maze of Sharon's life--a journey that will take him through the pleasure palaces of California's ultra-rich, into the dark closets of a family's disturbing past, and finally into the alleyways of the mind, where childhood terrors still hold sway.",

Over the course of the following years, he manages to establish himself as a respected and prosperous pillar of the community of Casterbridge, but behind his success there always lurk the shameful secret of his past and a personality prone to self-destructive pride and temper. Subtitled \u2018A Story of a Man of Character\u2019, Hardy\u2019s powerful and sympathetic study of the heroic but deeply flawed Henchard is also an intensely dramatic work, tragically played out against the vivid backdrop of a close-knit Dorsetshire town.<br /><br />This edition includes an introduction, chronology of Hardy\u2019s life and works, the illustrations for the original Serial Issue, place names, maps, glossary, full explanatory notes as well as Hardy\u2019s prefaces to the 1895 and 1912 editions.",

With skillful prose, he enthralls even as he horrifies; with uncanny insight, he disturbs as profoundly as he reveals. Evoking revulsion and admiration, anticipation and dread, Barker's works explore the darkest contradictions of the human condition: our fear of life and our dreams of death.",

From its first English language publication in 1985 it has been recognized as a classic of political engagement, original research, and literary form.<br /><br />\u201cMemory of Fire is devastating, triumphant... sure to scorch the sensibility of English-language readers.\u201d (New York Times)<br /><br />\u201cAn epic work of literary creation... there could be no greater vindication of the wonders of the lands and people of Latin America than Memory of Fire.\u201d (Washington Post)<br /><br />\u201c[Memory of Fire] will reveal to you the meaning of the New World as it was, and of the world as we have it now.\u201d (Boston Globe)<br /><br />\u201cA book as fascinating as the history it relates.... Galeano is a satirist, realist, and historian, and... deserves mention alongside John Dos Passos, Bernard DeVoto, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez.\u201d (Los Angeles Times)",

Holmes, master of disguise, reasoned logically to deduce clients' background from their first appearance. He used fingerprints, chemical analysis, and forensic science.\n    \n    The majority of the stories were first published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>  accumulated to four novels and fifty-six short stories set 1880-1914.\n    \n    All but four stories are narrated by Holmes's friend and biographer, Dr John H. Watson; two are narrated by Holmes himself (<i>The Blanched Soldier</i> and <i>The Lion's Mane</i>) and two others are written in the third person (<i>The Mazarin Stone</i> and <i>His Last Bow</i>). In two stories (<i>The Musgrave Ritual</i> and <i>The Gloria Scott</i>), Holmes tells Watson the main story from his memories, while Watson becomes the narrator of the frame story. The first and fourth novels, <i>A Study in Scarlet</i> and <i>The Valley of Fear</i>, each include long omniscient narration of events unknown to Holmes or Watson.",

    "description": "Rarely in recent times has a voice so captured the imagination of critics and readers everywhere as John Irving in his internationally acclaimed novel <i>The World According to Garp</i>.<br /><br />In Mr. Irving's newest novel, <i>The Hotel New Hampshire</i>, the reader is again seduced by the unfolding of a singular world. As John Berry, the narrator and middle son in a family of five children (and one bear and a dog named Sorrow), explains: <i>We were a family whose favorite story was the story of my mother and father's romance: how my Father bought the bear, how Mother and Father fell in love and had, in rapid succession, Frank, Franny, and me ('Bang, Bang, Bang! as Franny would say); and, after a brief rest, how they then had Lilly and Egg ('Pop and Fizzle,' Franny says),\"</i><br /><br />That voice--at once nostalgic and direct--describes the Berry family growing up in three different hotels and on two separate continents. <i>\"The first of my father's illusions was that bears could survive the life lived by human beings, and the second was that human beings could survive a life led in hotels.\"</i> What happens to Father's dreams (and to the children upon whom those dreams are visited) is the subject of John Irving's fifth and finest novel.",

    "description": "John Galardi is a loner, unable to express his feelings except in the pages of his zine, \"Bananafish.\" He finds inspiration in another zine, \"Escape Velocity,\" created by Marisol Guzman, a self-proclaimed \"rich spoiled lesbian private-school gifted-and-talented writer virgin.\" Her sharp observations make John laugh out loud and he decides he must meet this witty author. By planting himself in Tower Records the day she drops off the latest issue, John manages to arrange a coffee date that extends over several Saturday mornings. They discuss everything from John's inability to feel and his parent's divorce to Marisol's problems with her suffocating adoptive parents. When Marisol casually tells John that she likes him, he is flabbergasted: \"Honest to God a shiver ran through my body... Nobody ever said that they liked me. Ever. Not even [my friend] Brian, who probably actually doesn't.\" After a disastrous \"just friends\" junior prom date and a weekend zine conference spent together, John realizes that his feelings for Marisol are more than platonic. And Marisol, who is exploring her identity as a young lesbian, has no idea how to let John down gently without losing her new best friend.",

    "description": "Charley is an athlete. He wants to be painted crossing the finish line, in his racing silks, with a medal around his neck. But Charley isn't a runner. He is a human mount, the property of one of the alien invaders called Hoots. Charley hasn't seen his mother in years, and his father is hiding out in the mountains with the other Free Humans. The Hoots own the world, but the humans want it back. Charley knows how to be a good mount-now he's going to have to learn how to be a human being. This remarkable novel, winner of the 2002 Philip K. Dick Award, should be read by every fan of speculative fiction, teenagers and adults alike.",

    "description": "All Too Human is a new-generation political memoir, written from the refreshing perspective of one who got his hands on the levers of awesome power at an early age. At thirty, the author was at Bill Clinton's side during the presidential campaign of 1992, &amp; for the next five years he was rarely more than a step away from the president &amp; his other advisers at every important moment of the first term. What Liar's Poker did to Wall Street, this book will do to politics. It is an irreverent &amp; intimate portrait of how the nation's weighty business is conducted by people whose egos &amp; idiosyncrasies are no sturdier than anyone else's. Including sharp portraits of the Clintons, Al Gore, Dick Morris, Colin Powell, &amp; scores of others, as well as candid &amp; revelatory accounts of the famous debacles &amp; triumphs of an administration that constantly went over the top, All Too Human is, like its author, a brilliant combination of pragmatic insight &amp; idealism. It is destined to be the most important &amp; enduring book to come out of the Clinton administration.",

    "description": "Lily Ellsworth--erect, firm, white-haired, and stylish--is the grand dame of Dowling, Massachusetts, and possesses an iron will and a bottomless purse. When she hires Spenser to investigate her grandson Jared Clark's alleged involvement in a school shooting, Spenser is led into an inquiry that grows more harrowing at every turn. Though seven people were killed in cold blood, and despite Jared's being named as a co-conspirator by the other shooter, Mrs. Ellsworth is convinced of her grandson's innocence. Jared's parents are resigned to his fate, and the boy himself doesn't seem to care whether he goes to prison for a crime he might not have committed. <br />As the probe goes on, Spenser finds himself up against a number of roadblocks--from the school officials who don't want him asking questions, to Jared's own parents, who are completely indifferent to the boy's defense. Ultimately, Spenser discovers a web of blackmail and some heavy-duty indiscretions--and a truth too disturbing to contemplate. Before the case reaches its unfortunate end, he is forced to make a series of difficult decisions--with fatal consequences. \"From the Compact Disc edition.\"",

Just one of the many sordid domestic crimes hitting the city.<br /><br />Tony Macliesh, her rejected boyfriend, is the obvious prime suspect and he's just been picked off the Aberdeen train and put straight into custody. But then another women is sexually abused and throttled to death. And suddenly there appears to be one too many connections between these seemingly unrelated crimes.<br /><br />Because Detective Inspector Resnick is sure that the two murders are the work of one sadistic killer - two lonely hearts broken by one maniac. And it's up to Resnick to put the record straight - and put the bastard where he belongs.",

    "description": "<p>How does an honor student at one of Los Angeles's finest prep schools--a nice girl from a happy, loving home--trade school uniforms and afternoons at the mall for speedballs in the back of a truck in rural Indiana? How does her devoted mother emerge from the shock of finding that her daughter has not only disappeared but had been living a secret life for more than a year? </p><p> Mother and daughter tell their parallel stories in mesmerizing first\u2013person accounts. Claire Fontaine's story is a parent's worst nightmare, a cautionary tale chronicling her daughter Mia's drug\u2013fueled manipulation of everyone around her as she sought refuge in the seedy underworld of felons and heroin addicts, the painful childhood secrets that led up to it, and the healing that followed. Her search for Mia was brutal for both mother and daughter, a dizzying series of dead ends, incredible coincidences and, at times, miracles. Ultimately, Mia was forced into harsh but loving boot-camp schools on two continents while Claire entered a painful but life\u2013changing program of her own. Mia's story includes the jarring culture shock of the extreme and controversial behavior modification school she was in for nearly two years, which helped her overcome depression and self\u2013hatred to emerge a powerful young woman with self\u2013esteem and courage. </p><p> <i>Come Back</i> is an unforgettable story of love and transformation that will resonate with mothers and daughters everywhere.</p>",

    "description": "One of the world's greatest novelists, Leo Tolstoy (1828\u20131910) also wrote numerous excellent short stories, three of which are contained in this volume. \"The Kreutzer Sonata\" (1891) is a penetrating study of jealousy as well as a splenetic complaint about the way in which society educates young men and women in matters of sex. In \"The Death of Ivan Ilych\" (1886), a symbolic Everyman discovers the inner light of faith and love only when confronted by death. \"How Much Land Does a Man Need?\" (1886) is a simple, didactic story of peasant life, written by Tolstoy in the wake of a spiritual crisis. All three tales offer readers a splendid introduction to Tolstoy's work as well as the focused delights of the short story form brought to a pinnacle in the hands of a master.<br /><br />",

Fresh-mouthed and free-spirited, the irrepressible Madame Esm\u00e9\u2014as she prefers to be called\u2014does the cha-cha during multiplication tables, roller-skates down the hallways, and puts on rousing performances with at-risk students in the library. Her diary opens a window into a real-life classroom from a teacher\u2019s perspective. While battling bureaucrats, gang members, abusive parents, and her own insecurities, this gifted young woman reveals what it takes to be an exceptional teacher.\u00a0 <br /><br />Heroine to thousands of parents and educators, Esm\u00e9 now shares more of her ingenious and yet down-to-earth approaches to the classroom in a supplementary guide to help new teachers hit the ground running. As relevant and iconoclastic as when it was first published, <i>Educating Esm\u00e9</i> is a classic, as is Madame Esm\u00e9 herself.",

    "description": "Ranked among the classic novels of the English language and the inspiration for several unforgettable movies, this early work of H. G. Wells was greeted in 1896 by howls of protest from reviewers, who found it horrifying and blasphemous. They wanted to know more about the wondrous possibilities of science shown in his first book, <i>The Time Machine</i>, not its potential for misuse and terror. In <i>The Island of Dr. Moreau</i>, a shipwrecked gentleman named Edward Prendick, stranded on a Pacific island lorded over by the notorious Dr. Moreau, confronts dark secrets, strange creatures, and a reason to run for his life.<br /><br />While this riveting tale was intended to be a commentary on evolution, divine creation, and the tension between human nature and culture, modern readers familiar with genetic engineering will marvel at Wells\u2019s prediction of the ethical issues raised by producing \u201csmarter\u201d human beings or bringing back extinct species. These levels of interpretation add a richness to Prendick\u2019s adventures on Dr. Moreau\u2019s island of lost souls without distracting from what is still a rip-roaring good read.",

Lovecraft remade the horror genre in the early twentieth century, discarding ghosts and witches and instead envisaging mankind at the mercy of a chaotic and malevolent universe.<br /><br />This selection of stories ranges from early tales of nightmares and insanity such as 'The Outsider' and 'The Rats in the Walls', through the grotesquely comic 'Herbert West \u2013 Reanimator' and 'The Hound', to the extra-terrestrial terror of 'The Call of Cthulhu', which fuses traditional supernaturalism with science fiction. Including the definitive corrected texts, this collection reveals the development of Lovecraft's mesmerizing narrative style and establishes him as a hugely influential \u2013 and visionary \u2013 American writer.",

Lynley, the eighth earl of Asherton, has brought to Howenstow, his family home, the young woman he has asked to be his bride. But the savage murder of a local journalist is the catalyst for a lethal series of events that shatters the calm of a picturesque Cornwall village and embroils Lynley and St. James in a case far outside their jurisdiction\u2014and a little too close to home. When a second death follows closely on the heels of the first, Lynley finds he can't help taking the investigation personally\u2014because the evidence points to a killer within his own family.",

    "description": "\"A passionate, lyrical, tough-minded account of an extraordinary life in art, revolution, and love. It's a book to relish, to read and re-read. Unforgettable.\" --Salmon Rushdie<br /><br />An electrifying memoir from the acclaimed Nicaraguan writer (\"A wonderfully free and original talent\"--Harold Pinter) and central figure in the Sandinista Revolution.<br /><br />Until her early twenties, Gioconda Belli inhabited an upper-class cocoon: sheltered from the poverty in Managua in a world of country clubs and debutante balls; educated abroad; early marriage and motherhood. But in 1970, everything changed. Her growing dissatisfaction with domestic life, and a blossoming awareness of the social inequities in Nicaragua, led her to join the Sandinistas, then a burgeoning but still hidden organization. She would be involved with them over the next twenty years at the highest, and often most dangerous, levels.<br /><br />Her memoir is both a revelatory insider's account of the Revolution and a vivid, intensely felt story about coming of age under extraordinary circumstances. Belli writes with both striking lyricism and candor about her personal and political lives: about her family, her children, the men in her life; about her poetry; about the dichotomies between her birth-right and the life she chose for herself; about the failures and triumphs of the Revolution; about her current life, divided between California (with her American husband and their children) and Nicaragua; and about her sustained and sustaining passion for her country and its people.",

    "description": "NATIONAL BESTSELLER<br /><br />\"[A]n extraordinary book, a work of staggering virtuosity. With its publication, a giant world of literature has just grown twice as tall.\"--<i>Newsday</i><br /><br />From Ralph Ellison--author of the classic novel of African-American experience, <b>Invisible Man</b>--the long-awaited second novel. Here is the master of American vernacular--the rhythms of jazz and gospel and ordinary speech--at the height of his powers, telling a powerful, evocative tale of a prodigal of the twentieth century.<br /><br />\"Tell me what happened while there's still time,\" demands the dying Senator Adam Sunraider to the itinerate Negro preacher whom he calls Daddy Hickman. As a young man, Sunraider was Bliss, an orphan taken in by Hickman and raised to be a preacher like himself. Bliss's history encompasses the joys of young southern boyhood; bucolic days as a filmmaker, lovemaking in a field in the Oklahoma sun. And behind it all lies a mystery: how did this chosen child become the man who would deny everything to achieve his goals? Brilliantly crafted, moving, wise, <b>Juneteenth</b> is the work of an American master.",

Sarah's struggle towards independence and self-fulfillment resonates with a passion all can share. Beautifully redesigned page for page with the previous editions, <em>Bread Givers</em> is an essential historical work with enduring relevance.",

His wife is restless; his teenaged children are troubled and discontented, hungry for the tantalising material comforts he cannot provide. Then one day, in a moment of moral crisis, Ethan decides to take a holiday from his own scrupulous standards.<br /><br />The Nobel Committee, in awarding John Steinbeck the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature, stated that with The Winter of Our Discontent he had \"resumed his position as an independent expounder of the truth, with an unbiased instinct for what is genuinely American.\"",

    "description": "Without knowing it, Americans eat genetically modified (GM) food everyday. While the food and chemical industries claim that GMO food is safe, a considerable amount of evidence shows otherwise. In <em>Seeds of Deception</em>, Jeffrey Smith, a former executive with the leading independent laboratory testing for GM presence in foods, documents these serious health dangers and explains how corporate influence and government collusion have been used to cover them up.<br /><br />The stories Smith presents read like a mystery novel. Scientists are offered bribes or threatened; evidence is stolen; data withheld or distorted. Government scientists who complain are stripped of responsibilities or fired. The FDA even withheld information from congress after a GM food supplement killed nearly a hundred people and permanently disabled thousands. While Smith was employed by the laboratory he was not allowed to speak on the health dangers or the cover-up. No longer bound by this agreement, Smith now reveals what he knows in this groundbreaking expos'.<br /><br />Today, food companies sell GM foods that have not undergone safety studies. FDA scientists opposed this, but White House and industry pressure prevailed and the agency's final policy--co-authored by a former Monsanto attorney--denied the risks. The scientists' concerns were made public only after a lawsuit forced the agency to turn over internal documents.<br /><br />Dan Glickman, former Secretary of Agriculture, describes the government's pro-biotech mindset: \"You felt like you were almost an alien, disloyal, by trying to present an open-minded view. . . . So I pretty much spouted the rhetoric. . . . It was written into my speeches.\"<br /><br />In <em>Seeds of Deception</em> Smith offers easy-to-understand descriptions of genetic engineering and explains why it can result in serious health problems. This well-documented, pivotal work will show you how to protect yourself and your family.",

    "description": "A twentieth-century successor to Edgar Allan Poe as the master of \u201cweird fiction,\u201d Howard Philips Lovecraft once wrote, \u201cThe oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.\u201d In the novellas and stories he published in such pulp magazines as <em>Weird Tales</em> and <em>Astounding Stories</em>\u2014and in the work that remained unpublished until after his death, including some of his best writing\u2014H. P. Lovecraft adapted the conventions of horror stories and science fiction to express an intensely personal vision, cosmic in its ramifications and fearsome in its shuddering view of human destiny.<br /><br />In this <em>Library of America</em> volume, the best-selling novelist Peter Straub brings together the very best of Lovecraft\u2019s fiction in a treasury guaranteed to bring fright and delight both to longtime fans and to readers new to his work. Early stories such as \u201cThe Outsider,\u201d \u201cThe Music of Erich Zann,\u201d \u201cHerbert West\u2013Reanimator,\u201d and \u201cThe Lurking Fear\u201d demonstrate Lovecraft\u2019s uncanny ability to blur the distinction between reality and nightmare, sanity and madness, the human and non-human. \u201cThe Horror at Red Hook\u201d and \u201cHe\u201d reveal the fascination and revulsion Lovecraft felt for New York City; \u201cPickman\u2019s Model\u201d uncovers the frightening secret behind an artist\u2019s work; \u201cThe Rats in the Walls\u201d is a terrifying descent into atavistic horror; and \u201cThe Colour Out of Space\u201d explores the eerie impact of a meteorite on a remote Massachusetts valley.<br /><br />In such later works as \u201cThe Call of Cthulhu,\u201d \u201cThe Whisperer in Darkness,\u201d \u201cAt the Mountains of Madness,\u201d \u201cThe Shadow Over Innsmouth,\u201d and \u201cThe Shadow Out of Time,\u201d Lovecraft developed his own nightmarish mythology in which encounters with ancient, pitiless extraterrestrial intelligences wreak havoc on hapless humans who only gradually begin to glimpse \u201cterrifying vistas of reality, and our frightful position therein.\u201d Moving from old New England towns haunted by occult pasts to Antarctic wastes that disclose appalling secrets, Lovecraft\u2019s tales continue to exert a dread fascination.<br /><br /><u>Table of Contents:</u><br />The Statement of Randolph Carter<br />The Outsider<br />The Music of Erich Zann<br />Herbert West\u2014Reanimator<br />The Lurking Fear<br />The Rats in the Walls<br />The Shunned House<br />The Horror at Red Hook<br />He<br />Cool Air<br />The Call of Cthulhu<br />Pickman\u2019s Model<br />The Case of Charles Dexter Ward<br />The Colour Out of Space<br />The Dunwich Horror<br />The Whisperer in Darkness<br />At the Mountains of Madness<br />The Shadow Over Innsmouth<br />The Dreams in the Witch House<br />The Thing on the Doorstep<br />The Shadow Out of Time<br />The Haunter of the Dark",

Maggie is a meddler and as she and her husband, Ira, drive 90 miles to the funeral of an old friend, Ira contemplates his wasted life and the traffic, while Maggie hatches a plant to reunite her son Jesse with his long-estranged wife and baby. As Ira explains, \"She thinks the people she loves are better than they really are, and so then she starts changing things around to suit her view of them.\" Though everyone criticizes her for being \"ordinary,\" Maggie's ability to see the beauty and potential in others ultimately proves that she is the only one fighting the resignation they all fear. The book captured the Pulitzer Prize for literature in 1989.",

It's a\u00a0\u00a0wild, illuminating, sometimes shocking tale of sex,\u00a0\u00a0ambition, heartaches--and a life lived hard, fast,\u00a0\u00a0and without\u00a0\u00a0apologies.",

    "description": "<i>The Pixies</i> have had a career unlike any other in alternative rock,<br />disappearing as not-quite-the-next-big-things only to become gods in<br />absentia. Doolittle is their knotty masterpiece, the embodiment of the<br />Pixies abrasive, exuberant, enigmatic pop. Informed by exclusive<br />interviews with the band, Sisario looks at the making of the album and<br />its place in rock history, and studies its continued influence in light<br />of the Pixies triumphant reunion.",

Hendee's acclaimed Fantasy debut, comes <i>Thief of Lives</i>, the new novel featuring Magiere and Leesil, Slayers of the Undead...</b><br /><br />Magiere the dhampir thinks that her nights of hunting vampires are over. After settling down in her newly adopted village of Miiska \u2014 now vampire-free, thanks to her and her half-elf partner, Leesil \u2014 she looks forward to quiet days tending to her tavern.<br /><br />But far away in the capital city of Bela, a prominent councilman's daughter has been found dead on her own doorstep... and all signs point to a vampire. Knowing that the battered and burned village of Miiska could use an infusion of cash, Bela's town council offers a generous bounty to the dhampir if she will slay their vampire. Magiere resists, wanting nothing more than to forget her past and ignore her half-vampire nature. Only Leesil can persuade Magiere to follow her destiny \u2014 before more innocent lives are claimed by darkness.",

    "description": "<strong>The bestselling author of <em>Pledged</em></strong> returns with a groundbreaking look at the pressure to achieve faced by America's teens In <em>Pledged</em>, Alexandra Robbins followed four college girls to produce a riveting narrative that read like fiction. Now, in <em>The Overachievers</em>, Robbins uses the same captivating style to explore how our high-stakes educational culture has spiraled out of control. During the year of her ten-year reunion, Robbins goes back to her high school, where she follows heart-tuggingly likeable students including \"AP\" Frank, who grapples with horrifying parental pressure to succeed; Audrey, whose panicked perfectionism overshadows her life; Sam, who worries his years of overachieving will be wasted if he doesn't attend a name-brand college; Taylor, whose ambition threatens her popular girl status; and The Stealth Overachiever, a mystery junior who flies under the radar. Robbins tackles teen issues such as intense stress, the student and teacher cheating epidemic, sports rage, parental guilt, the black market for study drugs, and a college admissions process so cutthroat that students are driven to suicide and depression because of a B. With a compelling mix of fast-paced narrative and fascinating investigative journalism, <em>The Overachievers</em> aims both to calm the admissions frenzy and to expose its escalating dangers.",

But when five-year-old Ellie disappears, the fault lines within the family are exposed: Joseph, once a successful businessman, succumbs to his demons; Isabelle retreats into memories of her debutante days in Savannah; and Ellie's bereft sisters grow apart-Madeline reluctantly stays home, while Caroline runs away.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, Caroline, now a New Orleans cocktail waitress, sees a photograph of a woman in a magazine. Convinced that it is Ellie all grown up, Caroline embarks on a search for her missing sister. Armed with copies of the photo, an amateur detective guide, and a cooler of Dixie beer, Caroline travels through the New Mexico desert, the mountains of Colorado, and the smoky underworld of Montana, determined to salvage her broken family.",

    "description": "Since the time of pre-history, carpetmakers tie intricate knots to form carpets for the court of the Emperor. These carpets are made from the hairs of wives and daughters; they are so detailed and fragile that each carpetmaker finishes only one single carpet in his entire lifetime.<br /><br />This art descends from father to son, since the beginning of time itself.<br /><br />But one day the empire of the God Emperor vanishes, and strangers begin to arrive from the stars to follow the trace of the hair carpets. What these strangers discover is beyond all belief, more than anything they could have ever imagined...<br /><br />Brought to the attention of Tor Books by Orson Scott Card, this edition of <i>The Carpet Makers</i> contains a special introduction by Orson Scott Card.",

    "description": "<div>Alan is a middle-aged entrepreneur in contemporary Toronto, who has devoted himself to fixing up a house in a bohemian neighborhood. This naturally brings him in contact with the house full of students and layabouts next door, including a young woman who, in a moment of stress, reveals to him that she has wings--wings, moreover, which grow back after each attempt to cut them off. <br /><br />Alan understands. He himself has a secret or two. His father is a mountain; his mother is a washing machine; and among his brothers are a set of Russian nesting dolls. <br /><br />Now two of the three nesting dolls, Edward and Frederick, are on his doorstep--well on their way to starvation, because their innermost member, George, has vanished. It appears that yet another brother, Davey, who Alan and his other siblings killed years ago, may have returned...bent on revenge.<br /><br />Under such circumstances it seems only reasonable for Alan to involve himself with a visionary scheme to blanket Toronto with free wireless Internet connectivity, a conspiracy spearheaded by a brilliant technopunk who builds miracles of hardware from parts scavenged from the city's dumpsters. But Alan's past won't leave him alone--and Davey is only one of the powers gunning for him and all his friends.<br /></div>",

    "description": "<i>\n  <b>The 15th edition of </b>\n</i><b>The Chicago Manual of Style</b><i>\n  <b> has been superseded by the 17th edition.</b>\n</i><br /><br />In the 1890s, a proofreader at the University of Chicago Press prepared a single sheet of typographic fundamentals intended as a guide for the University community. That sheet grew into a pamphlet, and the pamphlet grew into a book\u2014the first edition of the <i>Manual of Style</i>, published in 1906. Now in its fifteenth edition, <i>The Chicago Manual of Style</i>\u2014the essential reference for authors, editors, proofreaders, indexers, copywriters, designers, and publishers in any field\u2014is more comprehensive and easier to use than ever before.<br /><br />Those who work with words know how dramatically publishing has changed in the past decade, with technology now informing and influencing every stage of the writing and publishing process. In creating the fifteenth edition of the <i>Manual</i>, Chicago's renowned editorial staff drew on direct experience of these changes, as well as on the recommendations of the <i>Manual</i>'s first advisory board, composed of a distinguished group of scholars, authors, and professionals from a wide range of publishing and business environments.<br /><br />Every aspect of coverage has been examined and brought up to date\u2014from publishing formats to editorial style and method, from documentation of electronic sources to book design and production, and everything in between. In addition to books, the <i>Manual</i> now also treats journals and electronic publications. All chapters are written for the electronic age, with advice on how to prepare and edit manuscripts online, handle copyright and permissions issues raised by technology, use new methods of preparing mathematical copy, and cite electronic and online sources.<br /><br />A new chapter covers American English grammar and usage, outlining the grammatical structure of English, showing how to put words and phrases together to achieve clarity, and identifying common errors. The two chapters on documentation have been reorganized and updated: the first now describes the two main systems preferred by Chicago, and the second discusses specific elements and subject matter, with examples of both systems. Coverage of design and manufacturing has been streamlined to reflect what writers and editors need to know about current procedures. And, to make it easier to search for information, each numbered paragraph throughout the <i>Manual</i> is now introduced by a descriptive heading.<br /><br />Clear, concise, and replete with commonsense advice, <i>The Chicago Manual of Style</i>, fifteenth edition, offers the wisdom of a hundred years of editorial practice while including a wealth of new topics and updated perspectives. For anyone who works with words, whether on a page or computer screen, this continues to be the one reference book you simply must have.<br /><br /><b></b>What's new in the Fifteenth Edition:<br /><br />* Updated material throughout to reflect current style, technology, and professional practice<br /><br />* Scope expanded to include journals and electronic publications<br /><br />* Comprehensive new chapter on American English grammar and usage by Bryan A. Garner (author of <i>A Dictionary of Modern American Usage</i>)<br /><br />* Updated and rewritten chapter on preparing mathematical copy<br /><br />* Reorganized and updated chapters on documentation, including guidance on citing electronic sources<br /><br />* Streamlined coverage of current design and production processes, with a glossary of key terms<br /><br />* Descriptive headings on all numbered paragraphs for ease of reference<br /><br />* New diagrams of the editing and production processes for both books and journals, keyed to chapter discussions<br /><br />* New, expanded Web site with special tools and features for <i>Manual</i> users at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.chicagomanualofstyle.org</a>.",

    "description": "<i>Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties</i><b> </b>is a fascinating look at the avant-garde group that came together\u2014from 1964 to 1968\u2014as Andy Warhol\u2019s Silver Factory, a cast that included Lou Reed, Nico, Edie Sedgwick, Gerard Malanga, Paul Morrissey, Joe Dallesandro, Billy Name, Candy Darling, Baby Jane Holzer, Brigid Berlin, Ultra Violet, and Viva. Steven Watson follows their diverse lives from childhood through their Factory years. He shows how this ever-changing mix of artists and poets, musicians and filmmakers, drag queens, society figures, and fashion models, all interacted at the Factory to create more than 500 films, the Velvet Underground, paintings and sculpture, and thousands of photographs. <br /><br />Between 1961 and 1964 Warhol produced his most iconic art: the Flower paintings, the Marilyns, the Campbell\u2019s Soup Can paintings, and the Brillo Boxes. But it was his films\u2014Sleep, Kiss, Empire, The Chelsea Girls, and Vinyl\u2014that constituted his most prolific output in the mid-1960s, and with this book Watson points up the important and little-known interaction of the Factory with the New York avant-garde film world. Watson sets his story in the context of the revolutionary milieu of 1960s New York: the opening of Paul Young\u2019s Paraphernalia, Truman Capote\u2019s Black and White Ball, Max\u2019s Kansas City, and the Beautiful People Party at the Factory, among many other events. <br /><br />Interspersed throughout are Watson\u2019s trademark sociogram, more than 130 black-and-white photographs\u2014some never before seen\u2014and many sidebars of quotes and slang that help define the Warholian world. With <i>Factory Made,</i> Watson has focused on a moment that transformed the art and style of a generation.",

    "description": "Cicero (Marcus Tullius, 106-43 BCE), Roman lawyer, orator, politician and philosopher, of whom we know more than of any other Roman, lived through the stirring era which saw the rise, dictatorship, and death of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic. In his political speeches especially and in his correspondence we see the excitement, tension and intrigue of politics and the part he played in the turmoil of the time. Of about 106 speeches, delivered before the Roman people or the Senate if they were political, before jurors if judicial, 58 survive (a few of them incompletely). In the fourteenth century Petrarch and other Italian humanists discovered manuscripts containing more than 900 letters of which more than 800 were written by Cicero and nearly 100 by others to him. These afford a revelation of the man all the more striking because most were not written for publication. Six rhetorical works survive and another in fragments. Philosophical works include seven extant major compositions and a number of others; and some lost. There is also poetry, some original, some as translations from the Greek.<p> The Loeb Classical Library edition of Cicero is in twenty-nine volumes.</p>",

    "description": "Internationally renowned yoga instructor Rodney Yee is the instructor of more than 26 best-selling yoga videos. In Moving toward Balance, he outlines an eight-week program of yoga postures, meditation, and breath awareness designed to lead us toward the emotional and physical balance we all crave in life. Each week introduces a new category of poses--forward bends, twists, backbends, inversions shown with variations to accommodate different levels of strength and flexibility. Along with the instruction, the text explains the significance of each pose and how it contributes on physiological and psychological levels to a complete sense of balance.<br /><br />At the core of <i>Moving toward Balance</i> is its emphasis on a home practice, enabling you to focus on what works best for your own body. Suitable for yoga students of any level, each lesson is illustrated with full-color photography and is laid out in sequential order, so there is no need to flip back and forth to follow along. There are also chapters on customizing your basic practice to address specific concerns such as lower back pain or PMS, as well as ideas to help keep your newfound practice thriving. Filled with years of Rodney's teaching expertise and more than 300 photographs, <i>Moving toward Balance</i> is the link that you've been searching for between the classroom and the home.",

    "description": "By the time Nate Fisher was laid to rest in a woodland grave sans coffin in the final season of \"Six Feet Under, \" Americans all across the country were starting to look outside the box when death came calling.\"Grave Matters\" follows families who found in \"green\" burial a more natural, more economic, and ultimately more meaningful alternative to the tired and toxic send-off on offer at the local funeral parlor.<br /><br />Eschewing chemical embalming and fancy caskets, elaborate and costly funerals, they have embraced a range of natural options, new and old, that are redefining a better American way of death. Environmental journalist Mark Harris examines this new green burial underground, leading you into natural cemeteries and domestic graveyards, taking you aboard boats from which ashes and memorial \"reef balls\" are cast into the sea. He follows a family that conducts a home funeral, one that delivers a loved one to the crematory, and another that hires a carpenter to build a pine coffin.<br /><br />In the morbidly fascinating tradition of \"Stiff, Grave Matters\" details the embalming process and the environmental aftermath of the standard funeral. Harris also traces the history of burial in America, from frontier cemeteries to the billion-dollar business it is today, reporting on real families who opted for more simple, natural returns.<br /><br />For readers who want to follow the examples of these families and, literally, give back from the grave, appendices detail everything you need to know, from exact costs and laws to natural burial providers and their contact information.",

    "description": "First published in 1855, Bulfinch's<i> Mythology </i>has introduced generations of readers to the great myths of Greece and Rome, as well as time-honored legends of Norse mythology, medieval, and chivalric tales, Oriental fables, and more. Readers have long admired Bulfinch's versions for the skill with which he wove various versions of a tale into a coherent whole, the vigor of his storytelling, and his abundant cross-references to poetry and painting, demonstrating the relationship of literature and art. <i>\n  <br /></i>Now<i> The Age of Fable,</i> the first section of the <i>Mythology,</i> is available in this inexpensive, highly readable edition. Drawing on the works of Homer, Ovid, Virgil, and other classical authors, as well as an immense trove of stories about the Norse gods and heroes, <i>The Age of Fable</i> offers lively retellings of the myths of the Greek and Roman gods: Venus and Adonis, Jupiter and Juno, Daphne and Apollo, and many others. <br />The myths and legends so vividly retold in this volume underlie much of the art, literature, and culture of Western civilization. As Bulfinch put it, \"Without a knowledge of mythology, much of the elegant literature of our own language cannot be understood and appreciated.\" With this inexpensive edition of <i>The Age of Fable, </i>readers can immerse themselves in these seminal myths, increasing their appreciation and understanding of Western culture, while enjoying the myths purely as the great stories they are. <br />",

With roots in American slave tales, <i>Tops &amp; Bottoms</i> celebrates the trickster tradition of using one\u2019s wits to overcome hardship. \u201cAs usual, Stevens\u2019 animal characters, bold and colorful, are delightful. . . .

Here unfolds a journey of discovery\u2013in a story that surprises us on every page. . . .<br /></i>\n</b><br /><b>THE MEQ<br /></b><br />On May 4, 1881, the day that Zianno Zezen\u2013Z, for short\u2013turns twelve, his life changes forever. Amid the confusion of a tragic train wreck, he has the first inkling that he is no ordinary boy . . . that he is not human at all, but instead a member of a race known as the Meq. The Meq have lost all memory of their origins; they do not know why they heal with astonishing speed, or why, once they turn twelve, they stop aging unless they meet the single other member of their race destined to join with them. <br /><br />Certain Meq possess even more amazing powers, thanks to mysterious Stones they have carried since before the dawn of recorded history. Z\u2019s father carried such a Stone, the Stone of Dreams. Now that Stone is Z\u2019s to bear . . . and to protect.<br /><br />The Meq are far-flung and elusive, but Z finds allies. He will need them; for a challenge comes from the renegade Meq called the Fleur-du-Mal\u2013the Flower of Evil. A sadistic assassin in the body of a twelve-year-old boy, the Fleur-du-Mal will become Z\u2019s archenemy in a story that spans decades and continents and features an unforgettable cast of characters, human and Meq alike.",

The ideal of the day, however, was inner beauty: a focus on good deeds and a pure heart. Today American women have more social choices and personal freedom than ever before. But fifty-three percent of our girls are dissatisfied with their bodies by the age of thirteen, and many begin a pattern of weight obsession and dieting as early as eight or nine. Why?<br /><br />In <b>The Body Project</b>, historian Joan Jacobs Brumberg answers this question, drawing on diary excerpts and media images from 1830 to the present. Tracing girls' attitudes toward topics ranging from breast size and menstruation to hair, clothing, and cosmetics, she exposes the shift from the Victorian concern with inner beauty to our modern focus on outward appearance--in particular, the desire to be model-thin and sexy. Compassionate, insightful, and gracefully written, <b>The Body Project</b> explores the gains and losses adolescent girls have inherited since they shed the corset and the ideal of virginity for a new world of sexual freedom and consumerism--a world in which the body is their primary project.<br /><br />\"Joan Brumberg's book offers us an insightful and entertaining history behind the destructive mantra of the '90s--'I hate my body!'\" --Katie Couric",

    "description": "The authors of the New York Times bestseller Crucial Conversations show you how to achieve personal, team, and organizational success by healing broken promises, resolving violated expectations, and influencing good behavior.<br /><br />Discover skills to resolve touchy, controversial, and complex issues at work and at home--now available in this follow-up to the internationally popular Crucial Conversations.<br /><br />Behind the problems that routinely plague organizations and families, you'll find individuals who are either unwilling or unable to deal with failed promises. Others have broken rules, missed deadlines, failed to live up to commitments, or just plain behaved badly--and nobody steps up to the issue. Or they do, but do a lousy job and create a whole new set of problems. Accountability suffers and new problems spring up. New research demonstrates that these disappointments aren't just irritating, they're costly--sapping organizational performance by twenty to fifty percent and accounting for up to ninety percent of divorces.<br /><br />Crucial Confrontations teaches skills drawn from 10,000 hours of real-life observations to increase confidence in facing issues like:<br /><br />- An employee speaks to you in an insulting tone that crosses the line between sarcasm and insubordination. Now what?<br />- Your boss just committed you to a deadline you know you can't meet--and not-so-subtly hinted he doesn't want to hear complaints about it.<br />- Your son walks through the door sporting colorful new body art that raises your blood pressure by forty points. Speak now, pay later.<br />- An accountant wonders how to step up to a client who is violating the law. Can you spell unemployment?<br />- Family members fret over how to tell granddad that he should no longer drive his car. This is going to get ugly.<br />- A nurse worries about what to say to an abusive physician. She quickly remembers \"how things work around here\" and decides not to say anything.<br /><br />Everyone knows how to run for cover, or if adequately provoked, step up to these confrontations in a way that causes a real ruckus. That we have down pat. Crucial Confrontations teaches you how to deal with violated expectations in a way that solves the problem at hand, and doesn't harm the relationship--and in fact, even strengthens it.<br /><br />Crucial Confrontations borrows from twenty years of research involving two groups. More than 25,000 people helped the authors identify those who were most influential during crucial confrontations. They spent 10,000 hours watching these people, documented what they saw, and then trained and tested with more than 300,000 people. Second, they measured the impact of crucial confrontations improvements on organizational and team performance--the results were immediate and sustainable: twenty to fifty percent improvements in measurable performance.",

    "description": "The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Spandau Phoenix</i> and <i>Mortal Fear</i> returns with a rich and atmospheric novel of high suspense<br /><br />When recently widowed Penn Cage leaves Houston with his young daughter and returns to his hometown seeking peace, he finds something very different. Natchez, Mississippi, is the jewel of the antebellum South, a city of old secrets and older money. Upon learning that his father is being blackmailed, Penn finds himself reopening the most highly charged murder case in the town's history, searching for the evidence that could bring down the judge who nearly destroyed his father years ago. As the town closes ranks against him, Penn is joined by Caitlin Masters, a young newspaper publisher, on a deadly quest to find answers to one of the darkest chapters of American history, a quest that pits them against the FBI, a band of brothers still fiercely guarding the tainted legacy of J. Edgar Hoover. But Penn's most dangerous journey must be made alone--into the abiding mystery of his own past, into the mind and heart of a woman he lost twenty years ago, and who still has the power to save or destroy him.",

          "description": "Penn Cage is a former prosecutor and Mayor of Natchez, Mississippi. The Penn Cage series \u201cinvolves all the quintessentially Southern themes\u2014family, racial violence, \u2018miscegenation,\u2019 honor, hypocrisy, and the quest for justice in an unfair society\u2026\u201d--\n    \n    A chronological order is not necessary, but certain books are linked by common characters or themes, and they do have a sequence in time.\n    \n    Of my \u201cNatchez\u201d or \u201cMississippi\u201d novels, the \u201cPenn Cage\u201d novels are a subcategory. I\u2019ve tried not to write a series character, for reasons I\u2019ll discuss elsewhere, but Penn has cropped up as a minor character in other Natchez books, and seems to be developing a life of his own. Of the rest, Mortal Fear, Dead Sleep, 24 Hours, and Sleep No More \u2014 while all set in Mississippi (or New Orleans)--- stand completely alone and can be read at any point.\n    \n    If you have just read Turning Angel, you should next read The Quiet Game, the novel in which Penn Cage first appeared, and which many readers believe is my best book. Blood Memory was written before Turning Angel, and Penn\u2019s father Tom Cage appears there in a supporting role, but I would read \u201cBlood Memory\u201d after \u201cThe Quiet Game,\u201d not before. You will appreciate Tom much more then.",

Moraes \"Moor\" Zogoiby, the last surviving scion of a dynasty of Cochinese spice merchants and crime lords, is also a compulsive storyteller and an exile. As he travels a route that takes him from India to Spain, he leaves behind a tale of mad passions and volcanic family hatreds, of titanic matriarchs and their mesmerized offspring, of premature deaths and curses that strike beyond the grave. <br /><br /><br /><br />\"Fierce, phantasmagorical...a huge, sprawling, exuberant novel.\"--New York Times",

    "description": "Before Valley of the Dolls and Sex and the City--the iconic novel of ambitious career girls in New York City<br /><br />When it was first published in 1958, Rona Jaffe's debut novel electrified readers who saw themselves reflected in its story of five young employees of a New York publishing company. There's Ivy League Caroline, who dreams of graduating from the typing pool to an editor's office, naive country girl April, who within months of hitting town reinvents herself as the woman every man wants on his arm; Gregg, the free-spirited actress with a secret yearning for domesticity. Now a classic, and as page-turning as when it first came out, The Best of Everything portrays their lives and passions with intelligence, affection and prose as sharp as a paper cut.<br />(back cover)",

More often than not, we're left fumbling for words, stumbling toward the door...frustrated, enraged or just plain depressed. <br />Dr. Robert M. Bramson, a psychologist and management consultant, will show you that it is possible to remain sane, dignified and optimistic when dealing with even the most Difficult People. With these lively, insightful dramatizations, you'll learn how to: <br />Identify difficult types, from the too-good-to-be-true to the too-hot-to-handle, from the perennial gossip to the eternal clam. <br />Master the step-by-step procedures that will neutralize any negative or hostile encounter. <br />Understand your own style of thinking and how it affects your ability to deal effectively with each type. <br />Maybe you can't turn \"Gloomy Gus\" into \"Pollyanna.\"..but with the help of Dr. Bramson, you'll prevent the difficult from becoming impossible---and end \"relation frustrations\" for good!",

    "description": "In MARIE ANTOINETTE, Evelyn Lever draws on a variety of resources, including diaries, letters, and firsthand accounts, to write this sumptuous, addictive delight. From family life in Vienna to the choke of the guillotine, this gripping work combines a fast-paced historical narrative with all the elements of scandalous fiction: Marie's wedding at Versailles to Louis XVI, the French court, boredom, hypocrisy, loneliness, allies, enemies, scandal, intrigue, sex, peasant riots, the fall of the Bastille, mob rule in Paris, imprisonment, and, finally, execution.<br /><br />From primary source documents Lever fashions an insightful glimpse into the French court at Versailles. The characters of court are expertly drawn. There is the dashing Axel Fersen, Marie's great love; Maria Theresa, the scheming mother trying to place her daughter on the Hapsburg throne; the legendary Madame du Barry, lover to Louis XV; and, of course, Marie herself.<br /><br />Luxuriously evocative of the Versailles court, historically sharp and witty, and detailing the compelling story of Marie Antoinette's life, Evelyn Lever's biography entrances readers.",

Here is the voice of both witness and functionary. <br /><br />Lynch stands between <i>the living and the living who have died</i> with outrage and amazement, awe and calm, straining for the brief glimpse we all get of what mortality means to a vital species.",

    "description": "THE BERTRAMS (1859) by Anthony Trollope is an unusual novel of world travel, in addition to the typical subjects of matrimony and money, social strata, couples and relationships, by the author whose best-known work (such as the Barsetshire novels) is normally set in England. This one has the flavor of a Middle Eastern travelogue with lively Victorian commentary and satire, and as such it is a fascinating glimpse into the international mindset of the time.",

In spite of that love, they have grown physically apart, each unsure of the other's thoughts and desires-until the day Ikuko discovers the key to her husband's diary with its desperate hints of jealousy and voyeurism. The key, she realises, to his very soul-",

    "description": "Between your full-length mirror and high-school biology class, you probably think you know a lot about the human body. While it's true that we live in an age when we're as obsessed with our bodies as we are with celebrity hairstyles, the reality is that most of us know very little about what chugs, churns, and thumps throughout this miraculous, scientific, and artistic system of anatomy. Yes, you've owned your skin-covered shell for decades, but you probably know more about your cell-phone plan than you do about your own body. When it comes to your longevity and quality of life, understanding your internal systems gives you the power, authority, and ability to live a healthier, younger, and better life. \"You: The Owner's Manual\" challenges your preconceived notions about how the human body works and ages, then takes you on a tour through all of the highways, back roads, and landmarks inside of you. After taking a quiz that tests your body of knowledge, you'll learn about all of your blood-pumping, food-digesting, and keys-remembering systems and organs.<br /><br />Just as important, you'll get the facts and advice you need to keep your body running long and strong. You'll find out how diseases start and how they affect your body -- as well as advice on how to prevent and beat conditions that threaten your quality of life. Complete with exercise tips, nutritional guidelines, simple lifestyle changes, and alternative approaches, \"You: The Owner's Manual\" gives you an easy, comprehensive, and life-changing how-to plan for fending off the gremlins of aging. To top it off, you'll also get the great-tasting and calorie-saving Owner's Manual Diet -- a thirty-recipe eating plan that's designedwith only one goal in mind: to help you live a younger life.<br /><br />Welcome to your body. Why don't you come on in and take a look around?",

    "description": "A client from a decades-old case reaches out to Boston PI Spenser-but can he rescue troubled April Kyle once more? <br /><br /> Longtime Spenser fans will remember that once upon a time, though not so long ago, there was a girl named April Kyle-a beautiful teenage runaway who turned to prostitution to escape her terrible family life. The book was 1982's <i>Ceremony</i>, and, thanks to Spenser, April escaped Boston's \"Combat Zone\" for the relative safety of a high-class New York City bordello. April resurfaced in <i>Taming a Sea-Horse</i>, again in dire need of Spenser's rescue-this time from the clutches of a controlling lover. But April Kyle's return in <i>Hundred-Dollar Baby</i> is nothing short of shocking. <br /><br /> When a mature, beautiful, and composed April strides into Spenser's office, the Boston PI barely hesitates before recognizing his once and future client. Now a well-established madam herself, April oversees an upscale call-girl operation in Boston's Back Bay. Still looking for Spenser's approval, it takes her a moment before she can ask him, again, for his assistance. Her business is a success; what's more, it's an all-female enterprise. Now that some men are trying to take it away from her, she needs Spenser. <br /><br /> April claims to be in the dark about who it is that's trying to shake her down, but with a bit of legwork and a bit more muscle, Spenser and Hawk find ties to organized crime and local kingpin Tony Marcus, as well as a scheme to franchise the operation across the country. As Spenser again plays the gallant knight, it becomes clear that April's not as innocent as she seems. In fact, she may be her own worst enemy.",

    "description": "More than one million hardcovers sold<br />Now available for the first time in paperback!<br /><br />The Classic Text Annotated to Update Graham's Timeless Wisdom for Today's Market Conditions<br /><br />The greatest investment advisor of the twentieth century, Benjamin Graham taught and inspired people worldwide. Graham's philosophy of \"value investing\" -- which shields investors from substantial error and teaches them to develop long-term strategies -- has made <em>The Intelligent Investor</em> the stock market bible ever since its original publication in 1949.<br /><br />Over the years, market developments have proven the wisdom of Graham's strategies. While preserving the integrity of Graham's original text, this revised edition includes updated commentary by noted financial journalist Jason Zweig, whose perspective incorporates the realities of today's market, draws parallels between Graham's examples and today's financial headlines, and gives readers a more thorough understanding of how to apply Graham's principles.<br /><br />Vital and indispensable, this HarperBusiness Essentials edition of <em>The Intelligent Investor</em> is the most important book you will ever read on how to reach your financial goals.",

    "description": "In Alice McDermott's first work of fiction since her best-selling, National Book Award-winning<i> Charming Billy</i>, a woman recalls her fifteenth summer with the wry and bittersweet wisdom of hindsight.<br /><br />The beautiful child of older parents, raised on the eastern end of Long Island, Theresa is her town's most sought-after babysitter--cheerful, poised, an effortless storyteller, a wonder with children and animals. Among her charges this fateful summer is Daisy, her younger cousin, who has come to spend a few quiet weeks in this bucolic place. While Theresa copes with the challenge presented by the neighborhood's waiflike children, the tumultuous households of her employers, the attentions of an aging painter, and Daisy's fragility of body and spirit, her precocious, tongue-in-check sense of order is tested as she makes the perilous crossing into adulthood. In her deeply etched rendering of all that happened that seemingly idyllic season, McDermott once again peers into the depths of everyday life with inimitable insight and grace.",

    "description": "Jamaica Kincaid's inspired, lyrical short stories<br /><br />Reading Jamaica Kincaid is to plunge, gently, into another way of seeing both the physical world and its elusive inhabitants. Her voice is, by turns, naively whimsical and biblical in its assurance, and it speaks of what is partially remembered partly divined. The memories often concern a childhood in the Caribbean--family, manners, and landscape--as distilled and transformed by Kincaid's special style and vision.<br /><br />Kincaid leads her readers to consider, as if for the first time, the powerful ties between mother and child; the beauty and destructiveness of nature; the gulf between the masculine and the feminine; the significance of familiar things--a house, a cup, a pen. Transfiguring our human form and our surroundings--shedding skin, darkening an afternoon, painting a perfect place--these stories tell us something we didn't know, in a way we hadn't expected.",

    "description": "High above the planet Florinia, the Squires of Sark live in unimaginable wealth and comfort. Down in the eternal spring of the planet, however, the native Florinians labor ceaselessly to produce the precious kyrt that brings prosperity to their Sarkite masters. Rebellion is unthinkable and impossible. Not only do the Florinians no longer have a concept of freedom, any disruption of the vital kyrt trade would cause other planets to rise in protest, ultimately destabilizing trade and resulting in a galactic war. So the Trantorian Empire, whose grand plan is to unite all humanity in peace, prosperity, and freedom, has stood aside and allowed the oppression to continue. Living among the workers of Florinia, Rik is a man without a memory or a past. He has been abducted and brainwashed. Barely able to speak or care for himself when he was found, Rik is widely regarded as a simpleton by the worker community where he lives. But as his memories begin to return, Rik finds himself driven by a cryptic message he is determined to deliver: Everyone on Florinia is doomed . . . the Currents of Space are bringing destruction. But if the planet is evacuated, the power of Sark will end--so some would finish the job and would kill the messenger. The fate of the Galaxy hangs in the balance.",

The scientists of the First Foundation had proved victorious; and now they retum to Hari Seldon's long-established plan to build a new Empire that the Second Foundation is not destroyed after all-and that its still-defiant survivors are preparing their revenge. Now the two exiled citizens of the Foundation-a renegade Councilman and the doddering historian-set out in search of the mythical planet Earth. . .and proof that the Second Foundation still exists. Meanwhile someone-or something-outside of both Foundations sees to be orchestrating events to suit its own ominous purpose.

For the murder of Jander Panrell is closely tied to a power struggle that will decide who will be the next interstellar pioneers in the universe.<br /><br />Armed only with his own instincts, his sometimes quirky logic, and the immutable Three Laws of Robotics, Baley sets out to solve the case. But can anything prepare a simple Earthman for the psychological complexities of a world where a beautiful woman can easily have fallen in love with an all-too human robot?",

Former Navy flyer Stephen Coonts gives an excellent sense of the complexities of modern air raids and how nerve-wracking it is, even for the best airmen, to technically solve sudden problems over and over, knowing that even a twist of fate like a peasant wildly firing a rifle from a field could wipe out the crew. Grafton alternates between remorse over the fate of his unseen Vietnamese victims on the ground and a gung-ho \"let's win this war\" sentiment that lashes at both policymakers who select less-than-important targets for the dangerous missions and advocates for peace back in the States.",

Odessa is not known to be a town big on dreams, but the Panthers help keep the hopes and dreams of this small, dusty town going. Socially and racially divided, its fragile economy follows the treacherous boom-bust path of the oil business. In bad times, the unemployment rate barrels out of control; in good times, its murder rate skyrockets. But every Friday night from September to December, when the Permian High School Panthers play football, this West Texas town becomes a place where dreams can come true. With frankness and compassion, Bissinger chronicles one of the Panthers' dramatic seasons and shows how single-minded devotion to the team shapes the community and inspires-and sometimes shatters-the teenagers who wear the Panthers' uniforms. Includes Reader's Group Guide inside. <i>Now a an NBC TV weekly drama series</i>.</div>",

    "description": "\"I am confiding this manuscript to space, not with the intention of saving myself, but to help, perhaps, to avert the appalling scourge that is menacing the human race. Lord have pity on us!\"<br /><br /> With these words, Pierre Boulle hurtles the reader onto the Planet of the Apes. In this simian world, civilization is turned upside down: apes are men and men are apes; apes rule and men run wild; apes think, speak, produce, wear clothes, and men are speechless, naked, exhibited at fairs, used for biological research. On the planet of the apes, man, having reached to apotheosis of his genius, has become inert.<br /><br /> To this planet come a journalist and a scientist. The scientist is put into a zoo, the journalist into a laboratory. Only the journalist retains the spiritual strength and creative intelligence to try to save himself, to fight the appalling scourge, to remain a man.<br /><br /> Out of this situation, Pierre Boulle has woven a tale as harrowing, bizarre, and meaningful as any in the brilliant roster of this master storyteller. With his cutomary wit, irony, and disciplined intellect and style, the author of The Bridge Over the River Kwai tells a swiftly moving story dealing with man's conflicts, and takes the reader into a suspenseful and strangely fascinating orbit.",

It gives a history of the related processes of colonization and \"housewifization\" and extends this analysis to the contemporary new international division of labor and the role that women have to play as the cheapest producers and consumers. First published in 1986, it was hailed as a major paradigm shift for feminist theory. Eleven years on, Maria Mies' theory of capitalist patriarchy has become even more relevant; this new edition includes a substantial new introduction in which she both applies her theory to the new globalized world and answers her critics.<br />",

    "description": "Among the most influential political and social forces of the 20th century, modern communism rests firmly on philosophical, political and economic underpinnings developed by Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, later known as Lenin. In this volume, comprising the four works generally considered his most important publications, Lenin presents the goals and tactics of communism with remarkable directness and forcefulness.<br /><br /><p>His first major work was <i>The Development of Capitalism in Russia</i>, written in prison after Lenin had been arrested for anti-government activities in 1895. Represented here by key sections, the book developed a number of crucial concepts, including the significance of the industrial proletariat as a revolutionary base. <i>What Is to Be Done?</i>, long regarded as the key manual of communist action, is presented complete, containing Lenin's famous dissection of the Western idea of the political party along with his own concept of a monolithic party organization devoted to achieving the goal of dictatorship of the proletariat. Also presented complete is <i>Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism,</i> in which Lenin examines the final \"parasitic\" stage of capitalism. Finally, this volume includes the complete text of <i>The State and Revolution</i>, Lenin's most significant work, in which he totally rejects the institution of Western democracy and presents his vision of the final perfection of communism.</p>",

    "description": "First published in 1895, America's greatest novel of the Civil War was written before 21-year-old Stephen Crane had \"smelled even the powder of a sham battle.\" But this powerful psychological study of a young soldier's struggle with the horrors, both within and without, that war strikes the reader with its undeniable realism and with its masterful descriptions of the moment-by-moment riot of emotions felt by me under fire. Ernest Hemingway called the novel an American classic, and Crane's genius is as much apparent in his sharp, colorful prose as in his ironic portrayal of an episode of war so intense, so immediate, so real that the terror of battle becomes our own ... in a masterpiece so unique that many believe modern American fiction began with Stephen Crane.",

    "description": "Some biologists speculate that if we ever make contact with extraterrestrials, those life forms are likely to be--like most life on earth--one-celled or smaller creatures, more comparable to bacteria than little green men. And even though such organisms would not likely be able to harm humans, the possibility exists that first contact might be our last.<p> That's the scientific supposition that Michael Crichton formulates and follows out to its conclusion in his excellent debut novel, <i>The Andromeda Strain</i>. </p><p>A Nobel-Prize-winning bacteriologist, Jeremy Stone, urges the president to approve an extraterrestrial decontamination facility to sterilize returning astronauts, satellites, and spacecraft that might carry an \"unknown biologic agent.\" The government agrees, almost too quickly, to build the top-secret Wildfire Lab in the desert of Nevada. Shortly thereafter, unbeknownst to Stone, the U.S. Army initiates the \"Scoop\" satellite program, an attempt to actively collect space pathogens for use in biological warfare. When Scoop VII crashes a couple years later in the isolated Arizona town of Piedmont, the Army ends up getting more than it asked for.</p><p> <i>The Andromeda Strain</i> follows Stone and rest of the scientific team mobilized to react to the Scoop crash as they scramble to understand and contain a strange and deadly outbreak.</p>",

This sweeping chronicle of music, politics, drugs, fear, loathing, and faith has been recognized as an indie rock classic in its own right. <br />Among the bands profiled: Mission of Burma, Butthole Surfers, The Minutemen, Sonic Youth, Black Flag, Big Black, H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, Fugazi, Minor Threat, Mudhoney, The Replacements, Beat Happening, and Dinosaur Jr.",

    "description": "Mr. Artur Sammler, Holocaust survivor, intellectual and occasional lecturer at Columbia University in 1960s New York, is a 'registrar of madness', a refined and civilized being caught among people crazy with the promises of the future (moon landings, endless possibilities). His Cyclopean gaze reflects on the degradations of city life while looking deep into the sufferings of the human soul. 'Sorry for all and sore at heart', he observes how greater luxury &amp; leisure have only led to more suffering. To Sammler--who by the end of this ferociously unsentimental novel has found the compassionate consciousness necessary to bridge the gap between himself and his fellow beings--a good life is one in which a person does what is 'required of him'. To know and to meet the 'terms of the contract\" was as true a life as one could live. At its heart, this novel is quintessential Bellow: moral, urbane, sublimely humane.",

    "description": "\"After pumping eight blasts from a sawed-off shotgun at a group of rival gang members, twelve-year-old Kody Scott was initiated into the L.A. gang the Crips. He quickly matured into one of the most formidable Crip combat soldiers, earning the name \u201cMonster\u201d for committing acts of brutality and violence that repulsed even his fellow gang members. When the inevitable jail term confined him to a maximum-security cell, a complete political and personal transformation followed: from Monster to Sanyika Shakur, black nationalist, member of the New Afrikan Independence Movement, and crusader against the causes of gangsterism. In a document that has been compared to The Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver\u2019s Soul on Ice, Shakur makes palpable the despair and decay of America\u2019s inner cities and gives eloquent voice to one aspect of the black ghetto experience today.\"",

    "description": "In a masterly work, Garry Wills shows how Lincoln reached back to the Declaration of Independence to write the greatest speech in the nation\u2019s history.<br /><br />The power of words has rarely been given a more compelling demonstration than in the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln was asked to memorialize the gruesome battle. Instead he gave the whole nation \u201ca new birth of freedom\u201d in the space of a mere 272 words. His entire life and previous training and his deep political experience went into this, his revolutionary masterpiece.<br /><br />By examining both the address and Lincoln in their historical moment and cultural frame, Wills breathes new life into words we thought we knew, and reveals much about a president so mythologized but often misunderstood. Wills shows how Lincoln came to change the world and to effect an intellectual revolution, how his words had to and did complete the work of the guns, and how Lincoln wove a spell that has not yet been broken.",

    "description": "Dostoyevsky's passionate concern for people and his intense desire to grasp the meaning of life led him to explore the secret depths of man's struggles and sins. No action or thought was ever too corrupt or too inhuman for his understanding. <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> was his last and greatest work. This extraordinary novel tells the dramatic story of four brothers--Dmitri, pleasure-seeking, impatient, unruly...Ivan, brilliant and morose...Alyosha, gentle, loving, honest...and the illegitimate Smerdyakov, sly, silent, cruel. Driven by intense passion, they become involved in the brutal murder of their own father, one of the most loathsome characters in all literature.<br />\"Dostoyevsky paints like Rembrandt, and his portraits are artistically so powerful and often so perfect that even if they lacked the depths of thought that lie behind them, and around them, I believe that Dostoyevsky would still be the greatest of all novelists.\"--Andr\u00e9 Gide<br /><br />With a Foreword by MANUEL KOMROFF",

Worse, he's right in the middle of a apocalyptic battle between two sorcerous armies, and everyone expects him to play a role they won't explain. All Vlad's got between him and the worst kind of death is his wits. Oh, and a smart-mouthed winged lizard...<br /><br /><i>Dragon</i> is Steven Brust at his best--a swashbuckling fantasy adventure.",

I made every effort to write them so that they could be read in any order. I am aware that, in some measure at least, I have failed (I certainly wouldn't recommend starting with <i>Teckla</i>, for example), but the fact that I was trying makes me incapable of giving an answer.\n    \n    Many people whose opinion I respect believe publication order is best . . . The choice, I daresay, is yours. In any case, I hope you enjoy them.\n    \n    --Steven Brust, 1999, in the notes for <i>The Book of Jhereg</i></blockquote>The books are numbered in publication order;  here is a rough guide to chronological order:\n    \n        Taltos (1988)\n        Dragon (1998)\n        Yendi (1984)\n        Tiassa, section 1 (2011)\n        Jhereg (1983)\n        Teckla (1987)\n        Phoenix (1990)\n        Jhegaala (2008)\n        Athyra (1993)\n        Orca (1996)\n        Issola (2001)\n        Dzur (2006)\n        Tiassa, section 2 (2011)\n        Iorich (2010)\n        Tiassa, section 3 (2011)\n    \n    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Brust\n    \n    http://us.macmillan.com/series/Vlad",

I made every effort to write them so that they could be read in any order. I am aware that, in some measure at least, I have failed (I certainly wouldn't recommend starting with <i>Teckla</i>, for example), but the fact that I was trying makes me incapable of giving an answer.\n    \n    Many people whose opinion I respect believe publication order is best . . . The choice, I daresay, is yours. In any case, I hope you enjoy them.\n    \n    --Steven Brust, 1999, in the notes for <i>The Book of Jhereg</i></blockquote>The books are numbered in publication order;  here is a rough guide to chronological order:\n    \n        Taltos (1988)\n        Dragon (1998)\n        Yendi (1984)\n        Tiassa, section 1 (2011)\n        Jhereg (1983)\n        Teckla (1987)\n        Phoenix (1990)\n        Jhegaala (2008)\n        Athyra (1993)\n        Orca (1996)\n        Issola (2001)\n        Dzur (2006)\n        Tiassa, section 2 (2011)\n        Iorich (2010)\n        Tiassa, section 3 (2011)\n    \n    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Brust\n    \n    http://us.macmillan.com/series/Vlad",

Scarred by the senseless death of their son and baffled by the engulfing chaos of the 1960s, Allston and his wife, Ruth, have left the coast for a California retreat. And although their new home looks like Eden, it also has serpents: Jim Peck, a messianic exponent of drugs, yoga, and sex; and Marian Catlin, an attractive young woman whose otherworldly innocence is far more appealing\u2014and far more dangerous.",

Full of gripping characters, mood-altering detail, and a killer virtual soundtrack, Miss Misery is a genre-defying exploration of growing up and going out in the new century. As he rockets the reader from cyberspace to nightclub bathrooms, from the heart of New York City to the suburbs of Utah, Andy Greenwald unspools a fast-moving, funny story about the timeless need to become the main character in your own life.",

    "description": "In this blockbuster word-of-mouth, underground classic, <i>Bomb the Suburbs: Graffiti, Race, Freight-Hopping and the Search for Hip Hop's Moral Center</i>, William Upski Wimsatt attacks the whole idea of the suburb as \"an unfortunate state- of-mind..., founded on fear, conformity, shallowness of character, and dullness of imagination.\" Upski uses his coming of age in the Chicago break dancing and hip hop scene as a springboard into a totally original discussion of american identity. <i>Bomb the Suburbs: Graffiti, Race, Freight-Hopping and the Search for Hip Hop's Moral Center</i> is a brilliant dissection and advocacy for a real alternative, using art, parody, reportage and downright good writing.",

Shapes: Is that a carrot, or a triangle? Colors: Watch for peppers in every range of the rainbow. Numbers: A zero-to-ten zoo! ABCs: A full produce section of sculptures acts out the alphabet. And Opposites: You've never seen Up/Down and Big/Little like this before! Every time we think Saxton Freymann can do no more with bok choy or broccoli, he astonishes us all over again. And this book is one-stop shopping for all parents' early-childhood education needs. Try some FOOD FOR THOUGHT!",

    "description": "Life can be sweet. Our relationships with friends, spouses, colleagues, and family members can be wonderfully rewarding. They can also bring heartache, frustration, anxiety, and anger. We all know the difference between times when we feel open, generous and at ease with people versus times when we are guarded, defensive, and on edge.<br /><br /> Why do we get trapped in negative emotions when it's clear that life is so much fuller and richer when we are free of them?<br /><br /><i>Bonds That Make Us Free</i>\u00a0is a ground-breaking book that suggests the remedy for our troubling emotions by addressing their root causes. You'll learn how, in ways we scarcely suspect, we are responsible for feelings like anger, envy, and insecurity that we have blamed on others. (How many times have you said, \"You're making me mad?\")<br /><br /> Even though we fear to admit this, it is good news. If we produce these emotions, it falls within our power to stop them. But we have to understand our part in them far better than we do, and that is what this remarkable book teaches.<br /><br /> Because the key is seeing truthfully, the book itself is therapeutic. As you read and identify with the many true stories of people who have seen a transformation in their lives, you will find yourself reflecting with fresh honesty upon your relationships. This will bond you to others in love and respect and lift you out of the negative thoughts and feelings that have held you captive. You will feel your heart changing even as you read.<br /><br /> \"It would not be accurate to describe this book as supplying the truths upon which we must build our lives,\" writes author C. Terry Warner. \"Instead it shows how we can put ourselves in that receptive, honest, and discerning condition that will enable us, any of us, to find these truths on our own.\"<br /><br /> Finding these truths is the key to healing our relationships and coming to ourselves, and\u00a0<i>Bonds That Make Us Free\u00a0</i>starts us on that great journey.<br />",

    "description": "\u201cListen, are you breathing just a little, and calling it a life?\u201d \u2014Mary Oliver<br /><br />This luminous anthology brings together great poets from around the world whose work transcends culture and time. Their words reach past the outer divisions to the universal currents of love and revelation that move and inspire us all. These poems urge us to wake up and love. They also call on us to relinquish our grip on ideas and opinions that confine us and, instead, to risk moving forward into the life that is truly ours.<br /><br />In his selection, Roger Housden has placed strong emphasis on contemporary voices such as the American poet laureate Billy Collins and the Nobel Prize\u2013winners Czeslaw Milosz and Seamus Heaney, but the collection also includes some timeless echoes of the past in the form of work by masters such as Goethe, Wordsworth, and Emily Dickinson.<br /><br />The tens of thousands of readers of Roger Housden\u2019s \u201cTen Poems\u201d series will welcome this beautiful harvest of poems that both open the mind and heal the heart.",

With characteristic vigor and iconoclasm, Pound illustrates his precepts with exhibits meticulously chosen from the classics, and the concluding \u201cTreatise on Meter\u201d provides an illuminating essay for anyone aspiring to read and write poetry. The ABC of Reading emphasizes Pound's ability to discover neglected and unknown genius, distinguish originals from imitations, and open new avenues in literature for our time.",

    "description": "The story of how a boy who believed in the goodness of human nature set out to change the world.<br /><br /><i>Pay It Forward</i> is a wondrous and moving novel about Trevor McKinney, a twelve-year-old boy in a small California town who accepts the challenge that his teacher gives his class, a chance to earn extra credit by coming up with a plan to change the world for the better -- and to put that plan into action.<br /><br />The idea that Trevor comes up with is so simple and so na\u00efve that when others learn of it they are dismissive. Even Trevor himself begins to doubt when his \"pay it forward\" plan seems to founder on a combination of bad luck and the worst of human nature.<br /><br />In the end, <i>Pay It Forward</i> is the story of seemingly ordinary people made extraordinary by the simple faith of a child. In the tradition of the successful and inspirational television show <i>Touched by an Angel</i>, and the phenomenally successful novel and film <i>Forrest Gump</i>, <i>Pay It Forward</i> is a work of charm, wit, and remarkable inspiration, a story of hope for today and for many tomorrows to come.",

    "description": "A work of stunning authority and imagination - a book that is as wondrous and joyful as it is wrenchingly sad, and that heralds the arrival of a profoundly gifted new storyteller.<br /><br />Already sold in eight countries around the world, these nine energized, irreverent stories from Nathan Englander introduce an astonishing new talent. <br /><br />In Englander's amazingly taut and ambitious \"The Twenty-seventh Man,\" a clerical error lands earnest, unpublished Pinchas Pelovits in prison with twenty-six writers slated for execution at Stalin's command, and in the grip of torture Pinchas composes a mini-masterpiece, which he recites in one glorious moment before author and audience are simultaneously annihilated. In \"The Gilgul of Park Avenue,\" a Protestant has a religious awakening in the back of a New York taxi. In the collection's hilarious title story, a Hasidic man incensed by his wife's interminable menstrual cycle gets a dispensation from his rabbi to see a prostitute. <br /><br />The stories in For the Relief of Unbearable Urges are powerfully inventive and often haunting, steeped in the weight of Jewish history and in the customs of Orthodox life. But it is in the largeness of their spirit-- a spirit that finds in doubt a doorway to faith, that sees in despair a chance for the heart to deepen--and in the wisdom that so prodigiously transcends the author's twenty-eight years, that these stories are truly remarkable. Nathan Englander envisions a group of Polish Jews herded toward a train bound for Auschwitz and in a deft imaginative twist turns them into acrobats tumbling out of harm's way; he takes an elderly wigmaker and makes her, for a single moment, beautiful. Again and again, Englander does what feels impossible: he finds, wherever he looks, a province beyond death's dominion.<br /><br />For the Relief of Unbearable Urges is a work of stunning authority and imagination--a book that is as wondrous and joyful as it is wrenchingly sad, and that heralds the arrival of a profoundly gifted new storyteller.",
