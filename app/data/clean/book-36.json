    "description": "A revealing and intimate biography about Janis Joplin, the Queen of Classic Rock, written by her younger sister.<br /><br />Janis Joplin blazed across the sixties music scene, electrifying audiences with her staggering voice and the way she seemed to pour her very soul into her music. By the time her life and artistry were cut tragically short by a heroin overdose, Joplin had become the stuff of rock\u2013and\u2013roll legend.<br /><br />Through the eyes of her family and closest friends , we see Janis as a young girl, already rebelling against injustice, racism, and hypocrisy in society. We follow Janis as she discovers her amazing talents in the Beat hangouts of Venice and North Beach\u2013singing in coffeehouses, shooting speed to enhance her creativity, challenging the norms of straight society. Janis truly came into her own in the fantastic, psychedelic, acid\u2013soaked world of Haight\u2013Asbury. At the height of her fame, Janis's life is a whirlwind of public adoration and hard living. Laura Joplin shows us not only the public Janice who could drink Jim Morrison under the table and bean him with a bottle of booze when he got fresh; she shows us the private Janis, struggling to perfect her art, searching for the balance between love and stardom, battling to overcome her alcohol addiction and heroin use in a world where substance abuse was nearly universal.<br /><br />At the heart of <em>Love</em>, Janis is an astonishing series of letters by Janis herself that have never been previously published. In them she conveys as no one else could the wild ride from awkward small\u2013town teenager to rock\u2013and\u2013roll queen. Love, Janis is the new life of Janis Joplin we have been waiting for\u2013a celebration of the sixties' joyous experimentation and creativity, and a loving, compassionate examination of one of that era's greatest talents.",

    "description": "Nikos Kazantzakis is no stranger to the heroes of Greek antiquity. In this historical novel based on the life of Alexander the Great, Kazantzakis has drawn on both the rich tradition of Greek legend and the documented manuscripts from the archives of history to recreate an Alexander in all his many-faceted images\u2014Alexander the god; Alexander the descendant of Heracles performing the twelve labors; Alexander the mystic, the daring visionary destined to carry out a divine mission; Alexander the flesh-and-blood mortal who, on occasion, is not above the common soldier\u2019s brawling and drinking.<br /><br />The novel, which resists the temptation to portray Alexander in the mantle of purely romantic legend, covers his life from age fifteen to his death at age thirty-two. It opens with Alexander\u2019s first exploit, the taming of the horse, Bucephalas, and is seen in great part through the eyes of his young neighbor who eventually becomes an officer in his army and follows him on his campaign to conquer the world.<br /><br />The book, which was written primarily as an educational adjunct for young readers, is intended for the adult mind as well, and like the legends of old, is entertaining as well as instructive for readers of all ages. It was originally published in Greece in serial form in 1940, and was republished in a complete volume in 1979.",

    "description": "At a time when a lasting peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis seems virtually unattainable, understanding the roots of their conflict is an essential step in restoring hope to the region. In <i>The Iron Cage</i>, Rashid Khalidi, one of the most respected historians and political observers of the Middle East, homes in on Palestinian politics and history. <br /><br />The story of the Palestinian search to establish a state begins in the mandate period immediately following the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, the era of British control, when fledgling Arab states were established by the colonial powers with assurances of eventual independence. Mandatory Palestine was a place of real promise, with unusually high literacy rates among men and a relatively advanced economy. But the British had already begun to construct an iron cage to hem in the Palestinians and the Palestinian leadership made a series of errors including their overwhelming support of Hitler and the genocide of the Jews, that would eventually prove crippling to their dream of independence.<br /><br />",

Although sometimes inaccurately described as traditional Mesoamerican shamanism, these most ancient protocols or disciplines are more accurately referred to nowadays, thanks in large part to Carlos Castaneda, as \"Nagual Shamanism\".",

It offers the essence of each word makes Lao Tsu's teaching immediate and alive.\u00a0<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The philosophy of Lao Tsu is simple:\u00a0Accept what is in front of you without wanting the situation to be other than it is. Study the natural order of things and work with it rather than against it, for to try to change what <i>is</i> only sets up resistance. Nature provides for all without discrimination\u2014therefore let us present the same face to everyone and treat\u00a0all men as equals, however they may be have.\u00a0 If we watch carefully, we will see that work proceeds more quickly and easily if we stop looking for results.\u00a0 In the clarity of a still and open mind, truth will be reflected.\u00a0 We will come to appreciate the original meaning of the word \"understand,\" which means \"to stand under.\" We serve whatever or whoever stands before us, without any thought for ourselves. <i>Te\u2014</i>which may be translated as \"virtue\" or \"strength\"\u2014lies always in <i>Tao</i>, or \"natural law.\"\u00a0 In other words: Simply be.</p>",

    "description": "According to my thirteen-year-old son, every superhero has an origin. My origin is a little embarrassing. I wasn't put into a rocket and sent to Earth by my parents. I wasn't bitten by a radioactive spider. No, I was merely the innocent victim of a Horrible Swiffer Accident....Strange things are happening to divorced mother of two Birdie Lee since the Horrible Swiffer Accident. She can sense danger (for example, a carload of speeding teenagers not wearing their seat belts) and spring into action with superhuman speed. She can find out what her daughter is up to on the Internet without even having to snoop. And she's got cleaning powers ordinary women can only dream of....<br /><br />Warm, witty, and full of heart, <b>Confessions of Super Mom</b> is the tale of a woman who dares to take a stand against everything from stubborn stains to smug exs to corporate CEOs--and winds up defeating evil in some very unexpected ways.<br />",

    "description": "Secrecy and Silence\u00a0are second nature to Marcello Clerici, the hero of <i>The Conformist</i>, a book which made Alberto Moravia one of the world's most read postwar writers. Clerici is a man with everything under control - a wife who loves him, colleagues who respect him, the hidden power that comes with his secret work for the Italian political police during the Mussolini years. But then he is assigned to kill his former professor, now exiled in France, to demonstrate his loyalty to the Fascist state, and falls in love with a strange, compelling woman; his life is torn open - and with it the corrupt heart of Fascism. Moravia equates the rise of Italian Fascism with the psychological needs of his protagonist for whom conformity becomes an obsession in a life that has included parental neglect, an oddly self-conscious desire to engage in cruel acts, and a type of male beauty which, to Clerici's great distress, other men find attractive.",

    "description": "For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard \"accidentally\" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. <p> As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>",

Never mind that he wants her to change\u2014a diet, ice-blond highlights, stilettos, snooty gallery openings\u2014and that he\u2019s allergic to nature and kids. She tells herself she\u2019s happy to sacrifice for love, and besides, with Joe\u2019s stunning good looks and high-profile career at a top financial firm, every woman in London wants to be in her shoes. <br /><br />But that\u2019s just the problem. Despite Alice\u2019s efforts to be the perfect wife, Joe soon reveals a penchant for being hopelessly unfaithful. When a notorious indiscretion with a female colleague forces Joe to transfer to New York, Alice\u2019s life turns upside down. As Joe continues to sneak around, and her best friend\u2019s beau offers a tempting glimpse of what real love could be like, Alice must decide how much Cinderella she can take before her deepest desires win out\u2014and if she can summon up the courage to find real happiness on her own. <br /><br /><i>Delicious, witty, and packed with sparkling sex appeal, <b>To Have and To Hold</b> is an unputdownable read that will have you rooting out loud for its endearing heroine. A #1 bestseller in Britain, this latest tale from the beloved, utterly winning <b>Jane Green</b> proves that the search for true love doesn\u2019t always end when someone dons a veil, and offers a lively, refreshing take on modern marriage.</i>",

    "description": "Subtitled <i>An Exegesis of Squalor</i>, <i>The Hard Life</i> is a sober farce from a master of Irish comic fiction. Set in Dublin at the turn of the century, the novel does involve squalor illness, alcoholism, unemployment, bodily functions, crime, illicit sex but also investigates such diverse topics as Church history, tightrope walking, and the pressing need for public toilets for ladies. The Hard Life is straight-faced entertainment that conceals in laughter its own devious and wicked satire by one of the best known Irish writers of the 20th century.\"",

    "description": "<b>For centuries they\u2019ve lived in secret among northern England\u2019s green and misted hills. Creatures of extraordinary beauty, power, and sensuality, they possess the ability to shape-shift from human to dragon and back again. Now their secret\u2014and their survival\u2014is threatened by a temptation that will break every boundary.</b><br /><br />Dubbed the Smoke Thief, a daring jewel thief is confounding the London police. His wealthy victims claim the master burglar can walk through walls and vanish into thin air. But Christoff, the charismatic Marquess of Langford, knows the truth: the thief is no ordinary human but a \"runner\" who's fled Darkfrith without permission. As Alpha leader of the <i>dr\u00e1kon</i>, it's Kit's duty to capture the fugitive before the secrets of the tribe are revealed to mortals. But not even Kit suspects that the Smoke Thief could be a woman. <br /><br />Clarissa Rue Hawthorne knew her dangerous exploits would attract the attention of the <i>dr\u00e1kon</i>. But she didn't expect Christoff himself to come to London, dangling the tribe's most valuable jewel\u2014the Langford Diamond\u2014as bait. For as long as she could remember, Rue had lived the life of a halfling\u2014half <i>dr\u00e1kon</i>, half mortal\u2014and an outcast in both worlds. She'd always loved the handsome and willful Kit from the only place it was safe: from afar. But now she was no longer the shy, timid girl she'd once been. She was the first woman capable of making the Turn in four generations. So why did she still feel the same dizzying sense of vulnerability whenever he was near?<br /><br />From the moment he saw her, Kit knew that the alluring and powerful beauty was every bit his Alpha equal and destined to be his bride. And by the harsh laws of the <i>dr\u00e1kon</i>, Rue knew that she was the property of the marquess. But they will risk banishment and worse for a chance at something greater. For now Rue is his prisoner, the diamond has disappeared, and she's made the kind of dangerous proposition a man like Kit cannot resist.",

    "description": "On October 25, 1946, in a crowded room in Cambridge, England, the great twentieth-century philosophers Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper came face to face for the first and only time. The meeting -- which lasted ten minutes -- did not go well. Their loud and aggressive confrontation became the stuff of instant legend, but precisely what happened during that brief confrontation remained for decades the subject of intense disagreement.<br /><br />An engaging mix of philosophy, history, biography, and literary detection, <em>Wittgenstein's Poker</em> explores, through the Popper/Wittgenstein confrontation, the history of philosophy in the twentieth century. It evokes the tumult of fin-de-si\u00e9cle Vienna, Wittgentein's and Popper's birthplace; the tragedy of the Nazi takeover of Austria; and postwar Cambridge University, with its eccentric set of philosophy dons, including Bertrand Russell. At the center of the story stand the two giants of philosophy themselves -- proud, irascible, larger than life -- and spoiling for a fight.",

    "description": "<p>A sinisterly funny modern-day <em>Through the Looking Glass</em> that begins with cyanide poisoning and ends in strawberry ice cream.</p><em>\"My story, the story of 'how I became a nun,' began very early in my life; I had just turned six. The beginning is marked by a vivid memory, which I can reconstruct down to the last detail. Before, there is nothing, and after, everything is an extension of the same vivid memory, continuous and unbroken, including the intervals of sleep, up to the point where I took the veil .\"</em> So starts Cesar Aira's astounding \"autobiographical\" novel. Intense and perfect, this invented narrative of childhood experience bristles with dramatic humor at each stage of growing up: a first ice cream, school, reading, games, friendship. The novel begins in Aira's hometown, Coronel Pringles. As self-awareness grows, the story rushes forward in a torrent of anecdotes which transform a world of uneventful happiness into something else: the anecdote becomes adventure, and adventure, fable, and then legend. Between memory and oblivion, reality and fiction, Cesar Aira's <em>How I Became a Nun</em> retains childhood's main treasures: the reality of fable and the delirium of invention.<br /><br />A few days after his fiftieth birthday, Aira noticed the thin rim of the moon, visible despite the rising sun. When his wife explained the phenomenon to him he was shocked that for fifty years he had known nothing about \"something so obvious, so visible.\" This epiphany led him to write <em>How I Became a Nun</em>. With a subtle and melancholic sense of humor he reflects on his failures, on the meaning of life, and the importance of literature.",

    "description": "\"No one ever suspects,\" begins <em>Tomorrow in the Battle Think On Me</em>, \"that they might one day find themselves with a dead woman in their arms....\" Marta has just met Victor when she invites him to dinner at her Madrid apartment while her husband is away on business. When her two-year-old son finally falls asleep, Marta and Victor retreat to the bedroom. Undressing, she suddenly feels ill; and in his arms, inexplicably, she dies.<br /><br /><br />What should Victor do? Remove the compromising tape from the phone machine? Leave food for the child, for breakfast? These are just his first steps, but he soon takes matters further; unable to bear the shadows and the unknowing, Victor plunges into dark waters. And Javier Mar\u00edas, Europe's master of secrets, of what lies reveal and truth may conceal, is on sure ground in this profound, quirky, and marvelous novel. \"Brilliantly imagined and hugely intricate,\" as <em>La Vanguardia</em> noted, \"it is a novel one reads with enormous pleasure.\"",

Here Robert Delaney and his young friends join the Fenian uprising and, in one night of violence, seal their fates with a secret that shapes the rest of their lives. Ned Nolan chooses terrorism and the gun; and Delaney himself becomes Ireland's champion, rising to power as a politician - and falling in love with a beautiful, forbidden woman who can destroy him as mercilessly as the haunting truth of his past. Together, they are The Tenants of Time...embodying, embracing, and echoing all the passions of this most passionate land.",

Step back in time with two of <i>Queer as Folk's</i> hottest characters in the first book in this provocative new series.</p>\n <p> </p>\n  <b>Every Nine Seconds</b>\n <p> On the eve of Brian Kinney's eighteenth birthday, he and his best friend, Michael Novotny, celebrate a bond that could link them forever if their future paths don't separate them for good. In a few short weeks Brian, the seductive soccer star, will leave for college, where he'll be free to explore the adult pursuits in which he's only dabbled in high school. Michael is destined for a more sedate life in community college while living at home with his eccentric mom. But before their lives diverge, a hot new club will open, they'll go to the prom \"stag\" together, and family strife will turn their world upside down. Brian and Michael still have some unforgettable times to share before graduation ushers in the next stages of their lives.<br /></p>",

    "description": "<b>Jane Austen</b>\u2019s first published novel, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> is a wonderfully entertaining tale of flirtation and folly that revolves around two starkly different sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. While Elinor is thoughtful, considerate, and calm, her younger sister is emotional and wildly romantic. Both are looking for a husband, but neither Elinor\u2019s reason nor Marianne\u2019s passion can lead them to perfect happiness\u2014as Marianne falls for an unscrupulous rascal and Elinor becomes attached to a man who\u2019s already engaged.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br /><br />Startling secrets, unexpected twists, and heartless betrayals interrupt the marriage games that follow. Filled with satiric wit and subtle characterizations, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> teaches that true love requires a balance of reason and emotion.<br /><br /><br /><i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, by <b>Jane Austen</b>, is part of the <i><i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i>\u00a0</i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

    "description": "In the speech he gave upon accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, Albert Camus said that a writer \"cannot serve today those who make history; he must serve those who are subject to it.\" And in these twenty-three political essays, he demonstrates his commitment to history's victims, from the fallen maquis of the French Resistance to the casualties of the Cold War.<br /><i>Resistance, Rebellion and Death</i> displays Camus's rigorous moral intelligence addressing issues that range from colonial warfare in Algeria to the social cancer of capital punishment. But this stirring book is above all a reflection on the problem of freedom, and, as such, belongs in the same tradition as the works that gave Camus his reputation as the conscience of our century: <i>The Stranger</i>, <i>The Rebel</i> and <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i>.",

    "description": "\"The stain of Jim Crow runs deep in 20th-century America. . . . Its effects remain the nation's most pressing business. Trouble in Mind is an absolutely essential account of its dreadful history and calamitous legacy.\"\u00a0\u00a0--The Washington Post<br /><br />\"The most complete and moving account we have had of what the victims of the Jim Crow South suffered and somehow endured.\"<br />--C. Vann Woodward<br /><br />In April 1899, black laborer Sam Hose killed his white boss in self-defense. Wrongly accused of raping the man's wife, Hose was mutilated, stabbed, and burned alive in front of 2,000 cheering whites. His body was sold piecemeal to souvenir seekers; an Atlanta grocery displayed his knuckles in its front window for a week.<br /><br />With the same narrative skill he brought to the Pulitzer Prize-winning Been in the Storm So Long, Leon Litwack constructs a searing history of life under Jim Crow. Drawing on new documentation and first-person accounts by blacks and whites, he describes the injustices--both institutional and personal--inflicted against a people. Here, too, are the black men and women whose activism, literature, and music preserved the genius of their human spirit. Painstakingly researched, important, and timely, Trouble in Mind recalls the bloodiest and most repressive period in the history of race relations in the United States--and the painful record of discrimination that haunts us to this day.<br /><br />\"Moving, elegant, earthy and pointed. . . . It forces us to reckon with the tragic legacies of freedom as well as of slavery. And it reminds us of the resilience and creativity of the human spirit.\" <br />--Steven Hahn, The San Diego Union-Tribune<br /><br />\"A chilling reminder of how simple it has been for Americans to delude themselves about the power of race.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 --The Raleigh News &amp; Observer",

    "description": "Looking for real life. The scrawled graffiti on the bathroom wall was innocent enough, cliched even. But for Claire Wilder, it was a wake-up call: start searching for your roots and find the happiness you lost long ago. Divorced from her high school sweetheart, Claire has wasted too much time waiting for Andrew to come back, and in the process has lost the flavor of her own life.<br /><br />Leaving behind her fast-paced life, Claire ends up in her father's hometown of Valentine, Oklahoma, for a brief stay at the Goodnight Motel. But her arrival is like a pebble tossed into a pond, its ripples affecting the town's eccentric residents who like things just the way they are, thank you. Gradually the days turn into weeks, and before Claire knows it, she's discovered something she had almost forgotten existed: a place to call home.<br /><br />Just when it looks as if things might finally be falling into place for Claire, life throws her another curve:Andrew shows up unexpectedly in Valentine -- to woo her back! Now Claire must decide: return to the home and security she once knew, or stay in Valentine with the promise of a new life and the possibility of a new love....",

She never wears jeans or shorts. She never says please or thank you. And she says she is a witch. It's not always easy being friends with a witch, but it's never boring. At first an apprentice and then a journeyman witch, Elizabeth learns to eat raw ends and how to cast small spells. And she and Jennifer collaborate on cooking up an ointment that will enable them to fly. That's when a marvelous toad, Hilary Ezra, enters their lives. And that's when trouble starts to brew.",

    "description": "<b>A comprehensive history of the people and cases that have changed history, this is the definitive account of the nation's highest court</b><br /><br />Recent changes in the Supreme Court have placed the venerable institution at the forefront of current affairs, making this comprehensive and engaging work as timely as ever. In the tradition of Howard Zinn's classic <i>A People's History of the United States</i>, Peter Irons chronicles the decisions that have influenced virtually every aspect of our society, from the debates over judicial power to controversial rulings in the past regarding slavery, racial segregation, and abortion, as well as more current cases about school prayer, the Bush/Gore election results, and \"enemy combatants.\" To understand key issues facing the supreme court and the current battle for the court's ideological makeup, there is no better guide than Peter Irons. This revised and updated edition includes a foreword by Howard Zinn.<br /><br />\"A sophisticated narrative history of the Supreme Court . . . [Irons] breathes abundant life into old documents and reminds readers that today's fiercest arguments about rights are the continuation of the endless American conversation.\" -<i>Publisher's Weekly</i> (starred review)",

    "description": "An engrossing and intimate portrait of the Oklahoma-based psychedelic pop band the Flaming Lips, cult heroes to millions of indie-rock fans.<b>\n  <br /></b><br />In July 2002, the Flaming Lips released an ambitious album called <i>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, </i> which merged elements of orchestral pop, electronic dance music, and old-fashioned psychedelic rock with lyrical themes that were simultaneously poignant and philosophical and supremely silly. The album sold a million copies worldwide, introduced the Flaming Lips to a mass audience, and made them one of the best-known cult bands in rock history.<br /><br /><i>Staring at Sound</i> is the tale of the Flaming Lips's fascinating career (which, in reality, began in 1983) and the many colorful personalities in their orbit, especially Wayne Coyne, their charismatic and visionary founder. Based on hundreds of hours of interviews with the band, it follows the Flaming Lips through the thriving indie-rock underground of the 1980s and the alternative-rock movement of the early '90s, during which they found fans in such rock legends as Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Robert Plant, and Devo, and respected peers in such acts as the White Stripes, Radiohead, and Beck. It concludes with exclusive coverage of the creation of the group's latest album, <i>At War with the Mystics</i>.",

    "description": "With the incisive pen of a newspaperman and the compassionate soul of a poet, Mike Royko was a Chicago institution who became, in Jimmy Breslin's words, \"the best journalist of his time.\" Culled from 7500 columns and spanning four decades, from his early days to his last dispatch, the writings in this collection reflect a radically changing America as seen by a man whose keen sense of justice and humor never faltered. Faithful readers will find their old favorites and develop new ones, while the uninitiated have the enviable good fortune of experiencing this true American voice for the first time.<br /><br />\"A treasure trove lies between these covers. Royko was in a class by himself. He was a true original.\"\u2014Ann Landers<br /><br />\"The joy of <i>One More Time</i> is Royko in his own words.\"\u2014Mary Eileen O'Connell, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br /><br />\"Reading a collection of Royko's columns is even more of a pleasure than encountering them one by one, and that is a large remark for he rarely wrote a piece that failed to wake you up with his hard-earned moral wit. Three cheers for Royko!\"\u2014Norman Mailer<br /><br />\"Powerful, punchy, amazingly contemporary.\"\u2014Neil A. Grauer, <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i><br /><br />\"This crackling collection of his own favorite columns as well as those beloved by his fans reminds us just how much we miss the gruff, compassionate voice of Mike Royko.\"\u2014Jane Sumner, <i>Dallas Morning News</i><br /><br />\"A marvelous road map through four decades of America.\"\u2014Elizabeth Taylor, <i>Chicago Tribune Books</i><br /><br />\"Royko was an expert at finding universal truths in parochial situations, as well as in the larger issues\u2014war and peace, justice and injustice, wealth and poverty\u2014he examined. Think of <i>One More Time</i> as one man's pungent commentary on life in these United States over the last few decades.\"\u2014<i>Booklist</i><br /><br />\"Royko was one of the most respected and admired people in the business, by readers and colleagues alike. . . . Savor [his sketches] while you can.\"\u2014Jonathan Yardley, <i>Washington Post Book World</i><br /><br />\"Book collections of columns aren't presumed to be worth reading. This one is, whether or not you care about newspapering or Chicago.\"\u2014Neil Morgan, <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i><br /><br />\"A treasure house for journalism students, for would-be writers, for students of writing styles, for people who just like to laugh at the absurdity of the human condition or, as Studs Terkel said, for those who will later seek to learn what it was really like in the 20th century.\"\u2014Georgie Anne Geyer, <i>Washington Times</i><br /><br />\"Full of astonishments, and the greatest of these is Royko's technical mastery as a writer.\"\u2014Hendrik Hertzberg, <i>New Yorker</i><br /><br />\"A great tribute to an American original, a contrarian blessed with a sense of irony and a way with words.\"\u2014Bob Minzesheimer, <i>USA Today</i><br /><br />\"In this posthumous collection of his columns, journalist Royko displays the breezy wit that made him so beloved in the Windy City.\"\u2014<i>People</i><br />",

    "description": "<b> The classic, bestselling novel of Central Park West ennui--and a seminal piece of urban women's fiction that remains influential today (<i>Bridget Jones's Diary,</i> et al)--back in print after many years</b><br /><br />Made into a major motion picture that garnered an Oscar nomination, <i>Diary of a Mad Housewife</i> is a classic of women's fiction that gave a wry voice to the nascent feminist stirrings of the 1960s and helped incite a revolution in the consciousness of a generation. After many years, this best-selling novel of Manhattan ennui is finally back in print.<br /><br />When Bettina Balser begins to suspect that she is going mad, she starts a secret diary as a form of therapy and escape. Her fears pour onto the page: Elevators, subways, bridges, tunnels, high places, low places, tightly enclosed spaces, boats, cars, planes, trains, crowds. . . . Through her observations of herself and those around her, Bettina seeks meaning in her exceedingly dreary life. Her frank examinations lead to many changes, including an extramarital fling, and her voice touches a timeless nerve, resonating on many levels--from the ever-evolving feminist consciousness to the gnawing existential search that is universal.<br /><br /><i>Diary of a Mad Housewife</i>'s humor and insight are as alive and pertinent today as they were yesterday, and will charm and disarm men and women of any generation.",

Instead, Pascal left a mass of fragments, some of them meant as notes for the Apologie. These became known as the Pensees, and they occupy a crucial place in Western philosophy and religious writing. This translation is the only one based on the Pensees as Pascal left them. It includes the principal dossiers classified by Pascal, as well as the essential portion of his important Writings on Grace.\"",

    "description": "<b>National Bestseller\u00a0</b><br /><br />He was the foremost American of his day, yet today he is little more than a mythic caricature in the public imagination. Benjamin Franklin, perhaps <i>the </i>pivotal figure in colonial and revolutionary America, comes vividly to life in this masterly biography.<br /><br />Wit, diplomat, scientist, philosopher, businessman, inventor, and bon vivant, Benjamin Franklin was in every respect America\u2019s first Renaissance man. From penniless runaway to highly successful printer, from ardently loyal subject of Britain to architect of an alliance with France that ensured America\u2019s independence, Franklin went from obscurity to become one of the world\u2019s most admired figures, whose circle included the likes of Voltaire, Hume, Burke, and Kant. Drawing on previously unpublished letters and a host of other sources, acclaimed historian H. W. Brands has written a thoroughly engaging biography of the eighteenth-century genius. A much needed reminder of Franklin\u2019s greatness and humanity,<b> The First American</b><i> </i>is a work of meticulous scholarship that provides a magnificent tour of a legendary historical figure, a vital era in American life, and the countless arenas in which the protean Franklin left his legacy.",

    "description": "Recording the opinions of childless women from all over the world and letting this growing band answer their detractors, this investigation looks into the world of those who choose not to have children. Interviewees speak freely and honestly about their experiences, providing readers with both the many reasons people choose to live child-free and insight into what seems to them an unhealthy amount of societal pressure to become mothers and fathers. This book also presents interviews with parents who wish they had not had children while offering their reasons for feeling regret. Concluding with a look into the workplace, this title evaluates the fairness of allowing parents shorter days and time off to accommodate children, compared to the working environment of those who have chosen to live without children.<br />",

    "description": "<div><b>From the authors of Manifesta, an activism handbook that illustrates how to truly make the personal political.</b><br /><br /><i>Grassroots</i> is an activism handbook for social justice. Aimed at everyone from students to professionals, stay-at-home moms to artists, <i>Grassroots</i> answers the perennial question: What can I do? Whether you are concerned about the environment, human rights violations in Tibet, campus sexual assault policies, sweatshop labor, gay marriage, or the ongoing repercussions from 9-11, Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy Richards believe that we all have something to offer in the fight against injustice. <br /><br />Based on the authors' own experiences, and the stories of both the large number of activists they work with as well as the countless everyday people they have encountered over the years, <i>Grassroots</i> encourages people to move beyond the \"generic three\" (check writing, calling congresspeople, and volunteering) and make a difference with clear guidelines and models for activism. The authors draw heavily on individual stories as examples, inspiring readers to recognize the tools right in front of them--be it the office copier or the family living room--in order to make change. <br /><br />Activism is accessible to all, and <i>Grassroots</i> shows how anyone, no matter how much or little time they have to offer, can create a world that more clearly reflects their values. <br /></div>",

    "description": "Regarded by many as the finest, and funniest, comic novel of the twentieth century, <i>Lucky Jim</i> remains as trenchant, withering, and eloquently misanthropic as when it first scandalized readers in 1954. This is the story of Jim Dixon, a hapless lecturer in medieval history at a provincial university who knows better than most that \u201cthere was no end to the ways in which nice things are nicer than nasty ones.\u201d Kingsley Amis\u2019s scabrous debut leads the reader through a gallery of emphatically English bores, cranks, frauds, and neurotics with whom Dixon must contend in one way or another in order to hold on to his cushy academic perch and win the girl of his fancy.<br /><br />More than just a merciless satire of cloistered college life and stuffy postwar manners, <i>Lucky Jim</i> is an attack on the forces of boredom, whatever form they may take, and a work of art that at once distills and extends an entire tradition of English comic writing, from Fielding and Dickens through Wodehouse and Waugh. As Christopher Hitchens has written, \u201cIf you can picture Bertie or Jeeves being capable of actual malice, and simultaneously imagine Evelyn Waugh forgetting about original sin, you have the combination of innocence and experience that makes this short romp so imperishable.\u201d",

    "description": "The term \"biography\" seems insufficiently capacious to describe the singular achievement of Joseph Frank's five-volume study of the life of the great Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky. One critic, writing upon the publication of the final volume, casually tagged the series as the ultimate work on Dostoevsky \"in any language, and quite possibly forever.\"<br /><br />Frank himself had not originally intended to undertake such a massive work. The endeavor began in the early 1960s as an exploration of Dostoevsky's fiction, but it later became apparent to Frank that a deeper appreciation of the fiction would require a more ambitious engagement with the writer's life, directly caught up as Dostoevsky was with the cultural and political movements of mid- and late-nineteenth-century Russia. Already in his forties, Frank undertook to learn Russian and embarked on what would become a five-volume work comprising more than 2,500 pages. The result is an intellectual history of nineteenth-century Russia, with Dostoevsky's mind as a refracting prism.<br /><br />The volumes have won numerous prizes, among them the National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography, the Christian Gauss Award of Phi Beta Kappa, the <i>Los Angeles Times Book Prize</i>, and the James Russell Lowell Prize of the Modern Language Association.",

Evans's three-volume history of Nazi Germany was hailed by Benjamin Schwartz of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> as \"the definitive English-language account... gripping and precise.\" It chronicles the incredible story of Germany's radical reshaping under Nazi rule. As those who were deemed unworthy to be counted among the German people were dealt with in increasingly brutal terms, Hitler's drive to prepare Germany for the war that he saw as its destiny reached its fateful hour in September 1939. <i>The Third Reich in Power</i> is the fullest and most authoritative account yet written of how, in six years, Germany was brought to the edge of that terrible abyss.",

Roth is intent on stopping him, even if that means impersonating his own impersonator. <br /><br />With excruciating suspense, unfettered philosophical speculation, and a cast of characters that includes Israeli intelligence agents, Palestinian exiles, an accused war criminal, and an enticing charter member of an organization called Anti-Semites Anonymous, <b>Operation Shylock</b> barrels across the frontier between fact and fiction, seriousness and high comedy, history and nightmare.",

Raised by a mysterious group of rational philosophers known only by numbers, the boy and his mother-a princess in exile from a faraway land-are the only people in their household assigned names. As the boy's regal mother, Cassiopeia, entertains the house scholars with her beauty and wit, young Octavian begins to question the purpose behind his guardians' fanatical studies. Only after he dares to open a forbidden door does he learn the hideous nature of their experiments-and his own chilling role in them.",

    "description": "<strong>A real-life thriller, now in paperback--the true story of the unheralded American who brought the Barbary Pirates to their knees</strong> In an attempt to stop the legendary Barbary Pirates of North Africa from hijacking American ships, William Eaton set out on a secret mission to overthrow the government of Tripoli. The operation was sanctioned by President Thomas Jefferson, who at the last moment grew wary of \"intermeddling\" in a foreign government and sent Eaton off without proper national support. Short on supplies, given very little money and only a few men, Eaton and his mission seemed doomed from the start. He triumphed against all odds, recruited a band of European mercenaries in Alexandria, and led them on a march across the Libyan Desert. Once in Tripoli, the ragtag army defeated the local troops and successfully captured Derne, laying the groundwork for the demise of the Barbary Pirates. Now, Richard Zacks brings this important story of America's first overseas covert op to life.",

    "description": "Self-help: To millions of Americans it seems like a godsend. To many others it seems like a joke. But as investigative reporter Steve Salerno reveals in this groundbreaking book, it\u2019s neither\u2014in fact it\u2019s much worse than a joke. Going deep inside the Self-Help and Actualization Movement (fittingly, the words form the acronym SHAM), Salerno offers the first serious expos\u00e9 of this multibillion-dollar industry and the real damage it is doing\u2014not just to its paying customers, but to all of American society. <br /><br />Based on the author\u2019s extensive reporting\u2014and the inside look at the industry he got while working at a leading \u201clifestyle\u201d publisher\u2014<i>SHAM</i> shows how thinly credentialed \u201cexperts\u201d now dispense advice on everything from mental health to relationships to diet to personal finance to business strategy. Americans spend upward of $8 billion every year on self-help programs and products. And those staggering financial costs are actually the least of our worries.<br /><br /><i>SHAM</i> demonstrates how the self-help movement\u2019s core philosophies have infected virtually every aspect of American life\u2014the home, the workplace, the schools, and more. And Salerno exposes the downside of being uplifted, showing how the \u201cempowering\u201d message that dominates self-help today proves just as damaging as the blame-shifting rhetoric of self-help\u2019s \u201cRecovery\u201d movement.<br /><br /><i>SHAM</i> also reveals:<br /><br />\u2022 How self-help gurus conduct extensive market research to reach the same customers over and over\u2014without ever helping them<br /><br />\u2022 The inside story on the most notorious gurus\u2014from Dr. Phil to Dr. Laura, from Tony Robbins to John Gray<br /><br />\u2022 How your company might be wasting money on motivational speakers, \u201cexecutive coaches,\u201d and other quick fixes that often hurt quality, productivity, and morale<br /><br />\u2022 How the Recovery movement has eradicated notions of personal responsibility by labeling just about anything\u2014from drug abuse to \u201csex addiction\u201d to shoplifting\u2014a dysfunction or disease<br /><br />\u2022 How Americans blindly accept that twelve-step programs offer the only hope of treating addiction, when in fact these programs can do more harm than good<br /><br />\u2022 How the self-help movement inspired the disastrous emphasis on self-esteem in our schools<br /><br />\u2022 How self-help rhetoric has pushed people away from proven medical treatments by persuading them that they can cure themselves through sheer application of will <br /><br />As Salerno shows, to describe self-help as a waste of time and money vastly understates its collateral damage. And with <i>SHAM</i>, the self-help industry has finally been called to account for the damage it has done.<br /><br /><br />Also available as an eBook<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "<b>A remarkable, elegantly written portrait of four autistic men and women, and what their struggles and triumphs reveal about this baffling condition, and about us all. </b><br /><br />In 1982, when he was four years old, Kamran Nazeer was enrolled in a small school in New York City alongside a dozen other children diagnosed with autism. Calling themselves the Idiots, these kids received care that was at the cutting edge of developmental psychology. Twenty-three years later, the school no longer exists.<br /><br /><i>Send in the Idiots</i> is the always candid, often surprising, and ultimately moving investigation into what happened to those children. Now a policy adviser in England, Kamran decides to visit four of his old classmates to find out the kind of lives that they are living now, how much they've been able to overcome\u2014and what remains missing. A speechwriter unable to make eye contact; a messenger who gets upset if anyone touches his bicycle; a depressive suicide victim; and a computer engineer who communicates difficult emotions through the use of hand puppets: these four classmates reveal an astonishing, thought-provoking spectrum of behavior.<br /><br />Bringing to life the texture of autistic lives and the pressures and limitations that the condition presents, Kamran also relates the ways in which those can be eased over time, and with the right treatment. Using his own experiences to examine such topics as the difficulties of language, conversation as performance, and the politics of civility, <i>Send in the Idiots</i> is also a rare and provocative exploration of the way that people\u2014all people\u2014learn to think and feel. Written with unmatched insight and striking personal testimony, Kamran Nazeer's account is a stunning, invaluable, and utterly unique contribution to the literature of what makes us human.",

    "description": "A translation of one of the single most important works of recent French philosophy, Badiou's magnum opus. Being and Event is the greatest work of Alain Badiou, France's most important living philosopher. Long-awaited in translation, Being and Event makes available to an English-speaking readership Badiou's groundbreaking work on set theory - the cornerstone of his whole philosophy. The book makes the scope and aim of Badiou's whole philosophical project clear, enabling full comprehension of Badiou's significance for contemporary philosophy. Badiou draws upon and is fully engaged with the European philosophical tradition from Plato onwards; Being and Event deals with such key figures as Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel, Rousseau, Heidegger and Lacan.",

    "description": "In 1999, after a series of wildly adventurous jobs around the world, Sam Sheridan found himself in Australia, loaded with cash and intent on not working until he\u2019d spent it all. It occurred to him that, without distractions, he could finally indulge a long-dormant obsession:\u00a0fighting. Within a year, he was in Bangkok training with the greatest fighter in muay Thai (Thai kickboxing) history and stepping through the ropes for a professional bout. That one fight wasn\u2019t enough. Sheridan set out to test himself on an epic journey into how and why we fight, facing Olympic boxers, Brazilian jiu-jitsu stars, and Ultimate Fighting champions. Along the way, Sheridan delivers an insightful look at violence as a career and a spectator sport, a behind-the-pageantry glimpse of athletes at the top of their terrifying game.\u00a0 An extraordinary combination of gonzo journalism and participatory sports writing, <i>A Fighter\u2019s Heart</i> is a dizzying first-hand account of what it\u2019s like to reach the peak of finely disciplined personal aggression, to hit\u2014and be hit.",

The Admiralty has ordered Captain Horatio Hornblower, now in command of the thirty-six-gun HMS Lydia, to form an alliance against the Spanish colonial government with an insane Spanish landowner; to find a water route across the Central American isthmus; and \"to take, sink, burn or destroy\" the fifty-gun Spanish ship of the line Natividad or face court-martial. A daunting enough set of orders-even if the happily married captain were not woefully distracted by the passenger he is obliged to take on in Panama: Lady Barbara Wellesley.",

    "description": "In a summer that refuses to end, in the deceiving warmth of earliest October, civil war has come to Green Town, Illinois. It is the age-old conflict: the young against the elderly, for control of the clock that ticks their lives ever forward. The first cap-pistol shot heard 'round the town is dead accurate, felling an old man in his tracks, compelling town elder and school board despot Mr. Calvin C. Quartermain to marshal his graying forces and declare total war on the assassin, thirteen-year-old Douglas Spaudling, and his downy-checked cohorts. Doug and his cronies, however, are most worthy adversaries who should not be underestimated, as they plan and execute daring campaigns-matching old Quartermain's experience and cunning with their youthful enthusiasm and devil-may-care determination to hold on forever to childhood's summer. Yet time must ultimately be the victor, with valuable revelations for those on both sides of the conflicts. And life waits in ambush to assail Doug Spaulding with its powerful mysteries-the irresistible ascent of manhood, the sweet surrender to a first kiss-",

In an Adventure with Scientists</i>, featuring the greatest sea-faring hero of all time, the immortal Pirate Captain, who, although he lives for months at a time at sea, somehow manages to keep his beard silky and in good condition.<br /><br />Worried that his pirates are growing bored with a life of winking at pretty native ladies and trying to stick enough jellyfish together to make a bouncy castle, the Pirate Captain decides it's high time to spearhead an adventure. <br /><br />While searching for some major pirate booty, he mistakenly attacks the young Charles Darwin's Beagle and then leads his ragtag crew from the exotic Galapagos Islands to the fog-filled streets of Victorian London. There they encounter grisly murder, vanishing ladies, radioactive elephants, and the Holy Ghost himself. And that's not even the half of it.",

    "description": "London, 1840: Wagner\u2019s latest opera plays to packed houses while disgruntled workers gather in crowded pubs to eat ice cream and plan the downfall of the bourgeoisie. And the Pirate Captain\u2013\u2013his disguise proving something of a letdown\u2013\u2013finds himself incarcerated at Scotland Yard, in a case of mistaken identity.<br /><br />Discovering that his doppelg\u00e4nger is none other than Karl Marx, the Captain and his crew are unwittingly caught up in a sinister plot that involves a red-eyed monster, stolen waxworks, and a sack of pretend kittens.<br /><br />From the gloomy streets of Soho to the leafy boulevards of Paris, The Pirates! In an Adventure with Communists is a story of intellectual giants, enormous beards, volcanoes and valkyries, doubloons and dancing girls, and a quest to discover whether ham might really be the opium of the people.<br /><br />This volume also includes, at no additional charge, <i>The Wit and Wisdom of the Pirate Captain\u2013\u2013a Major Philosophical Work<br /></i><br /><b>On the Matter of Love:<br /></b><br />If you\u2019re off to fight in a battle, snap a ship\u2019s biscuit in half and give your girlfriend the other half. When you meet again, they will match\u2013\u2013like two halves of a single soul! Hopefully, this will stop her sleeping with other men.<br /><b><br />On the Question of Gravy Stains:<br /></b><br />It is my opinion that the best way to get gravy stains out of cotton or wool is to soak the fabric in vinegar for half an hour. . . . If this doesn\u2019t work, try burning the gravy off with a match or getting a hungry dog to lick it off.<br /><b><br />On Life in General:<br /></b><br />Life is like a big shanty. Everything will be fine so long as everyone sings in harmony. But if someone plays a duff note on the accordion or tries to break-dance at a sensitive bit, then there will be all sorts of trouble, mark my words.",

There has never been anything like it\".--\"Rolling Stone\". 80 b&amp;w photos. 16-page color insert.<br /><br /><br />In his twenty-nine years, rock idol Manson has experienced more than most people have (or would want to) in a lifetime. Now, in his shocking and candid memoir, he takes readers from backstage to gaol cells, from recording studios to emergency rooms, from the pit of despair to the top of the charts, and recounts his metamorphosis from a frightened Christian schoolboy into the most feared and revered music superstar in the country.",

    "description": "As writers of English from Australia to India to Sri Lanka command our attention, Salman Rushdie can state confidently that English fiction was moribund until the Empire wrote back, and few, even among the British, demur. A. S. Byatt does, and her case is persuasive. In a series of essays on the complicated relations between reading, writing, and remembering, the gifted novelist and critic sorts the modish from the merely interesting and the truly good to arrive at a new view of British writing in our time.<br /><br />Whether writing about the renaissance of the historical novel, discussing her own translation of historical fact into fiction, or exploring the recent European revival of interest in myth, folklore, and fairytale, Byatt's abiding concern here is with the interplay of fiction and history. Her essays amount to an eloquent and often moving meditation on the commitment to historical narrative and storytelling that she shares with many of her British and European contemporaries. With copious illustration and abundant insights into writers from Elizabeth Bowen and Henry Green to Anthony Burgess, William Golding, Muriel Spark, Penelope Fitzgerald, Julian Barnes, Martin Amis, Hilary Mantel, and Pat Barker, <i>On Histories and Stories</i> is an oblique defense of the art Byatt practices and a map of the complex affiliations of British and European narrative since 1945.",

In the still darkness of their cell, Molina re-weaves the glittering and fragile stories of the film he loves, and the cynical Valentin listens. Valentin believes in the just cause which makes all suffering bearable; Molina believes in the magic of love which makes all else endurable. Each has always been alone, and always - especially now - in danger of betrayal. But in cell 7 each surrenders to the other something of himself that he has never surrendered before.",

    "description": "There were dozens of books about Watergate, but only <b>All the President's Men</b> gave readers the full story, with all the drama and nuance and exclusive reporting. And thirty years later, if you're going to read only one book on Watergate, that's still the one. Today, Enron is the biggest business story of our time, and <b>Fortune</b> senior writers Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind are the new Woodward and Bernstein.<br /><br />Remarkably, it was just two years ago that Enron was thought to epitomize a great New Economy company, with its skyrocketing profits and share price. But that was before <b>Fortune</b> published an article by McLean that asked a seemingly innocent question: How exactly does Enron make money? From that point on, Enron's house of cards began to crumble. Now, McLean and Elkind have investigated much deeper, to offer the definitive book about the Enron scandal and the fascinating people behind it.<br /><br />Meticulously researched and character driven, <b>Smartest Guys in the Room</b> takes the reader deep into Enron's past\u2014and behind the closed doors of private meetings. Drawing on a wide range of unique sources, the book follows Enron's rise from obscurity to the top of the business world to its disastrous demise. It reveals as never before major characters such as Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and Andy Fastow, as well as lesser known players like Cliff Baxter and Rebecca Mark. <b>Smartest Guys in the Room</b> is a story of greed, arrogance, and deceit\u2014a microcosm of all that is wrong with American business today. Above all, it's a fascinating human drama that will prove to be the authoritative account of the Enron scandal.",

    "description": "Simon Winchester, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Professor and the Madman</em>, examines the legendary annihilation in 1883 of the volcano-island of Krakatoa, which was followed by an immense tsunami that killed nearly forty thousand people. The effects of the immense waves were felt as far away as France. Barometers in Bogot\u00e1 and Washington, D.C., went haywire. Bodies were washed up in Zanzibar. The sound of the island's destruction was heard in Australia and India and on islands thousands of miles away. Most significant of all -- in view of today's new political climate -- the eruption helped to trigger in Java a wave of murderous anti-Western militancy among fundamentalist Muslims, one of the first outbreaks of Islamic-inspired killings anywhere. <em>Krakatoa</em> gives us an entirely new perspective on this fascinating and iconic event.",

    "description": "The Ivy League is full of societies and clubs, some public and some very private. But none is as secret as Yale's Skull and Bones, a tiny, mysterious society that has spawned three U.S. presidents, including William H. Taft, George W. Bush, and his father. Skull and Bones' cloak-and-dagger secrecy has prompted people worldwide to attribute to it some of the most staggering conspiracies in modern history-as well as events including the drop of the atom bomb, the rise of Hitler, and the invasion of the Bay of Pigs. From their nearly windowless crypt in the middle of the Yale campus, the Bonesmen, it is said, plot to dominate the world. In Secrets of the Tomb, acclaimed journalist Alexandra Robbins slips through the veil of secrecy to investigate, through society documents and interviews with dozens of members, the truth about Skull and Bones' influence and operations. She also explains why this old-boy 19th century throwback, a product of another time, still thrives in 21st-century America.",

    "description": "Simon Winchester vividly brings to life the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake that leveled a city symbolic of America's relentless western expansion, and fashions an enthralling and informative look at the tumultuous subterranean world that produces earthquakes, the planet's most sudden and destructive force.<br /><br />Winchester applies his inimitable storytelling abilities (as well as his understanding of geology) to this extraordinary event, exploring not only what happened in northern California in 1906 but what we have learned since about the geological underpinnings that caused the earthquake in the first place. But his achievement is even greater: he positions the quake's significance along the earth's geological timeline and shows the effect it had on the rest of 20th-century California and American history.<br /><br />[from the flyleaf: \"<i>This signed edition of A Crack in the Edge of the World by Simon Winchester has been specially bound by the publisher</i>.\"] The dust jacket of this edition folds out into a large poster-sized facsimile of the front page of a San Francisco newspaper published on April 19, 1906.",

For this new edition, Lakoff adds a preface and an afterword extending his observations to major ideological conflicts since the book's original publication, from the impeachment of Bill Clinton to the 2000 presidential election and its aftermath.<br />",

    "description": "Whence Henry Miller's title for this, one of his most appealing books; first published in 1957, it tells the story of Miller's life on the Big Sur, a section of California coast where he lived for fifteen years.<br /><br />Big Sur is the portrait of a place one of the most colorful in the U.S. and of the extraordinary people Miller knew there: writers (and writers who didn't write), mystics seeking truth in meditation (and the not-so-saintly looking for sex-cults or celebrity), sophisticated children and adult innocents; geniuses, cranks and the unclassifiable.<br /><br />Henry Miller writes with a buoyancy and brimming energy that are infectious. He has a fine touch for comedy. But this is also a serious book the testament of a free spirit who has broken through the restraints and cliches of modern life to find within himself his own kind of paradise.<br /><br />",

Eleven-year-old Lucius Priest is persuaded by Boon Hogganbeck, one of his family's retainers, to steal his grandfather's car and make a trip to Memphis. The Priests' black coachman, Ned McCaslin, stows away, and the three of them are off on a heroic odyssey, for which they are all ill-equipped, that ends at Miss Reba's bordello in Memphis. From there a series of wild misadventures ensues--invoving horse smuggling, trainmen, sheriffs' deputies, and jail.",

If someone really believes that the 16th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama is the one true incarnation, or that God is love, or that his grandfather's spirit lives in a tree, Edgar reasons he should be willing to bet money on it. <br />Edgar is right. The metaphysical betting shops become incredibly popular as people of all faiths rush to outdo each other. After placing a bet, the bettor is given a receipt verifying the bet and amount, and a button with a question mark, stamped \"Who knows?\" It's no wonder that Edgar goes on to become the richest man in the world.<br /><br />As the competitive rage spreads, the betting shops indirectly cause a dangerous faith war, resulting in multiple popes, a beautiful messianic woman who claims to be God's messenger, and a technological meltdown with artificially intelligent home appliances. Meanwhile, there's an optimistic supermarket trolley climbing Mt. Everest, looking for God...",

    "description": "The work that helped to determine Paul Feyerabend's fame and notoriety, <i>Against Method,</i> stemmed from Imre Lakatos's challenge: \"In 1970 Imre cornered me at a party. 'Paul,' he said, 'you have such strange ideas. Why don't you write them down? I shall write a reply, we publish the whole thing and I promise you\u2014we shall have a lot of fun.' \" Although Lakatos died before he could write his reply, <i>For and Against Method</i> reconstructs his original counter-arguments from lectures and correspondence previously unpublished in English, allowing us to enjoy the \"fun\" two of this century's most eminent philosophers had, matching their wits and ideas on the subject of the scientific method.<br /><br /><i>For and Against Method</i> opens with an imaginary dialogue between Lakatos and Feyerabend, which Matteo Motterlini has constructed, based on their published works, to synthesize their positions and arguments. Part one presents the transcripts of the last lectures on method that Lakatos delivered. Part two, Feyerabend's response, consists of a previously published essay on anarchism, which began the attack on Lakatos's position that Feyerabend later continued in <i>Against Method.</i> The third and longest section consists of the correspondence Lakatos and Feyerabend exchanged on method and many other issues and ideas, as well as the events of their daily lives, between 1968 and Lakatos's death in 1974.<br /><br />The delight Lakatos and Feyerabend took in philosophical debate, and the relish with which they sparred, come to life again in <i>For and Against Method,</i> making it essential and lively reading for anyone interested in these two fascinating and controversial thinkers and their immense contributions to philosophy of science.<br /><br />\"The writings in this volume are of considerable intellectual importance, and will be of great interest to anyone concerned with the development of the philosophical views of Lakatos and Feyerabend, or indeed with the development of philosophy of science in general during this crucial period.\"\u2014Donald Gillies, <i>British Journal for the Philosophy of Science</i> (on the Italian edition)<br /><br />\"A stimulating exchange of letters between two philosophical entertainers.\"\u2014Tariq Ali, <i>The Independent</i><br /><br />Imre Lakatos (1922-1974) was professor of logic at the London School of Economics. He was the author of <i>Proofs and Refutations</i> and the two-volume <i>Philosophical Papers</i>. Paul Feyerabend (1924-1994) was educated in Europe and held numerous teaching posts throughout his career. Among his books are <i>Against Method</i>; <i>Science in a Free Society</i>; <i>Farewell to Reason</i>; and <i>Killing Time: The Autobiography of Paul Feyerabend</i>, the last published by the University of Chicago Press.",

    "description": "In <i>The Queen of America Goes to Washington City</i>, Lauren Berlant focuses on the need to revitalize public life and political agency in the United States. Delivering a devastating critique of contemporary discourses of American citizenship, she addresses the triumph of the idea of private life over that of public life borne in the right-wing agenda of the Reagan revolution. By beaming light onto the idealized images and narratives about sex and citizenship that now dominate the U.S. public sphere, Berlant argues that the political public sphere has become an intimate public sphere. She asks why the contemporary ideal of citizenship is measured by personal and private acts and values rather than civic acts, and the ideal citizen has become one who, paradoxically, cannot yet act as a citizen\u2014epitomized by the American child and the American fetus. <br />As Berlant traces the guiding images of U.S. citizenship through the process of privatization, she discusses the ideas of intimacy that have come to define national culture. From the fantasy of the American dream to the lessons of Forrest Gump, Lisa Simpson to Queer Nation, the reactionary culture of imperilled privilege to the testimony of Anita Hill, Berlant charts the landscape of American politics and culture. She examines the consequences of a shrinking and privatized concept of citizenship on increasing class, racial, sexual, and gender animosity and explores the contradictions of a conservative politics that maintains the sacredness of privacy, the virtue of the free market, and the immorality of state overregulation\u2014except when it comes to issues of intimacy. <br />Drawing on literature, the law, and popular media, <i>The Queen of America Goes to Washington City</i> is a stunning and major statement about the nation and its citizens in an age of mass mediation. As it opens a critical space for new theory of agency, its narratives and gallery of images will challenge readers to rethink what it means to be American and to seek salvation in its promise.",

A masterpiece of technical exposition, it was the basic textbook of astronomy for more than a thousand years, and still is the main source for our knowledge of ancient astronomy. This translation, based on the standard Greek text of Heiberg, makes the work accessible to English readers in an intelligible and reliable form. It contains numerous corrections derived from medieval Arabic translations and extensive footnotes that take account of the great progress in understanding the work made in this century, due to the discovery of Babylonian records and other researches. It is designed to stand by itself as an interpretation of the original, but it will also be useful as an aid to reading the Greek text.</p><p></p>",

    "description": "Green Lion Press has prepared a new one-volume edition of T.L. Heath's translation of the thirteen books of Euclid's <i>Elements</i>. In keeping with Green Lion's design commitment, diagrams have been placed on every spread for convenient reference while working through the proofs; running heads on every page indicate both Euclid's book number and proposition numbers for that page; and adequate space for notes is allowed between propositions and around diagrams. The all-new index has built into it a glossary of Euclid's Greek terms.<br /><br />Heath's translation has stood the test of time, and, as one done by a renowned scholar of ancient mathematics, it can be relied upon not to have inadvertantly introduced modern concepts or nomenclature. <br /><br />We have excised the voluminous historical and scholarly commentary that swells the Dover edition to three volumes and impedes classroom use of the original text. The single volume is not only more convenient, but less expensive as well.",

Reflecting his lifelong interest in Arthurian themes, his primary sources were Malory's Morte d'Arthur and the Welsh Mabinogion. For him, the Idylls embodied the universal and unending war between sense and soul, and Arthur the highest ideals of manhood and kingship; an attitude totally compatible with the moral outlook of his age. Poetically, Tennyson was heir to the Romantics, and Keats's influence in particular can be seen clearly in much of his work. Yet Tennyson's style is undoubtedly his own and he achieved a delicacy of phrase and subtlety of metrical effect that are unmatched. This edition, based on the text authorized by Tennyson himself, contains full critical apparatus.",

    "description": "Crime and Punishment (1866) is the story of a murder committed on principle, of a killer who wishes by his action to set himself outside and above society. A novel of great physical and psychological tension, pervaded by Dostoevsky's sinister evocation of St Petersburg, it also has moments of wild humour. Dostoevsky's own harrowing experiences mark the novel. He had himself undergone interrogation and trial, and was condemned to death, a sentence commuted at the last moment to penal servitude. In prison he was particularly impressed by one hardened murderer who seemed to have attained a spiritual equilibrium beyond good and evil: yet witnessing the misery of other convicts also engendered in Dostoevsky a belief in the Christian idea of salvation through suffering.",

    "description": "Janisse Ray grew up in a junkyard along U.S. Highway 1, hidden from Florida-bound vacationers by the hedge at the edge of the road and by hulks of old cars and stacks of blown-out tires. Ecology of a Cracker Childhood tells how a childhood spent in rural isolation and steeped in religious fundamentalism grew into a passion to save the almost vanished longleaf pine ecosystem that once covered the South. In language at once colloquial, elegiac, and informative, Ray redeems two Souths. \"Suffused with the same history-haunted sense of loss that imprints so much of the South and its literature. What sets Ecology of a Cracker Childhood apart is the ambitious and arresting mission implied in its title. . . . Heartfelt and refreshing.\" - The New York Times Book Review.",

    "description": "\"CAN YOU FEEL THIS?\"<br /><br />Chuck Palahniuk, the bestselling author of <i>Fight Club</i>, <i>Choke</i>, and <i>Lullaby</i> continues his twenty-first-century reinvention of the horror novel in this scary and profound look at our quest for some sort of immortality.<br /><br /><i>Diary</i> takes the form of a \"coma diary\" kept by one Misty Tracy Wilmot as her husband lies senseless in a hospital after a suicide attempt. Once she was an art student dreaming of creativity and freedom; now, after marrying Peter at school and being brought back to once quaint, now tourist-overrun Waytansea Island, she's been reduced to the condition of a resort hotel maid. Peter, it turns out, has been hiding rooms in houses he's remodeled and scrawling vile messages all over the walls\u2014an old habit of builders but dramatically overdone in Peter's case. Angry homeowners are suing left and right, and Misty's dreams of artistic greatness are in ashes. But then, as if possessed by the spirit of Maura Kinkaid, a fabled Waytansea artist of the nineteenth century, Misty begins painting again, compulsively. But can her newly discovered talent be part of a larger, darker plan? Of course it can...<br /><br /><i>Diary</i> is a dark, hilarious, and poignant act of storytelling from America's favorite, most inventive nihilist. It is Chuck Palahniuk's finest novel yet.",

    "description": "Does the number of children gunned down double each year? Does anorexia kill 150,000 young women annually? Do white males account for only a sixth of new workers? Startling statistics shape our thinking about social issues. But all too often, these numbers are wrong. This book is a lively guide to spotting bad statistics and learning to think critically about these influential numbers. <i>Damned Lies and Statistics </i>is essential reading for everyone who reads or listens to the news, for students, and for anyone who relies on statistical information to understand social problems.<br /><br />Joel Best bases his discussion on a wide assortment of intriguing contemporary issues that have garnered much recent media attention, including abortion, cyberporn, homelessness, the Million Man March, teen suicide, the U.S. census, and much more. Using examples from the <i>New York Times, </i>the <i>Washington Post, </i>and other major newspapers and television programs, he unravels many fascinating examples of the use, misuse, and abuse of statistical information.<br /><br />In this book Best shows us exactly how and why bad statistics emerge, spread, and come to shape policy debates. He recommends specific ways to detect bad statistics, and shows how to think more critically about \"stat wars,\" or disputes over social statistics among various experts. Understanding this book does not require sophisticated mathematical knowledge; Best discusses the most basic and most easily understood forms of statistics, such as percentages, averages, and rates.<br /><br />This accessible book provides an alternative to either naively accepting the statistics we hear or cynically assuming that all numbers are meaningless. It shows how anyone can become a more intelligent, critical, and empowered consumer of the statistics that inundate both the social sciences and our media-saturated lives.",

    "description": "A married person falls deeply in love with someone else. A man of average income feels he cannot be truly happy unless he owns an expensive luxury car. A dieter has an irresistible craving for ice cream. Desires often come to us unbidden and unwanted, and they can have a dramatic impact, sometimes changing the course of our lives. <br /> In On Desire, William B. Irvine takes us on a wide-ranging tour of our impulses, wants, and needs, showing us where these feelings come from and how we can try to rein them in. Spicing his account with engaging observations by writers like Seneca, Tolstoy, and Freud, Irvine considers the teachings of Buddhists, Hindus, the Amish, Shakers, and Catholic saints, as well as those of ancient Greek and Roman and modern European philosophers. Irvine also looks at what modern science can tell us about desire--what happens in the brain when we desire something and how animals evolved particular desires--and he advances a new theory about how desire itself evolved. Irvine also suggests that at the same time that we gained the ability to desire, we were \"programmed\" to find some things more desirable than others. Irvine concludes that the best way to attain lasting happiness is not to change the world around us or our place in it, but to change ourselves. If we can convince ourselves to want what we already have, we can dramatically enhance our happiness. <br /> Brimming with wisdom and practical advice, On Desire offers a thoughtful approach to controlling unwanted passions and attaining a more meaningful life.",

    "description": "Why do we feel the way we feel? How do our thoughts and emotions affect our health? Are our bodies and minds distinct from each other or do they function together as parts of an interconnected system? <br /> In her groundbreaking book <i>Molecules of Emotion,</i> Candace Pert provides startling and decisive answers to these and other challenging questions that scientists and philosophers have pondered for centuries. <br /> Her pioneering research on how the chemicals inside our bodies form a dynamic information network, linking mind and body, is not only provocative, it is revolutionary. By establishing the biomolecular basis for our emotions and explaining these new scientific developments in a clear and accessible way, Pert empowers us to understand ourselves, our feelings, and the connection between our minds and our bodies -- body-minds -- in ways we could never possibly have imagined before. <br /><i>Molecules of Emotion</i> is a landmark work, full of insight and wisdom and possessing that rare power to change the way we see the world and ourselves.",

McKillip presents her first contemporary fantasy in many years-a tale of the tangled lives mere mortals lead, when they turn their eyes from the beauty and mystery that lie just outside of the everyday...<br /><br />When bookstore owner Sylvia Lynn returns to her childhood home in upstate New York, she meets the Fiber Guild-a group of local women who meet to knit, embroider, and sew-and learns why her grandmother watches her so closely. A primitive power exists in the forest, a force the Fiber Guild seeks to bind in its stitches and weavings. And Sylvia is no stranger to the woods",

    "description": "The ancient Greek lyric poet Simonides of Keos was the first poet in the Western tradition to take money for poetic composition. From this starting point, Anne Carson launches an exploration, poetic in its own right, of the idea of poetic economy. She offers a reading of certain of Simonides' texts and aligns these with writings of the modern Romanian poet Paul Celan, a Jew and survivor of the Holocaust, whose \"economies\" of language are notorious. Asking such questions as, What is lost when words are wasted? and Who profits when words are saved? Carson reveals the two poets' striking commonalities.<br /><br /><br /> In Carson's view Simonides and Celan share a similar mentality or disposition toward the world, language and the work of the poet. <i>Economy of the Unlost</i> begins by showing how each of the two poets stands in a state of alienation between two worlds. In Simonides' case, the gift economy of fifth-century b.c. Greece was giving way to one based on money and commodities, while Celan's life spanned pre- and post-Holocaust worlds, and he himself, writing in German, became estranged from his native language. Carson goes on to consider various aspects of the two poets' techniques for coming to grips with the invisible through the visible world. A focus on the genre of the epitaph grants insights into the kinds of exchange the poets envision between the living and the dead. Assessing the impact on Simonidean composition of the material fact of inscription on stone, Carson suggests that a need for brevity influenced the exactitude and clarity of Simonides' style, and proposes a comparison with Celan's interest in the \"negative design\" of printmaking: both poets, though in different ways, employ a kind of negative image making, cutting away all that is superfluous. This book's juxtaposition of the two poets illuminates their differences--Simonides' fundamental faith in the power of the word, Celan's ultimate despair--as well as their similarities; it provides fertile ground for the virtuosic interplay of Carson's scholarship and her poetic sensibility.",

He reveals the hidden kitchens where Los Angeles' ethnic communities feed their own, including the best of cuisine from Argentina, Armenia, Brazil, Burma, Canton, Colombia, Cuba, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Middle East, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Peru, Thailand, Vietnam and more. Not to mention the perfectly prepared hamburger and Los Angeles' quintessential hot dog.<br /><br /><i>Counter Intelligence</i> is the richest and most complete guide to eating in Los Angeles. The listings include where to find it and how much you'll pay (in many cases, not very much) with appendices that cover food types and feeding by neighborhood.",

But try living on the mean streets as a child begging for food and fighting like a dog with ruthless gangs of starving kids who wouldn't hesitate to pound your skull into pulp for a scrap of apple. If Bean has learned anything on the streets, it's how to survive. And not with fists. He is way too small for that. But with brains.<br /><br />Bean is a genius with a magician's ability to zero in on his enemy and exploit his weakness.<br /><br />What better quality for a future general to lead the Earth in a final climactic battle against a hostile alien race, known as Buggers. At Battleschool Bean meets and befriends another future commander - Ender Wiggins - perhaps his only true rival.<br /><br />Only one problem: for Bean and Ender, the future is now.<br /><br /><i>Ender's Shadow</i> is the book that launched The Shadow Series, and the parallel novel to Orson Scott Card's science fiction classic, <i>Ender's Game</i>.",

    "description": "Not since Betty Eadie\u2019s <i>Embraced by the Light</i> has a personal account of a Near-Death Experience (NDE) been so utterly different from most others\u2014or nearly as compelling.<br /><br />In the thirty years since Raymond Moody\u2019s <i>Life After Life</i> appeared, a familiar pattern of NDEs has emerged: suddenly floating over one\u2019s own body, usually in a hospital setting, then a sudden hurtling through a tunnel of light toward a presence of love. <i>Not so</i> in Howard Storm\u2019s case.<br /><br />Storm, an avowed atheist, was awaiting emergency surgery when he realized that he was at death\u2019s door. Storm found himself out of his own body, looking down on the hospital room scene below. Next, rather than going \u201ctoward the light,\u201d he found himself being torturously dragged to excruciating realms of darkness and death, where he was physically assaulted by monstrous beings of evil. His description of his pure terror and torture is unnerving in its utter originality and convincing detail.<br /><br />Finally, drawn away from death and transported to the realm of heaven, Storm met angelic beings as well as the God of Creation. In this fascinating account, Storm tells of his \u201clife review,\u201d his conversation with God, even answers to age-old questions such as why the Holocaust was allowed to take place. Storm was sent back to his body with a new knowledge of the purpose of life here on earth. This book is his message of hope.<br /><br />\"This is a book you devour from cover to cover, and pass on to others. This is a book you will quote in your daily conversation. Storm was meant to write it and we were meant to read it.\"<br /><br />-From the foreward by Anne Rice<br /><br />As I lay on the ground, my tormentors swarming around me, a voice emerged from my chest. It sounded like my voice, but it wasn\u2019t a thought of mine. I didn\u2019t say it. The voice that sounded like my voice, but wasn\u2019t, said, \u201cPray to God.\u201d I remember thinking, \u201cWhy? What a stupid idea. That doesn\u2019t work. What a cop-out . . .\u201d <br /><br />That voice said it again, \u201cPray to God!\u201d It was more definite this time. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do. Praying, for me as a child, had been something I had watched adults doing. It was something fancy and had to be done just so. I tried to remember prayers from my childhood experiences in Sunday school. Prayer was something you memorized. What could I remember from so long ago? Tentatively, I murmured a line, which was a jumble from the Twenty-third Psalm, \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d the Lord\u2019s Prayer, the Pledge of Allegiance, and \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d and whatever other churchly sounding phrases came to mind.<br /><br />\u201cYea, though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. For purple mountain majesty, mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord. Deliver us from evil. One nation under God. God Bless America.\u201d<br /><br />To my amazement, the cruel, merciless beings tearing the life out of me were incited to rage by my ragged prayer. It was as if I were throwing boiling oil on them. They screamed at me, \u201cThere is no God! Who do you think you\u2019re talking to? Nobody can hear you! Now we are really going to hurt you.\u201d They spoke in the most obscene language, worse than any blasphemy said on earth. But at the same time, they were backing away.<br /><br />\u2014From <i>My Descent into Death</i>",

Charged with protecting his adopted city from enemies on both sides of its walls, he has led a charmed life as confidant to and protector of Zar Joreb for many years. But now Joreb is dead. . . .<br /><br />Though Joreb's well-intentioned fifteen-year-old heir, Boaz, will take the title of Zar, the balance of power lies in the hands of his beautiful and cruelly ambitious mother, a former harem slave who rose to power by the Zar's favor. Aside from Lazar, whom Boaz trusts and respects, the young Zar's only friend is Pez, the court jester, a misshapen dwarf whose tricks and diversions are accepted only because he is known to be mad.<br /><br />When a stunning young girl is brought to the palace to fill a space in Boaz's harem, both Boaz and Lazar are surprised by their unexpectedly strong reactions to her. But Ana, the odalisque, finds the closeted world of the harem stifling and unbearable. And unbeknownst to all, the gods themselves are beginning to rise in a cyclical battle that is just beginning, and will enmesh everyone in the palace in a struggle for the very soul of Percheron.",

Now, with the memories of his in-laws' magnificent fifty-year love affair as his guide, Wilson struggles to find his way back into the heart of the woman he adores.<br /><br /><i>Did You Know?---<br /><br />The Wedding is a follow-up to The Notebook?<br /><br />The Wedding was inspired by a few unnamed couples that Nicholas knows well?<br /><br />The novel is set in the North Carolina town in which Nicholas now lives?</i>",

The original story grew so long in the telling that it was split into two volumes: Beguilement (2006) and Legacy (2007). Bujold then wrote a sequel, which was also divided, into Passage (2008) and Horizon (2009). The original title of the sequel was The Wide Green World,[1] but Bujold and her publisher decided to make \"Sharing Knife\" the overall title, with the individual books given one-word subtitles and numbered 1\u20134. No further books are planned in the series.",

Each year, her people celebrate Moon-Flash-a spark of light that seems to come from and go into the moon, a symbol of life and joy. When a mysterious stranger arrives, Kyreol wants to know more about him, as well as the Moon-Flash, and soon she and her childhood friend Terje leave their home to look for answers. Those answers will pluck Kyreol from Riverworld and transform her life forever-by fast-forwarding her into a future she can barely comprehend.",

    "description": "Most people know the stories of <i>Snow White</i> and <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>, but very few know that behind the Brothers Grimm and their fairy tales stood a network of <i>sisters</i>-and mothers, neighbors, and female friends. In this intimate history, Valerie Paradiz tells the real story of the greatest literary collaboration of the nineteenth century, and gives the long-lost narrators of these beloved tales their due. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were major German intellects of their time, contemporaries of both Goethe and Schiller. But as Paradiz reveals here, the romantic image of the two brothers traveling the countryside, transcribing tales told to them by peasants, is far from the truth. More than half of the tales the Grimm brothers collected were contributed by women friends from the upper classes. Set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic wars and the high years of German romanticism, <i>Clever Maids</i> chronicles this most fascinating enterprise in literary history, and illuminates the ways the Grimm tales-with their mythic portrayals of courage, sacrifice, and betrayal-still resonate so powerfully today.",

    "description": "Cultural Writing. Asian American Studies. In his long-overdue first collection of essays, noted journalist and NPR commentator Andrew Lam explores his life-long struggle for identity as a Viet Kieu, or a Vietnamese national living abroad. At age eleven, Lam, the son of a South Vietnamese general, came to California on the eve of the fall of Saigon to communist forces. He traded his Vietnamese name for a more American one and immersed himself in the allure of the American Dream: something not clearly defined for him or his family. Reflecting on the meanings of the Vietnam War to the Vietnamese people themselves--particularly to those in exile--Lam picks with searing honesty at the roots of his doubleness and his parents' longing for a homeland that no longer exists.",

    "description": "After 17 years at sea, Linda Greenlaw decided it was time to take a break from being a swordboat captain, the career that would earn her a prominent role in Sebastian Junger's <em>The Perfect Storm</em> and a portrayal in the subsequent film. Greenlaw decided to move back home, to a tiny island seven miles off the Maine coast. There, she would pursue a simpler life as a lobsterman, find a husband, and settle down. But all doesn't go as planned. The lobsters refuse to crawl out from under their rocks and into the traps she and her father have painstakingly set. Fellow islanders draw her into bizarre intrigues, and the eligible bachelors prove even more elusive than the lobsters. But just when she thinks things can't get worse, something happens that forces her to reevaluate everything she thought she knew about life, luck, and lobsters. Filled with nautical detail and the dramas of small-town life, <em>The Lobster Chronicles</em> is a celebration of family and community. Greenlaw proves once again that fishermen are the best storytellers around.",

    "description": "<b>\n  <i>Why is it that women, who are so competent in all other areas of their lives, cannot find the same competence when it comes to matters of money?<br /></i>\n</b><br /><b>Suze Orman investigates the complicated, dysfunctional relationship women have with money in this groundbreaking new book.</b> With her signature mix of insight, compassion, and soul-deep recognition, she equips women with the financial knowledge and emotional awareness to overcome the blocks that have kept them from making more out of the money they make. At the center of the book is The Save Yourself Plan--a streamlined, five-month program that delivers genuine long-term financial security. But what's at stake is far bigger than money itself: <b>It's about every woman's sense of who she is and what she deserves, and why it all begins with the decision to save yourself. </b><br /><br /><br /><b>Join the Movement to Save Yourself with this Unprecedented Offer to Readers of Women &amp; Money: </b><br /><br />Suze Orman believes that having an account of your own is the cornerstone of long-term financial security, and so she has begun a national movement called <b>Save Yourself </b>to turn this wish--that every woman have an account in her own name--into a reality. She is joined in this crusade by the financial brokerage firm TD Ameritrade, which has come up with an extraordinary offer for readers of WOMEN &amp; MONEY. Follow Suze's <b>Save Yourself Plan </b>and open an account in your name with TD Ameritrade. Commit to an automatic deposit of at least $50 per month for twelve consecutive months, and TD Ameritrade will provide the incentive in the form of a $100 deposit into your account in the thirteenth month. In other words, you save $600 or more over the course of a year, and TD Ameritrade will reward that effort with a $100 bonus. Learn more inside the book or at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.saveyourself.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.saveyourself.com</a>.<br /><br />Offer valid for one new TD AMERITRADE account (non-retirement) opened between 2/27/07 and 3/31/08, and funded by 12 monthly consecutive automatic electronic deposits of $50 or more. First $50 must be deposited within 30 days of opening account. To be eligible, you must be a U.S. resident aged 18 or older.

    "description": "<b> Newly revised and updated, this landmark anthology offers gripping portraits of American life as seen through the eyes of young women of color</b><br /><br />It has been decades since women of color first turned feminism upside down, exposing the feminist movement as exclusive, white, and unaware of the concerns and issues of women of color from around the globe. Since then, key social movements have risen, including Black Lives Matter, transgender rights, and the activism of young undocumented students. Social media has also changed how feminism reaches young women of color, generating connections in all corners of the country. And yet we remain a country divided by race and gender.<br /><br />Now, a new generation of outspoken women of color offer a much-needed fresh dimension to the shape of feminism of the future. In <i>Colonize This!</i>, Daisy Hernandez and Bushra Rehman have collected a diverse, lively group of emerging writers who speak to the strength of community and the influence of color, to borders and divisions, and to the critical issues that need to be addressed to finally reach an era of racial freedom. With prescient and intimate writing, <i>Colonize This! </i>will reach the hearts and minds of readers who care about the experience of being a woman of color, and about establishing a culture that fosters freedom and agency for women of all races.<br />",

    "description": "Herman Wouk is one of this century's great historical novelists, whose peerless talent for capturing the human drama of landmark world events has earned him worldwide acclaim. In 'The Hope', his long-awaited return to historical fiction, he turns to one of the most thrilling stories of our time - the saga of Israel. In the grand, epic style of 'The Winds of War' and 'War and Remembrance', <br /><br />'The Hope' plunges the reader into the major battles, the disasters and victories, and the fragile periods of peace from the 1948 War of Independence to the astounding triumph of the Six-Day War in 1967. And since Israelis have seen their share of comic mishaps as well as heroism, this novel offers some of Herman Wouk's most amusing scenes since the famed \"strawberry business\" in 'The Caine Mutiny'. <br /><br />First to last 'The Hope' is a tale of four Israeli army officers and the women they love: Zev Barak, Viennese-born cultured military man; Benny Luria, ace fighter pilot with religious stirrings; Sam Pasternak, sardonic and mysterious Mossad man; and an antic dashing warrior they call Kishote, Hebrew for Quixote, who arrives at Israel's first pitched battle a refugee boy on a mule and over the years rises to high rank. <br /><br />In the love stories of these four men, the author of 'Marjorie Morningstar' has created a gallery of three memorable Israeli women and one quirky fascinating American, daughter of a high CIA official and headmistress of a Washington girls school. With the authenticity, authority, and narrative force of Wouk's finest fiction, The Hope portrays not so much the victory of one people over another, as the gallantry of the human spirit, surviving and triumphing against crushing odds. In that sense it can be called a tale of hope for all mankind; a note that Herman Wouk has struck in all his writings, against the prevailing pessimism of our turbulent century.",

    "description": "#1 <b>New York Times</b> bestselling author Nora Roberts presents a novel set deep in the bayou of Louisiana\u2014where the only witness to a long-ago tragedy is a once-grand house\u2026\u00a0<br /><br />Declan Fitzgerald had always been the family maverick, but even he couldn't understand his impulse to buy a dilapidated mansion on the outskirts of New Orleans. All he knew was that ever since he first saw Manet Hall, he'd been enchanted-and obsessed-with it. So when the opportunity to buy the house comes up, Declan jumps at the chance to live out a dream.<br /><br />Determined to restore Manet Hall to its former splendor, Declan begins the daunting renovation room by room, relying on his own labor and skills. But the days spent in total isolation in the empty house take a toll. He is seeing visions of days from a century past, and experiencing sensations of terror and nearly unbearable grief-sensations not his own, but those of a stranger. Local legend has it that the house is haunted, and with every passing day Declan's belief in the ghostly presence grows.<br /><br />Only the companionship of alluring Angelina Simone can distract him from the mysterious happenings in the house, but Angelina too has her own surprising connection to Manet Hall-a connection that will help Declan uncover a secret that's been buried for a hundred years.<br />",

    "description": "In the spirit of the bestselling <i>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves</i>, this is an informative and highly amusing little book about bad English, full of examples of the incorrect grammar and usage that often pervades modern radio broadcasts, newspaper articles, classroom discussions, and political speeches. As author James Cochrane explains, he does not take issue with the so-called \"educated or uneducated\" uses of the English language. <i>Between You and I</i> is more concerned with the particular form of English debasement we now have, which might be called the \"half-educated\" uses of language. Readers may be surprised to find that much of what they thought was \"bad\" English is in fact perfectly good and that what they have learned to think of as \"good\" English is sometimes ignorant, dishonest, or just plain stupid.",

Little is known of her but she was probably the Abbess of the abbey at Shaftesbury in the late 12th century, illegitimate daughter of Geoffrey Plantagenet and hence the half-sister of Henry II of England. It was to a king, and probably Henry II, that she dedicated these poems of adventure and love which were retellings of stories which she had heard from Breton minstrels. She is regarded as the most talented French poet of the medieval period.",

    "description": "This stirring, poignant novel, based on real historical events that made of actual people true heroes, unfolds the tragedy that befell the Armenian people in the dark year of 1915. The Great War is raging through Europe, and in the ancient, mountainous lands southwest of the Caspian Sea the Turks have begun systematically to exterminate their Christian subjects. Unable to deny his birthright or his people, one man, Gabriel Bagradian\u2014born an Armenian, educated in Paris, married to a Frenchwoman, and an officer doing his duty as a Turkish subject in the Ottoman army\u2014will strive to resist death at the hands of his blood enemy by leading 5,000 Armenian villagers to the top of Musa Dagh, \"the mountain of Moses.\" There, for forty days, in the face of almost certain death, they will suffer the siege of a Turkish army hell-bent on genocide. A passionate warning against the dangers of racism and scapegoating, and prefiguring the ethnic horrors of World War II, this important novel from the early 1930s remains the only significant treatment, in fiction or nonfiction, of the first genocide in the twentieth century's long series of inhumanities. It also continues to be today what the New York Times deemed it in 1933\u2014\"a true and thrilling novel ... a story which must rouse the emotions of all human beings.\" \"Musa Dagh gives us a lasting sense of participation in a stirring episode of history.... Magnificent.\"\u2014The New York Times Book Review \"A novel full of the breath, the flesh and blood and bone and spirit of life.\"\u2014Saturday Review",

    "description": "Kathy, Ruth and Tommy were pupils at Hailsham - an idyllic establishment situated deep in the English countryside. The children there were tenderly sheltered from the outside world, brought up to believe they were special, and that their personal welfare was crucial. But for what reason were they really there? It is only years later that Kathy, now aged 31, finally allows herself to yield to the pull of memory. What unfolds is the haunting story of how Kathy, Ruth and Tommy, slowly come to face the truth about their seemingly happy childhoods - and about their futures. Never Let Me Go is a uniquely moving novel, charged throughout with a sense of the fragility of our lives.",

    "description": "A failed revolutionary attempt drives the hero of Hudson's novel to seek refuge in the primeval forests of south-western Venezuela. There, in the `green mansion' of the title, Abel encounters the wood-nymph Rima, the last survivor of a mysterious aboriginal race. The love that flowers between them is soon overshadowed by cruelty &amp; sorrow. <br /> One of the acknowledged masters of natural history writing, W. H. Hudson forms an important link between 19th-century Romanticism &amp; the 20th-century ecological movement. First published in 1904 &amp; a best-seller after its reissue a dozen years later, Green Mansions offers readers a poignant meditation on the loss of wilderness, the dream of a return to nature &amp; the bitter reality of the encounter between savage &amp; civilized man.",

Then Lord Peter Wimsey is called in, and he soon discovers there's more to copywriting than meets the eye. A bit of cocaine, a hint of blackmail, and some wanton women can be read between the lines. And then there is the brutal succession of murders -- 5 of them -- each one a fixed fee for advertising a deadly secret.",

    "description": "\"For as long as I can remember, I've had Africa on my mind.\" Award-winning chef Marcus Samuelsson may be best known for his innovative take on Scandinavian cuisine at New York's Restaurant Aquavit, but his story begins thousands of miles away, in Africa. Born in Ethiopia and raised in Sweden by adoptive parents, his life transcends national boundaries, and his individual approach to cuisine is a global yet personal one that draws freely from many ethnic and cultural influences.In <i>The Soul of a New Cuisine</i>, Marcus returns to the land of his birth to explore the continent's rich diversity of cultures and cuisines through recipes and stories from his travels in Africa. Stunning color images by award-winning photographer Gediyon Kifle bring the breadth of the African experience to life, from fishermen at sunset off the coast of Zanzibar to French baguettes loaded onto a bicycle in Senegal.<br /><br />Marcus shares more than 200 enticing recipes, including his own African-inspired creations and traditional dishes from all parts of Africa. You can delight in spicy stews and Barbequed Snapper from West Africa and the familiar Mediterranean flavors of dishes like Moroccan Lemon-Olive Chicken, or make your way east and south for the irresistible taste combinations of dishes such as Curried Trout with Coconut-Chili Sauce from Kenya and Apple-Squash Fritters from South Africa's Cape Malay. Using ingredients that are readily available in American markets, the recipes are doable as well as delicious.<br /><br />Of course, one of the keys to authentic African cooking is the use of spice blends and rubs, which elevate simple cooking techniques to an excitingly varied and intense level. Marcus includes his favorites here, with blends that go from sweet to spicy and feature everything from hot chili peppers and peppermint leaves to sesame seeds and ginger.<br /><br />As he says, Africa is \"a state of mind that I hope this book will help you tap into wherever you are.\" By cooking with a handful of this and a pinch of that, trying new foods and enjoying old ones in a new way, and lingering over meals with family and friends, you will bring the free, relaxed spirit of African cooking to your table and discover for yourself the soul of a \"new\" cuisine.",

    "description": "One of the 20th century's enduring works, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize\u0096winning career.<br /><br /><p>The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buend\u00eda family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buend\u00eda family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America.</p><br /><br /><p>Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.</p><br /><br /><p>Alternately reverential and comical, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.</p>",

They offer an account of a life of almost unbearable intensity.</p>",

Each sought the other\u2019s death as fire and water seek each other\u2019s annihilation. The walled field, at first a prison, now became a crucible where one man would be destroyed and the other purged in the name of justice. They would fight not only without quarter, but also without rules. And a horrible fate awaited the lady if her husband should lose . . . <br /><br />The gripping, atmospheric true story of the \u201cduel to end all duels\u201d in medieval France: a trial by combat pitting a knight against a squire accused of violating the knight\u2019s beautiful young wife<br /><br />In 1386, a few days after Christmas, a huge crowd gathers at a Paris monastery to watch the two men fight a duel to the death meant to \u201cprove\u201d which man\u2019s cause is right in God\u2019s sight. The dramatic true story of the knight, the squire, and the lady unfolds during the devastating Hundred Years War between France and England, as enemy troops pillage the land, madness haunts the French court, the Great Schism splits the Church, Muslim armies threaten Christendom, and rebellion, treachery, and plague turn the lives of all into toys of Fortune.<br />At the heart of the tale is Jean de Carrouges, a Norman knight who returns from combat in Scotland to find his wife, Marguerite, accusing Jacques LeGris, her husband\u2019s old friend and fellow courtier, of brutally raping her. The knight takes his cause before the teenage King Charles VI, the highest judge in France. Amid LeGris\u2019s vociferous claims of innocence and doubts about the now pregnant Marguerite\u2019s charges (and about the paternity of her child), the deadlocked court decrees a \u201ctrial by combat\u201d that leaves her fate, too, in the balance. For if her husband and champion loses the duel, she will be put to death as a false accuser. <br />Carrouges and LeGris, in full armor, eventually meet on a walled field in Paris before a massive crowd that includes the king and many nobles of the realm. A fierce fight on horseback and then on foot ensues during which both combatants suffer wounds\u2014but only one fatal. The violent and tragic episode was notorious in its own time because of the nature of the alleged crime, the legal impasse it provoked, and the resulting trial by combat, an ancient but increasingly suspect institution that was thereafter abolished. <br />Based on extensive research in Normandy and Paris, <i>The Last Duel </i>brings to life a colorful, turbulent age and three unforgettable characters caught in a fatal triangle of crime, scandal, and revenge. It is at once a moving human drama, a captivating detective story, and an engrossing work of historical intrigue.",

Are they dreams? Allegories? Symbols? Countless answers have been offered, but the essential mystery remains intact. Setting out on his own exploration, Roberto Calasso enters the flow, the tortuous movement, the physiology of Kafka\u2019s work to discover why K. and Josef K.\u2013the protagonists of <i>The Castle </i>and <i>The Trial</i>\u2013are so radically different from any other character in the history of the novel, and to determine who, in the end, is K. The culmination of Calasso\u2019s lifelong fascination with Kafka\u2019s work, <i>K. </i>is also an unprecedented consideration of the mystery of Kafka himself.",

    "description": "<b>Sequel To The Hugo Award-Winning Bestseller<i> The Snow Queen</i></b><br /><br /><i>The Summer Queen</i> is the extraordinary sequel to one of science fiction's most celebrated novels, <i>The Snow Queen</i>. Set in a fully realized universe of wonders, this spectacular space epic, itself a finalist for the Hugo Award, is one of the most remarkable novels in the field.<br /><br />A story that spans millennia, from the ruins of an ancient interstellar empire to the planets of the Hegemony that rules human space, <i>The Summer Queen</i> is the multi-layered story of Tiamat, a world where the dolphin-like mers are harvested for the youth-prolonging serum extracted from their blood. But Tiamat is much more, for beneath Carbuncle, its capital, lies the old empire's greatest secret: an enormous forgotten technology which, though decaying, continues to affect the fates of the fallen empire's remnant cultures via the sybil-network--a data bank that binds the past and the future in its web of knowledge, As the Smith, genius mastermind of the hidden interstellar Brotherhood, tries feverishly to unlock its secrets, BZ Gundhalinu desperately strives to save the Hegemony, while the Summer Queen herself dares to create a new future for her people and her planet. And though each is acting alone, their fates will entwine in an astonishing climax that will change the universe forever.",

    "description": "Now in its sixth edition, Modern Latin America is a lively interpretive history and the leading text in the field. Thoroughly updated and revised, the book includes a new chapter on the history of Colombia from the wars of independence to the violent conflicts of the present day. It also examines such topics as: <br /> * the impact of 9/11 on U.S.-Latin American relations <br /> * globalization <br /> * drug trafficking <br /> * women's roles in society and politics <br /> * the fragility and uncertainty of democracy in Latin America <br /> The book features sociocultural sections and boxes in nearly every chapter, covering such diverse areas as the psychology of exile, Santeria in Cuba, baseball in the Dominican Republic, and the popularity of Latin music in the U.S. All political and economic information has been updated. As in earlier editions, the authors use an in-depth case study approach that guides readers through the major countries of Latin America, highlighting central themes including European-New World interaction, racial mixtures, military takeovers, and United States intervention in the area. With an insightful look into the future, Modern Latin America, Sixth Edition, will continue to be an exceptional text for undergraduate courses on contemporary Latin American history, society, and politics.\"",

    "description": "<em>Curry</em> serves up a delectable history of Indian cuisine, ranging from the imperial kitchen of the Mughal invader Babur to the smoky cookhouse of the British Raj.<br /><br />In this fascinating volume, the first authoritative history of Indian food, Lizzie Collingham reveals that almost every well-known Indian dish is the product of a long history of invasion and the fusion of different food traditions. We see how, with the arrival of Portuguese explorers and the Mughal horde, the cooking styles and ingredients of central Asia, Persia, and Europe came to the subcontinent, where over the next four centuries they mixed with traditional Indian food to produce the popular cuisine that we know today. Portuguese spice merchants, for example, introduced vinegar marinades and the British contributed their passion for roast meat. When these new ingredients were mixed with native spices such as cardamom and black pepper, they gave birth to such popular dishes as biryani, jalfrezi, and vindaloo. In fact, vindaloo is an adaptation of the Portuguese dish \"carne de vinho e alhos-\"-the name \"vindaloo\" a garbled pronunciation of \"vinho e alhos\"--and even \"curry\" comes from the Portuguese pronunciation of an Indian word. Finally, Collingham describes how Indian food has spread around the world, from the curry houses of London to the railway stands of Tokyo, where \"karee raisu\" (curry rice) is a favorite Japanese comfort food. We even visit Madras Mahal, the first Kosher Indian restaurant, in Manhattan.<br /><br />Richly spiced with colorful anecdotes and curious historical facts, and attractively designed with 34 illustrations, 5 maps, and numerous recipes, <em>Curry</em> is vivid, entertaining, and delicious--a feast for food lovers everywhere.<br />",

    "description": "This fine, somber novel, by the author of the widely acclaimed <i>The Lost Steps</i>, deals with the French Revolution, chiefly in the Caribbean. Not an ordinary historical novel, but rather a poetic, highly informed essay, it forth, in rich prose, a host of memorable impressions -- of Revolutionary Paris, of Caribbean islands sweltering in the sunlight, and of the Revolutionary ideals which, transplanted to these islands, died in blood, sweat and a return to slavery and the old ways. Its chief protagonist is Victor Hugues, a historical figure, who is shown through the eyes of three fictional orphaned adolescents -- Carlos, Sofia, and their cousin Esteban, whom he dazzled at first meeting. Esteban follows Victor as he rises from baker's son and merchant to Revolutionary master of the Caribbean, but sickens eventually of bloodshed and of Victor's ruthless changing to fit shifting policies. Sofia, who loves Victor and joins him, is also finally sickened by the betrayal of Revolutionary ideals, and the changes power has made in Victor. Above its many modern political parallels, this story is powerful evocation of the mysterious evolution, decay and persistence of all human relations and ambitions. Splendidly written.",

They are tales of human passion in all of its infinite variety: adultery, seduction, incest, rape, mutilation, assassination, torture, sacrifice, and murder. . . .\"<br /><br />Sex. Violence. Scandal. These are words we rarely associate with the sacred text of the Bible. Yet in this brilliant book, Jonathan Kirsch recounts shocking tales that have been suppressed by religious authorities throughout history. Kirsch places each story within the political and social context of its time, delves into the latest biblical scholarship to explain why each one was originally censored, and shows how these ancient narratives hold valuable lessons for all of us.",

She became known worldwide as Lightning Girl--a psychic who could find the location of anyone, dead or alive. Jess finally had no choice but to embrace her newfound talent, and ended up lending her skills to the U.S. government. <br /><br />But her work for them has taken a terrible toll, and Jess resurfaces months later a shadow of her former self, her powers gone, Lightning Girl no more. Her only hope is starting over in a new place, a big city where nobody knows her.<br /><br />It's only when Rob Wilkins unexpectedly shows up on her doorstep that she's forced to face her past. Rob, all the way from back home, needs her help. But how can Jess, her powers gone, find anyone, let alone the sister of a man she once loved . . . when she can't even find herself? <br /><br /><i>Missing You</i>, the fifth and final book in the 1-800-Where-R-You series",

    "description": "<b>Dennis Cooper's sparely crafted novels have earned him an international reputation-even as his subject matter has made him a controversial figure. God Jr. is a stunningly accomplished new novel that marks a new phase in Cooper's noteworthy career.</b><br /><br />God Jr. is the story of Jim, a father who survived the car crash that killed his teenage son Tommy. Tommy was distant, transfixed by video games and pop culture, and a mystery to the man who raised him. Now, disabled by the accident, yearning somehow to absolve his own guilt over the crash, Jim becomes obsessed with a mysterious building Tommy drew repetitively in a notebook before he died. As the fixation grows, Jim starts to take on elements of his son - at the expense of his job and marriage - but is he connecting with who Tommy truly was?<br /><br /><b>A tender, wrenching look at guilt, grief, and the tenuous bonds of family, God Jr. is unlike anything Dennis Cooper has yet written. It is a triumphant achievement from one of our finest writers.</b>",

    "description": "In March 1989 a group of teenage boys lured a retarded girl into a basement in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, and gang-raped her. Glen Ridge was the kind of peaceful, affluent suburb many Americans dream about. The rapists were its most popular high school athletes. And although rumors of the crime quickly spread through the town, weeks passed before anyone saw fit to report it to the police. <br /><br />What made these boys capable of brutalizing a girl that some of them had known since childhood? Why did so many of their elders deny the rape and rally around its perpetrators? To solve this riddle, the Edgar award-winning author Bernard Lefkowitz conducted years of research and more than two hundred interviews. The result is not just a wrenching story of crime and punishment, but a hauntingly nuanced portrait of America's jock culture and the hidden world of unrestrained adolescent sexuality.",

With the ring of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring. As soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring and a fluttering all through the farm buildings. Word had gone round during the day that old Major, the prize Middle White boar, had had a strange dream on the previous night and wished to communicate it to the other animals. It had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as soon as Mr. Jones was safely out of the way. Old Major (so he was always called, though the name under which he had been exhibited was Willingdon Beauty) was so highly regarded on the farm that everyone was quite ready to lose an hour's sleep in order to hear what he had to say.",

He really just likes to liven things up at school -- and he's always had plenty of great ideas. When Nick learns some interesting information about how words are created, suddenly he's got the inspiration for his best plan ever...the frindle. Who says a pen has to be called a pen? Why not call it a frindle? Things begin innocently enough as Nick gets his friends to use the new word. Then other people in town start saying frindle. Soon the school is in an uproar, and Nick has become a local hero. His teacher wants Nick to put an end to all this nonsense, but the funny thing is frindle doesn't belong to Nick anymore. The new word is spreading across the country, and there's nothing Nick can do to stop it.",

    "description": "Nobel Prize-winning author Abel Znorko lives as a recluse on a remote island in the Norwegian Seas. For fifteen years, his one friend and soulmate has been Helen, from whom he has been physically separated for the majority of their affair. Journalist Erik Larsen arrives to interview Znorko about his latest book, which is, in fact, a transcript of correspondence between the author and Helen. As Larsen seeks to unmask the identity of Helen, Znorko becomes infuriated. Evasions and lies twist into increasingly complex puzzles. Is Larsen really a journalist? Is it possible that both Znorko and Larsen love the same woman? Is Helen still alive? Slowly the barriers between the two men begin to fall as the profound mysteries of intimacy rise in their place.",

    "description": "How we know that a cat is a cat is a nice philosophical poser, and has been since the time of Plato. Why we should all agree on calling the animal a cat is equally interesting, yet it throws up the problem that lies at the heart of all modern philosophy: how much do our perceptions of things depend on our cognitive ability, and how much on our linguistic resources?<br /><br />Where, and how, do these two questions meet? Having decided against a systematic treatment of his subject, Umberto Eco undertakes a series of idiosyncratic and typically brilliant explorations, starting from the perceived data of common sense, from which flow an abundance of 'stories' or fables, often with animals as protagonists, to expound a clear critique of Kant, Heidegger and Peirce. And, as a beast designed specifically to throw spanners in the works of cognitive theory, the duckbilled platypus naturally takes centre stage.",

    "description": "For almost ten years, Samuel Mockbee, a recent MacArthur Grant recipient, and his architecture students at Auburn University have been designing and building striking houses and community buildings for impoverished residents of Alabama's Hale County. Using salvaged lumber and bricks, discarded tires, hay and waste cardboard bales, concrete rubble, colored bottles, and old license plates, they create inexpensive buildings that bear the trademark of Mockbee's work, which he describes as \"contemporary modernism grounded in Southern culture.\"In a time of unexampled prosperity, when architectural attention focuses on big, glossy urban projects, the Rural Studio provides an alternative of substance. In addition to being a social welfare venture, the Rural Studio--\"Taliesin South\" as Mockbee calls it--is also an educational experiment and a prod to the architectural profession to act on its best instincts. In giving students hands-on experience in designing and building something real, it extends their education beyond paper architecture. And in scavenging and reusing a variety of unusual materials, it is a model of sustainable architecture. The work of Rural Studio has struck such a chord-both architecturally and socially--that it has been featured on Oprah, Nightline, and CBS News, as well as in Time and People magazines.The Studio has completed more than a dozen projects, including the Bryant \"Hay Bale\" House, Harris \"Butterfly\" House, Yancey Chapel, Akron Chapel, Children's Center, H.E.R.O. Playground, Lewis House, Super Sheds and Pods, Spencer House addition, Farmer's Market, Mason's Bend Community Center, Goat House, and Shannon-Dutley House. These buildings, along with the incredible story of the Rural Studio, the people who live there, and Mockbee and his student architects, are detailed in this colorful book, the first on the subject.\"I tell my students, it's got to be warm, dry, and noble\"--Samuel Mockbee",

Not surprisingly, a pregnant woman\u00eds chances of giving birth to a healthy infant are dramatically improved when she's on an excellent diet. From the authors of the bestselling <i>What to Expect When You\u00edre Expecting</i> and <i>What to Expect the First Year</i>, together with over 15 million copies in print, here is the definitive guide to nourishing both the unborn child and the mother-to-be.<br /><br /><i>What to East When You're Expecting</i> suggests a \"Daily Dozen\" diet comprised of wholesome unprocessed foods. Allowing for a weight gain of 20 to 30 pounds, its easy-to-follow plan uses a simple system to monitor servings from 12 food groups that promote fetal development and maternal well-being.<br /><br />In addition to 100 recipes, the book suggests the best foods to eat at home, in restaurants, even at the office or when traveling. It is sympathetic to the modern woman\u00eds particular concerns and time pressures, and offers special counsel to vegetarians, special warnings to those who drink, smoke, or fast, and special encouragement to all who plan to breastfeed. Over 823,000 copies in print.",

    "description": "Maurice Sendak calls Eloise a \"brazen, loose-limbed little monster.\" Pulitzer Prize winner Anna Quindlen finds her pathetic and lonely. Eloise gave <i>Vanity Fair</i> writer Marie Brenner \"permission to rebel.\" Anyone who has been introduced to the eccentric 6-year-old who spends her days at large in New York's Plaza Hotel pouring water down the mail chute and managing her self-imposed responsibilities is fascinated, fascinated, fascinated. She is the only girl we know who feeds her turtle raisins and braids his ears, wears Kleenex boxes on her head (they make very good hats), and gets away with everything. Even if you have seven copies of the original <i>Eloise</i>, you may want to add <i>The Absolutely Essential Eloise</i> to your collection. In addition to the full splendor of the original 65-page <i>Eloise</i> story, this special edition includes an 18-page scrapbook, written by Marie Brenner, with \"photographs of Miss Kay Thompson when she was young and fabulous and <i>rawther</i> like Eloise\" and never-before-seen photographs, memorabilia, and sketches and stories from illustrator Hilary Knight. Anyone who adores Eloise and is intrigued by her talented creators should have this book within easy reach. (Click to see a sample spread. Copyright 1955, renewed 1983 by Kay Thompson. Scrapbook text copyright 1999 by Marie Brenner. Used with permission of Simon &amp; Schuster Books for Young Readers.) (Ages 5 to 105) <i>--Karin Snelson</i>",

    "description": "Breathtaking and mesmerizing, <em>Colditz</em> is a gripping tale of perseverance, heroism, and adventure. Filled with the thrilling never-before-told personal stories of the prisoners of war held within the walls of this medieval fortress turned German high-security prison camp, <em>Colditz</em> offers endlessly intriguing stories of consummate survivors who proved the human spirit to be indomitable.<br /><br />In more than fifty original interviews, the English, French, Dutch, and Polish officers and their guards describe their experiences in the notorious castle. They reveal their boredom and frustrations, as well as the challenges inherent in making maps out of jelly or constructing tunnels with mere cutlery knives. The stories are by turns comic and tragic, as much of their labor and invention ended in failure. But what emerges is a story of breathtaking ingenuity and an intriguing portrait of the fascinating game of wits between captives and captors, who were bound together by mutual respect and extraordinary tolerance.",

    "description": "For the Trigianis, cooking has always been a family affair\u2013and the kitchen was the bustling center of their home, where folks gathered around the table for good food, good conversation, and the occasional eruption. Example: Being thrown out of the kitchen because one\u2019s Easter bread kneading technique isn\u2019t up to par. As Adriana says: \u201cWhen the Trigianis reach out and touch someone, we do it with food.\u201d Like the recipes that have been handed down for generations from mother to daughter and grandmother to granddaughter, the family\u2019s celebrations are also anchored to the life and laughter around the table. We learn how Grandmom Yolanda Trigiani sometimes wrote her recipes in code, or worked from memory, guarding her recipes carefully. And we meet Grandma Lucia Bonicelli, who never raised her voice and believed that when people fight at the dinner table, the food turns to poison in the body.<br /><br />Adriana Trigiani\u2019s voice springs to life from the first page of <b>Cooking with My Sisters</b>, a collection of beloved family recipes that the Trigianis have been enjoying for generations. But there\u2019s much more here than just the food. Peppered with hilarious family anecdotes, poignant letters, and exquisite color photographs, <b>Cooking with My Sisters</b> draws us into the warm and witty world of the Trigiani clan. Each recipe has a story behind it, and each chapter has tips from different sisters, reflecting the unique personalities of the latest generation of Trigiani women.<br /><br />Here are mainstay meals, featured in sections such as \u201cThe Big Life\u201d and \u201cThe Big Wow,\u201d which include the chapters \u201cPasta, or as We Called It, <i>Maccheroni</i>\u201d and \u201cFood We Hated as Kids but Love to Serve Now.\u201d Accessible to any cook, the recipes range from Chicken and Polenta, Zizi Mary\u2019s Rice Soup, and Gnocchi to favorite desserts like Grandmom\u2019s Buttermilk Cake\u2013and all the delectable dishes are geared toward bringing your family together.<br /><br />Written with Adriana Trigiani\u2019s trademark humor and verve, this wonderful book will appeal to anyone who values the bonds that food, community, and cultural tradition can provide.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "Since Barbie's introduction in 1959, her impact on baby boomers has been revolutionary. Far from being a toy designed by men to enslave women, she was a toy invented by women to teach women what-- for better or worse-- was expected of them. In telling Barbie's fascinating story, cultural critic and investigative journalist M. G. Lord, herself a first-generation Barbie owner, has written a provocative, zany, occasionally shocking book that will change how you look at the doll and the world.",

    "description": "<b>The second novel by Ayn Rand, acclaimed author of <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> and <i>The Fountainhead</i>, envisions a future dystopia where free thought is a crime against the great \u201cwe.\u201d</b><br /><br />He lived in the dark ages of the future. In a loveless world he dared to love the woman of his choice. In an age that had lost all trace of science and civilization he had the courage to seek and find knowledge. But these were not the crimes for which he would be hunted. He was marked for death because he had committed the unpardonable sin: He had stood forth from the mindless human herd. In a world that deprives individuals of name, independence, and values\u2014he was a man alone.<br />\u00a0<br />This edition features an introduction by Rand\u2019s literary executor, Leonard Peikoff, which includes excerpts from documents by Ayn Rand\u2014letters, interviews, and journal notes in which she discusses <i>Anthem</i>.",

    "description": "When Brian McLaren began offering an alternative vision of Christian faith and life in books such as <i>A New Kind of Christian</i> and <i>A Generous Orthodoxy,</i> he ignited a firestorm of praise and condemnation that continues to spread across the religious landscape. To some religious conservatives, McLaren is a dangerous rebel without a doctrinally-correct cause. Some fundamentalist websites have even claimed he's in league with the devil and have consigned him to flames.<br /><br />To others though, Brian is a fresh voice, a welcome antidote to the staleness, superficiality, and negativity of the religious status quo. A wide array of people from Evangelical, Catholic, and Mainline Protestant backgrounds claim that through his books they have begun to rediscover the faith they'd lost or rejected. And around the world, many readers say that he has helped them find-for the first time in their lives-a faith that makes sense and rings true. For many, he articulates the promise of what is being called \"emerging Christianity.\"<br /><br />In <i>The Secret Message of Jesus</i> you'll find what's at the center of Brian's critique of conventional Christianity, and what's at the heart of his expanding vision. In the process, you'll meet a Jesus who may be altogether new to you, a Jesus who is\u2026<br /><br /><br />Not the crusading conqueror of religious broadcasting;<br />Not the religious mascot of partisan religion;<br />Not heaven's ticket-checker, whose words have been commandeered by the church to include and exclude, judge and stigmatize, pacify and domesticate.<br />McLaren invites you to discover afresh the transforming message of Jesus-an open invitation to radical change, an enlightening revelation that exposes sham and ignites hope, an epic story that is good news for everyone, whatever their gender, race, class, politics, or religion.<br /><br />\u00a0\"Pastor and best-selling author McLaren revisits the gospel material from a fresh-and at times radical-perspective . . . He does an excellent job of capturing Jesus' quiet, revolutionary style.\"<br /><br />--<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br /><br />\"Here McLaren shares his own ferocious journey in pondering the teachings and actions of Jesus. It is McLaren's lack of salesmanship or agenda that creates a refreshing picture of the man from Galilee who changed history.\"<br /><br />--Donald Miller, Author of <i>Blue Like Jazz</i><br /><br />\"In this critical book, Brian challenges us to ask what it would mean to truly live the message of Jesus today, and thus to risk turning everything upside down.\"<br /><br />--Jim Wallis, Author of <i>God's Politics</i> and editor of <i>Sojourners</i><br /><br />\"Compelling, crucial and liberating: a book for those who seek to experience the blessed heat of Christianity at its source.\"<br /><br />--Anne Rice, Author of <i>Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt</i>",

    "description": "By the mid-1930s Laura Ingalls Wilder's journeys had taken her from Wisconsin to South Dakota, from Missouri to California and back again. She had traveled by wagon, by train, and by car; alone, with her husband, and with her daughter. She had watched the times, seasons, and people change over six decades of traveling. But one thing remained the same: Laura always kept a pencil and paper with her to jot down notes about her experiences.<br /><br />For the first time ever, writings from three of Laura's most memorable trips have been collected in one special omnibus edition featuring historical black-and-white photographs. <em>On the Way Home</em> recounts her 1894 move with Rose and Almanzo from South Dakota to their new homestead in Mansfield, Missouri. <em>West From Home</em> consists of letters from Laura to Almanzo as she traveled to California in 1915 to visit Rose. And previously unpublished materials from Laura and Almanzo's car trip in 1931 now tell the story of their first journey back to DeSmet, the town where Laura grew up, where she met Almanzo, and where they fell in love. Laura's candid sense of humor and keen eye for observation shine through in this wonderful collection of writings about the many places Laura Ingalls Wilder called home.",

    "description": "<i>Through the Arc of the Rain Forest</i> is a burlesque of comic-strip adventures and apocalyptic portents that stretches familiar truths to their logical extreme in a future world that is just recognizable enough to be frightening. In the Author's Note,\" Karen Tei Yamashita writes that her book is like a Brazilian soap opera called a novela: \"the novela's story is completely changeable according to the whims of the public psyche and approval, although most likely, the unhappy find happiness; the bad are punished; true love reigns; a popular actor is saved from death ... an idyll striking innocence, boundless nostalgia and terrible ruthlessness.\" The stage is a vast, mysterious field of impenetrable plastic in the Brazilian rain forest set against a backdrop of rampant environmental destruction, commercialization, poverty, and religious rapture. <i>Through the Arc of the Rainforest</i> is narrated by a small satellite hovering permanently around the head of an innocent character named Kazumasa. Through no fault of his own, Kazumasa seems to draw strange and significant people into his orbit and to find himself at the center of cataclysmic events that involve carrier pigeons, religious pilgrims, industrial espionage, magic feathers, big money, miracles, epidemics, true love, and the virtual end of the world. This book is simultaneously entertaining and depressing, with all the rollicking pessimism you'd expect of a good soap opera or a good political satire.\"- Kirsten Backstrom, <i>500 Great Books by Women</i>",

    "description": "<b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Elizabeth I</i> reveals the untold story of Mary Magdalene--a disciple of Jesus Christ and the most mysterious woman in the Bible.<br /></b><br />Was Mary Magdalene a prostitute, a female divinity figure, a church leader, or all of those? Biblical references to her are tantalizingly brief, but we do know that she was the first person to whom the risen Christ appeared--and the one commissioned to tell others the good news, earning her the ancient honorific, \"Apostle to the Apostles.\"<br /><br />Today, Mary continues to spark controversy, curiosity, and veneration. In a vivid re-creation of Mary Magdalene's life story, Margaret George convincingly captures this renowned woman's voice as she moves from girlhood to womanhood, becomes part of the circle of disciples, and comes to grips with the divine.<br /><br />While grounded in biblical scholarship and secular research, <i>Mary, Called Magdalene </i>ultimately transcends both history and fiction to become a \"diary of a soul.\"",

    "description": "One of our most brilliant evolutionary biologists, <b>Richard Lewontin</b> has also been a leading critic of those--scientists and non-scientists alike--who would misuse the science to which he has contributed so much. In <i>The Triple Helix</i>, Lewontin the scientist and Lewontin the critic come together to provide a concise, accessible account of what his work has taught him about biology and about its relevance to human affairs. In the process, he exposes some of the common and troubling misconceptions that misdirect and stall our understanding of biology and evolution. The central message of this book is that we will never fully understand living things if we continue to think of genes, organisms, and environments as separate entities, each with its distinct role to play in the history and operation of organic processes. Here Lewontin shows that an organism is a unique consequence of both genes and environment, of both internal and external features. Rejecting the notion that genes determine the organism, which then adapts to the environment, he explains that organisms, influenced in their development by their circumstances, in turn create, modify, and choose the environment in which they live. <i>The Triple Helix</i> is vintage Lewontin: brilliant, eloquent, passionate, and deeply critical. But it is neither a manifesto for a radical new methodology nor a brief for a new theory. It is instead a primer on the complexity of biological processes, a reminder to all of us that living things are never as simple as they may seem.",

    "description": "The flame-haired virago bearing down on Ross MacKenna was far too shapely to be a seasoned warrior, but she was just as deadly. As she engaged him on the battlefield, Ross knew her for a MacKay, long-time enemies of his clan. What he didn't know was that she would soon be his wife, given to him by her father in a desperate effort to end generations of feuding. The only problem was that of all her family, Gillian MacKay was the least willing to make peace. Whether in bed or out, her fiery temper challenged his mastery while her lush body taunted his masculinity. Both politics and pride demanded that he tame her, but would do it in his way -- with a scorching seduction that would sweep away her defenses and win her heart.",

For the next 90 minutes, Piper experiences heaven where he is greeted by those who had influenced him spiritually. He hears beautiful music and feels true peace. <br />Back on earth, a passing minister who had also been at the conference is led to pray for Don even though he knows the man is dead. Piper miraculously comes back to life and the bliss of heaven is replaced by a long and painful recovery. <br />For years Piper kept his heavenly experience to himself. Finally, however, friends and family convinced him to share his remarkable story.",

    "description": "One of the greatest and most ambitious works in English literature, in the original Middle English<br /><br /><em>The Canterbury Tales</em> depicts a storytelling competition between pilgrims drawn from all ranks of society. The tales are as various as the pilgrims themselves, encompassing comedy, pathos, tragedy, and cynicism. The Miller and the Reeve express their mutual antagonism in a pair of comic stories combining sex and trickery; in \u201cThe Shipman\u2019s Tale,\u201d a wife sells her favors to a monk. Others draw on courtly romance and fantasy: the Knight tells of rivals competing for the love of the same woman, and the Squire describes a princess who can speak to birds. In these twenty-four tales, Chaucer displays a dazzling range of literary styles and conjures up a wonderfully vivid picture of medieval life. <br /><br />This is a freshly established Middle English text with standardized spelling and punctuation and on-page glossing. It Features an introduction by Jill Mann, a chronology of Chaucer\u2019s life and works, detailed explanatory notes, suggestions for further reading, a full glossary, and a bibliography.",

The mansion has nearly one hundred rooms, and her uncle keeps himself locked up. And at night, she hears the sound of crying down one of the long corridors.<br /><br />The gardens surrounding the large property are Mary's only escape. Then, Mary discovers a secret garden, surrounded by walls and locked with a missing key. One day, with the help of two unexpected companions, she discovers a way in. Is everything in the garden dead, or can Mary bring it back to life?",

    "description": "A glamorous fish-out-of-water first novel, <i>Paris Hangover</i> stars Klein, a just-escaped New Yorker with trunk-fulls of fabulous footwear but without the significant relationship she'd really expected and longed to have by now, in her mid-thirties. Fleeing a live-in lover and their sleek Tribeca triplex as well as a career in fashion, Klein stars over in Paris-in a tiny walk-up in the 6th that she had to lie (in broken Franglais) and write a bad check to get, only to discover that, among other things, Parisian apartments don't come with kitchens. <br />Living out of her ten piece of (Louis Vuitton, natch) luggage, Klein plunges into the mysterious world of French men and dating. She muddles her way through: the sexy Renaud, the prototypical Frenchman; dating three men named Jean simultaneously; and one completely wrong Monsieur Married Man, who wants Klein for his very well-kept mistress.<br />Set against a backdrop of knowing references to Paris and its unique manners and mores, <i>Paris Hangover</i> is ultimately a very satisfying modern romance as Klein falls-- possibly permanently--for the least likely man to catch her eye.",

    "description": "Never before has a more revealing X ray been taken of the modern American presidential campaign than this compelling memoir of the nation's foremost political operatives, Democrat James Carville and Republican Mary Matalin. <br /> Not since Theodore White's legendary Making of the President series has a book on presidential campaigns so intimately recounted the power plays and clandestine maneuvers that are at the heart of American political dueling. James Cherville and Mary Matalin, themselves the key players at the center of the political battles and election headlines that gripped America, tell in candid, stunning detail of the day-by-day pressures, near disasters, and triumphs of campaign life; they take the reader deeper than ever before into the art of getting a president elected. <br /> For anyone interested in politics and the way our nation chooses its leaders, <i>All's Fair</i> is a vital resource, and the most telling guide available to the inner workings of today's partisan conflict.",

    "description": "This classic of world spiritual literature is the firsthand account of a pilgrim's journey as he endeavors to live out Saint Paul's instruction to \"pray without ceasing.\" The narrator, an unnamed nineteenth-century peasant, sets out on his pilgrimage with nothing but a Bible, a rosary, and some dried bread. As he walks, he recites the Jesus prayer (\"Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me\")--a prayer that is said to quiet anxiety and fill the heart with love for all creation. With this prayer constantly on his lips, the pilgrim undergoes a profound spiritual education. This edition includes the sequel to <i>The Way of a Pilgrim, </i> entitled <i>A Pilgrim Continues His Way, </i> which contains a lengthy appendix reviewing the teachings of the Holy Fathers on the Jesus prayer.",

    "description": "\"Will empower all women to stop believing that our bodies are the problems, dieting the solution.\"<br /><br />--Harriet Lerner, Ph.D.<br /><br /> Author of The Dance of Anger<br /><br /><br /><br />In this revolutionary new book, bestselling authors Carol Munter and Jane Hirschmann explore the myriad reasons why women cling to diets despite overwhelming evidence that diets don't work. In fact, diets turn us into compulsive eaters who are obsessed with food and weight.<br /><br /><br /><br />Munter and Hirschmann call this syndrome \"Bad Body Fever\" and demonstrate how \"bad body thoughts\" are clues to our emotional lives. They explore the difficulties women encounter replacing dieting with demand feeding. And finally, they teach us how to think about our problems rather than eat about them--so that food can resume its proper place in our lives.<br /><br /><br /><br />\"Many women will find in these pages exactly what they need: determined, optimistic, and resourceful coaches, pausing at the right moments to acknowledge the difficulty of change, then passionately urging them to press on.\"<br /><br />--Susan C. Wooley, Ph.D.<br /><br /> Professor of Psychology<br /><br /> Codirector, Eating Disorders Center<br /><br /> University of Cincinnati Medical Center",

In recounting his patients' dilemmas, Yalom not only gives us a rare and enthralling glimpse into their personal desires and motivations but also tells us his own story as he struggles to reconcile his all-too human responses with his sensibility as a psychiatrist. Not since Freud has an author done so much to clarify what goes on between a psychotherapist and a patient.",

    "description": "Laura comes from a world similar to our own except for one <br />difference: it is next to the Place, an unfathomable land that <br />fosters dreams of every kind and is inaccessible to all but a <br />select few, the Dreamhunters. These are individuals with special <br />gifts: the ability to catch larger-than-life dreams and relay them <br />to audiences in the magnificent dream palace, the Rainbow <br />Opera. People travel from all around to experience the benefits<br /> of the hunters' unique visions. Now fifteen-year-old Laura and<br /> her cousin Rose, daughters of Dreamhunters, are eligible to test<br /> themselves at the Place and find out whether they qualify for<br /> the passage. But nothing can prepare them for what they are<br /> about to discover. For within the Place lies a horrific secret kept <br />hidden by corrupt members of the government. And when<br /> Laura's father, the man who discovered the Place, disappears, <br /> she realizes that this secret has the power to destroy everyone<br /> she loves . . . In the midst of a fascinating landscape, Laura's dreamy <br />childhood is ending and a nightmare beginning. This rich <br />novel, filled with beauty, danger, politics, and intrigue, comes to <br />a powerful crescendo, leaving readers clamoring for Book Two. <br />",

Featuring new introductions by Ono and Wenner, and containing substantial material never before seen in print, <i>Lennon Remembers</i> presents a compelling portrait of a complex musical genius at the height of his career. Sometimes anguished and angry, often tender and poignant, these interviews are indispensable to understanding who John Lennon was and why his legacy continues to resonate today.",

He considers himself handicapped because one arm and leg are shorter than the other (by less than half an inch), his mother is trying to poison him with non-organic foods (like salami), he doesn\u2019t have a father, and Sarah Kervick, the new girl, who\u2019s mean and totally unhygienic, is attached to him, warts and all, like glue. <br /><br />This is a hilarious and touching novel featuring a neurotic, scared boy and a tougher-than-nails girl who each help the other in more ways than they can imagine. Sue Stauffacher has crafted characters full of wit and sensitivity, with a little anti-bacterial soap thrown in for good measure.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "Begun as the United States moved its armed forces into Iraq, Rashid Khalidi's powerful and thoughtful new book examines the record of Western involvement in the region and analyzes the likely outcome of our most recent Middle East incursions. Drawing on his encyclopedic knowledge of the political and cultural history of the entire region as well as interviews and documents, Khalidi paints a chilling scenario of our present situation and yet offers a tangible alternative that can help us find the path to peace rather than Empire.<br /><br />We all know that those who refuse to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Sadly, as Khalidi reveals with clarity and surety, America's leaders seem blindly committed to an ahistorical path of conflict, occupation, and colonial rule. Our current policies ignore rather than incorporate the lessons of experience. American troops in Iraq have seen first hand the consequences of U.S. led \"democratization\" in the region. The Israeli/Palestinian conflict seems intractable, and U.S. efforts in recent years have only inflamed the situation. The footprints America follows have led us into the same quagmire that swallowed our European forerunners. Peace and prosperity for the region are nowhere in sight.<br /><br />This cogent and highly accessible book provides the historical and cultural perspective so vital to understanding our present situation and to finding and pursuing a more effective and just foreign policy.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "Now in paperback, War Without Mercy has been hailed by the New York Times as \"one of the most original and important books to be written about the war between Japan and the United States.\" In this monumental history, Professor John Dower reveals a hidden, explosive dimension of the Pacific War -- race -- while writing what John Toland has called \"a landmark book...a powerful, moving, and even-handed history that is sorely needed in both America and Japan.\"<br /><br />Drawing on American and Japanese songs, slogans, cartoons, propaganda films, secret reports, and a wealth of other documents of the time, Dower opens up a whole new way of looking at that bitter struggle of four and a half decades ago and its ramifications in our lives today. As Edwin O. Reischauer, former ambassador to Japan, has pointed out, this book offers \"a lesson that the postwar generations need most...with eloquence, crushing detail, and power.\"",

    "description": "New York Times bestselling author Walter Mosley's novel about two boys, one ensconced in a life of privilege and the other in a life of hardship, explores the true meaning of fortune.In spite of remarkable differences, Eric and Tommy are as close as brothers. Eric, a Nordic Adonis, is graced by a seemingly endless supply of good fortune. Tommy is a lame black boy, cursed with health problems, yet he remains optimistic and strong.After tragedy rips their makeshift family apart, the lives of these boys diverge astonishingly: Eric, the golden youth, is given everything but trusts nothing; Tommy, motherless and impoverished, has nothing, but feels lucky every day of his life. In a riveting story of modern-day resilience and redemption, the two confront separate challenges, and when circumstances reunite them years later, they draw on their extraordinary natures to confront a common enemy and, ultimately, save their lives.",

    "description": "<b>The classic Existentialist novel.</b><br /><br />Winner of the 1964 Nobel Prize for Literature, Jean-Paul Sartre, French philosopher, critic, novelist, and dramatist, holds a position of singular eminence in the world of letters. Among readers and critics familiar with the whole of Sartre's work, it is generally recognized that his earliest novel, <i>La Naus\u00e9e</i> (first published in 1938), is his finest and most significant. It is unquestionably a key novel of the twentieth century and a landmark in Existentialist fiction.<br /><br /><i>Nausea</i> is the story of Antoine Roquentin, a French writer who is horrified at his own existence. In impressionistic, diary form he ruthlessly catalogues his every feeling and sensation. His thoughts culminate in a pervasive, overpowering feeling of nausea which \"spreads at the bottom of the viscous puddle, at the bottom of our time -- the time of purple suspenders and broken chair seats; it is made of wide, soft instants, spreading at the edge, like an oil stain.\" Roquentin's efforts to come to terms with life, his philosophical and psychological struggles, give Sartre the opportunity to dramatize the tenets of his Existentialist creed.",

    "description": "John Steinbeck was never content to repeat himself, and his restless search for new forms and fresh subject matter is fully evident in the books of his later years. This volume collects four novels that exhibit the full range of his gift, along with a travel book that has become one of his most enduringly popular works.<br /><br />In <em>The Wayward Bus</em> (1947), Steinbeck leads a group of ill-matched passengers representing a spectrum of social types and classes, stranded by a washed-out bridge, on a circuitous journey that exposes cruelties, self-deceptions, and unsuspected moral strengths. The tone ranges from boisterous comedy to trenchant satirical observation of postwar America. <em>Burning Bright</em> (1950), an allegory set against shifting backgrounds (circus, sea, farm) and revolving around the fear of sterility and the desire for self-perpetuation, marks Steinbeck\u2019s involvement with the drama in its fusion of the forms of novel and play.<br /><br /><em>Sweet Thursday</em> (1954) marks Steinbeck\u2019s return, in a mood of sometimes frothy comedy, to the characters and milieu of his earlier <em>Cannery Row</em>. A love story set against the background of the local brothel, the Bear Flag, <em>Sweet Thursday</em> is for all its intimations of melancholy one of the most lighthearted of Steinbeck\u2019s books. It was subsequently adapted by Rodgers and Hammerstein into their musical <em>Pipe Dream</em>. Steinbeck\u2019s final novel, <em>The Winter of Our Discontent</em> (1961) is set in an old Long Island whaling town modeled on Sag Harbor, where he had been spending time since 1953. The book breaks new ground in its depiction of the crass commercialism of contemporary America, and its impact on a protagonist with traditionalist values who is appalled but finally tempted by the encroaching sleaziness.<br /><br /><em>Travels with Charley in Search of America</em> (1962) was Steinbeck\u2019s last published book. A record of his experiences and observations as he drove around America in a pickup truck, accompanied by his standard poodle Charley, it is filled with engaging, often humorous description and comes to a powerful climax in an encounter with racist demonstrators in New Orleans.",

          "description": "The Johnny Dixon series began in 1983 with the publication of John Bellairs\u2019 The Curse of the Blue Figurine. Similar to his Lewis Barnavelt series from the previous decade, the Dixon series introduced readers to a timid, young hero who has been forcibly moved from his comfort zone into a new environment; the difference here is that Johnny\u2019s mother is dead of cancer and his father is overseas in the Korean War. The two series are also alike in that they each have supernatural overtones, unlike the initial outing in the Anthony Monday series. \n    \n    Bellairs spent a majority of his writing career documenting the adventures of Johnny and his elderly friend, Professor Roderick Childermass, churning out eight novels in a seven year period, including The Mummy, the Will, and the Crypt; The Spell of the Sorcerer\u2019s Skull; and the time-traveling jaunt, The Trolley to Yesterday. The series expanded in its subsequent years to include a stalwart secondary cast of Byron \u201cFergie\u201d Ferguson, Professor Charles Coote, Sarah Channing, and Father Thomas Higgins, through which Bellairs injected a number of Catholic rites and remembrances into the novels.\n    \n    In 1994, Brad Strickland completed The Drum, the Doll, and the Zombie - as well as three Lewis Barnavelt novels - from notes Bellairs had compiled prior to his death. Due to the popularity of the four manuscripts Strickland had completed, he undertook the formidable task of composing new adventures in the Lewis Barnavelt and Johnny Dixon series. The Hand of the Necromancer (1996), the first novel in the entire Bellairs corpus written entirely by Strickland, proved successful enough to warrant two additional books before the 12-book series went on hiatus in 1999. Following the 2005 settlement of the Bellairs estate, Strickland agreed to compose new adventures, though time will tell if Johnny Dixon returns.",

    "description": "In Stay Fit and Healthy Until You're Dead, Dave Barry says that fitness and vitality can be yours-- provided you have the discipline, drive, and the plain old-fashioned guts required to procure the necessary steroids. This manual may help, too, but you'll just have to buy it and find out.<br /><br />Barry on executive fitness<br />Today's top executives eat teeny meals and run 10 miles and play tennis and work out every day. Of course, they're so busy getting fit that many don't even know where their offices are. That's why the entire U.S. economy is now manufactured overseas.<br /><br />Barry on fitness after death<br />A quick chill, to approximately 325 degrees below zero, yields a muscle tone that we normally associate only with world-class body builders and certain minerals!<br /><br />Barry on nutrition<br />Every morning you should take a vitamin A pill, followed by a vitamin D, followed by an E, until you've spelled the healthful mnemonic phrase: \"A DEAD CAD BAKED A BAD CAKE, ACE.\" And eat all the fiber-rich foods you can shove down your throat; these would be mainly your cotton candy and your Slim Jims.<br /><br />Barry on junk foods<br />White bread and refined sugar, if eaten, cause death within hours. So it's important to watch what you eat, at least until you get it inside your mouth. After that it becomes pretty disgusting.",

    "description": "No book can guarantee you a long and happy relationship, even if the author didn't know about your secret hygiene problem. But the cover of a book is no place to discuss that. In <i>Dave Barry's Guide to Marriage and/or Sex</i>, one of America's most beloved writers turns his keen, if somewhat rheumy, eye to the institution of marriage.<br /><br />Dating. \"These are nonstereotypical times we live in, by which I mean that it is the responsibility of the woman to think up excuses that get progressively more obvious until the man figures out that the woman would rather chew on a rat pancreas.\"<br /><br />Sex. \"I'm afraid that we must talk here about sex in a very explicit manner, because we want to expand the Frontiers of Human Understanding, and also we want to sell as many books as possible to adolescent boys.\"<br /><br />Marriage. \"Most squabbles start with money. For example, you want to buy food, while your spouse wants to buy a thoroughbred racehorse. It's important, in these situations, for both of you to be willing to sit down and try to achieve a workable compromise. In this case, you could buy a thoroughbred racehorse and eat it.\"",

However, what lies beneath the surface of their marriage is far more sinister and their influence leads John into a tragic drama that threatens to destroy everything he cares about.<br /><br />Ford Madox Ford wrote <i>The Good Soldier</i>, the book on which his reputation most surely rests, in deliberate emulation of the nineteenth-century French novels he so admired. In this way he was able to explore the theme of sexual betrayal and its poisonous after-effects with a psychological intimacy as yet unknown in the English novel.<br /><br />(Book Jacket Status: Not Jacketed)",

    "description": "Traces the extraordinary resonance a single choice, even a single word, can have over the course of a lifetime. Seen through the eyes of young Linda Fallon and the young man who loves her.<br /><br />Anita Shreve, the bestselling author of The Pilot's Wife, returns with a dazzling new novel about love, forgiveness, and paths not followed. <br /><br />Linda Fallon encounters her former lover, Thomas Janes, at a literary festival where both have been invited to give readings from their work. It has been years since their paths crossed, and in that time Thomas has become a kind of literary legend. His renown is enhanced by his elusiveness; for most of the past decade, he has remained in seclusion following a devastating loss. <br /><br />This is no chance meeting. Thomas learned that Linda was reading at the festival and chose this moment to reestablish contact with a woman he passionately pursued years earlier. Their affair was disastrous, and a turning point in both their lives. Neither the intensity of their relationship nor the damage it did has ever been far from his memory. From the moment they speak, The Last Time They Met unfolds the story of Linda and Thomas in an extraordinary way: it travels back into their past, bypassing layers of memory and interpretation to present their earlier encounters with unshakable immediacy. In Africa, when Linda and Thomas were twenty-seven, and in Massachusetts, when they were in high school, the novel re-creates love at its exhilarating pinnacle - the kind of intense connection that becomes the true north against which all relationships are measured. Moving backward through time, The Last Time They Met traces the extraordinary resonance a single choice, even a single word, can have over the course of a lifetime. At the same time, the novel creates an almost unbearable mystery, a mystery that can only be understood fully in the novel's final pages, in the eyes of young Linda Fallon and the young man who loves her. <br /><br />With a master's control of phrase, observation, emotion, and character, Anita Shreve has written a beautiful and unforgettable exploration of intimacy, loss, and lifelong desire.",

Since the king spent all his time sitting at the door for favors (favors being offered to the king, you understand), whenever he heard someone knocking at the door for petitions, he would pretend not to hear . . .\" Why the petitioner required a boat, where he was bound for, and who volunteered to crew for him, the reader will discover in this delightful fable, a philosophic love story worthy of Swift or Voltaire.<br />",

That journey leads to the \u2018happy land of the Trinity.\u2019 It is there that joys, almost unimaginable in this world, begin. Begin\u2014not end.\u201d <i>\u2014from the preface</i><br /><br />In <i>The Screwtape Letters</i>, C.S. Lewis\u2019s famous devil derides the Christian year as \u201cThe Same Old Thing.\u201d To combat this, Walter Hooper has drawn from Lewis\u2019s vast bibliography, accumulating short meditations that correspond to each day of the Christian calendar. Hooper has chosen passages that emphasize Lewis\u2019 illuminatingly matter-of-fact approach to religion, with each entry focused on themes such as \u201cNearness to God,\u201d \u201cHeaven and Sexuality,\u201d or \u201cTwo Kinds of Good and Bad.\u201d In addition to providing food for thought, these bite-sized excerpts facilitate a yearlong journey towards achieving the joy that Lewis wrote is \u201cthe serious business of heaven.\u201d<br /><br />\"The point about reading C. S. Lewis is that he makes you sure, whatever you believe, that religion accepted or rejected means something extremely serious, demanding the entire energy of the mind.\" \u2014<i>Harper\u2019s</i><br /><br />\"A potent anthology.\" \u2014<i>Los Angeles Times</i>",

    "description": "Winner of the Whitbread Award for best novel and a finalist for the Man Booker Prize, <i>The Accidental</i> is the virtuoso new novel by the singularly gifted Ali Smith. Jonathan Safran Foer has called her writing \u201cthrilling.\u201d Jeanette Winterson has praised her for her \u201cstyle, ideas, and punch.\u201d Here, in a novel at once profound, playful, and exhilaratingly inventive, she transfixes us with a portrait of a family unraveled by a mysterious visitor.<br /><br />Amber\u2014thirtysomething and barefoot\u2014shows up at the door of the Norfolk cottage that the Smarts are renting for the summer. She talks her way in. She tells nothing but lies. She stays for dinner.<br /><br />Eve Smart, the author of a best-selling series of biographical reconstructions, thinks Amber is a student with whom her husband, Michael, is sleeping. Michael, an English professor, knows only that her car broke down. Daughter Astrid, age twelve, thinks she\u2019s her mother\u2019s friend. Son Magnus, age seventeen, thinks she\u2019s an angel.<br /><br />As Amber insinuates herself into the family, the questions of who she is and how she\u2019s come to be there drop away. Instead, dazzled by her seeming exoticism, the Smarts begin to examine the accidents of their lives through the searing lens of Amber\u2019s perceptions. When Eve finally banishes her from the cottage, Amber disappears from their sight, but not\u2014they discover when they return home to London\u2014from their profoundly altered lives.<br /><br />Fearlessly intelligent and written with an irresistible blend of lyricism and whimsy, <i>The Accidental</i> is a tour de force of literary improvisation that explores the nature of truth, the role of chance, and the transformative power of storytelling.",

    "description": "If, as Darwin suggests, evolution relentlessly encourages the survival of the fittest, why are humans compelled to live in cooperative, complex societies? In this fascinating examination of the roots of human trust and virtue, a zoologist and former American editor of the <b>Economist</b> reveals the results of recent studies that suggest that self-interest and mutual aid are not at all incompatible. In fact, he points out, our cooperative instincts may have evolved as part of mankind?s natural selfish behavior--by exchanging favors we can benefit ourselves as well as others.Brilliantly orchestrating the newest findings of geneticists, psychologists, and anthropologists, <b>The Origins of Virtue</b> re-examines the everyday assumptions upon which we base our actions towards others, whether in our roles as parents, siblings, or trade partners. With the wit and brilliance of <b>The Red Queen</b>, his acclaimed study of human and animal sexuality, <b>Matt Ridley</b> shows us how breakthroughs in computer programming, microbiology, and economics have given us a new perspective on how and why we relate to each other.",

    "description": "\u201cThis killing will be a model of perfection. An accomplishment to be proud of. And it could be tonight or maybe next week. But it will be soon. I promise.\u201d<br /><br />The anonymous phone calls indicate a disturbed mind with an unnatural passion for death. Cooper and Fry are hoping against hope that the caller is just a harmless crank having some sick fun. But the clues woven through his disturbing messages point to the possibility of an all-too-real crime . . . especially when a woman vanishes from an office parking garage.<br /><br />But it\u2019s the mystery surrounding an unidentified female corpse left exposed in the woods for over a year that really has the detectives worried. Whoever she might have been, the dead woman is linked to the mystery caller, whose description of his twisted death rituals matches the bizarre manner in which the body was found. And the mystery only deepens when Cooper obtains a positive I.D. and learns that the dead woman was never reported missing and that she definitely wasn\u2019t murdered. As the killer draws them closer into his confidence, Ben and Diane learn everything about his deadly obsessions except what matters most: his identity and the identity of his next victim. . . .",

In the 1970s in Northern California a father and his teenage daughters, Anna and Claire, work their farm with the help of Coop, an enigmatic young man who makes his home with them. Theirs is a makeshift family, until it is shattered by an incident of violence that sets fire to the rest of their lives.<br /><br /><i>Divisadero</i> takes us from San Francisco to the raucous backrooms of Nevada's casinos and eventually to the landscape of southern France. As the narrative moves back and forth through time and place, we find each of the characters trying to find some foothold in a present shadowed by the past.",

    "description": "New Orleans natives Rickey and G-man are lifetime friends and down-and-out line cooks desperate to make a quick buck. When Rickey concocts the idea of opening a restaurant in their alcohol-loving hometown where every dish packs a spirited punch, they know they're on their way to the bank. With some wheeling and dealing, a slew of great recipes, and a few lucky breaks, Rickey and G-man are soon on their way to opening Liquor, their very own restaurant. But first they need to pacify a local crank who doesn't want to see his neighborhood disturbed, sidestep Rickey's deranged ex-boss, rein in their big-mouth silent partner before he runs amok, and stay afloat in a stew of corruption in a town well known for its bottom feeders.<br /><br />A manic, spicy romp through the kitchens, back alleys, dive bars, and drug deals of the country's most sublimely ridiculous city, author Poppy Z. Brite masterfully shakes equal parts ambition, scandal, fil\u00e9 powder, cocaine, and murder, and serves <b>Liquor</b> straight up, with a twist.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",

    "description": "American readers were introduced to the award-winning Sudanese author Leila Aboulela with <i>Minaret</i>, a delicate tale of a privileged young African Muslim woman adjusting to her new life as a maid in London. Now, for the first time in North America, we step back to her extraordinarily assured debut about a widowed Muslim mother living in Aberdeen who falls in love with a Scottish secular academic. Sammar is a Sudanese widow working as an Arabic translator at a Scottish university. Since the sudden death of her husband, her young son has gone to live with family in Khartoum, leaving Sammar alone in cold, gray Aberdeen, grieving and isolated. But when she begins to translate for Rae, a Scottish Islamic scholar, the two develop a deep friendship that awakens in Sammar all the longing for life she has repressed. As Rae and Sammar fall in love, she knows they will have to address his lack of faith in all that Sammar holds sacred. An exquisitely crafted meditation on love, both human and divine, <i>The Translator</i> is ultimately the story of one woman\u2019s courage to stay true to her beliefs, herself, and her newfound love.",
