    "description": "Girls may be called \"sluts\" for any number of reasons, including being outsiders, early developers, victims of rape, targets of others' revenge. Often the labels has nothing to do with sex -- the girls simply do not fit in.\u00a0 An important account of the lives of these young women,\u00a0<em>Slut!</em> weaves together powerful oral histories of girls and women who finally overcame their sexual labels with a cogent analysis of the underlying problem of sexual stereotyping.<br /><br />Author Leora Tanenbaum herself was labeled a slut in high school.\u00a0 The confessional article she wrote for <em>Seventeen</em> about the experience caused a sensation and led her to write this book.",

In this follow-up collection, the editors once again tackle the question: \u201cHow short can a story be and truly be a story?\u201d Determined to find the best flashes from America in the twenty-first century, James Thomas and Robert Shapard searched everywhere for stories that were not merely good but memorable. Moving, and certainly unforgettable, this collection includes stories from the best and most popular fiction writers of our time, including Ron Carlson, Robert Coover, Steve Almond, Amy Hempel, A. M. Homes, Grace Paley, and Paul Theroux. In addition, Rick Moody properly defines armoire, Lydia Davis delves into a world of cats, and Dave Eggers explores narrow escapes. Over and over, these stories prove that often less is more.",

    "description": "<b>Foreign Tongue</b><p><br />The humorist David Sedaris, with famously sly and hilarious National Public Radio commentaries and three previous books of essays and stories to his name, has, for quite a while, been a darling of that portion of the literati that actually possesses a sense of fun and mischief (it is smaller than you might think). His first book, <i>Barrel Fever,</i> which included what is now perhaps his best-known piece, \"The SantaLand Diaries,\" was heralded as the work of shining new voice in humor writing; his second, the bestselling <i>Naked,</i> grabbed the attention of the reading masses and won him national acclaim. <i>Holidays on Ice,</i> his third book, also universally adored, was short and only contained three new stories\u0097no less funny than the previous two, it was nonetheless a pretty slim package. In a way it was inevitable, then, that his new book, <i>Me Talk Pretty One Day,</i> would be received not only with the by now customary roar of approval but with a certain amount of negative backlash as well, as some critics periodically feel the need to prove that they are as capable of hopping off the bandwagon as they are of jumping on it, and the time is right to hit Sedaris with a bit of revenge for his continued success. And so it is not entirely unexpected that we are beginning to see reviews stating that although he is unquestionably an extraordinarily talented writer, Mr. Sedaris lacks the desire to produce anything of real significance. His salty, barbed observations, while endlessly amusing and insightful, never make it beyond the level of light entertainment. </p><p><br />What a load of crapola. </p><p><br />The essential fallacy in this thinking, of course, lies in the fact that it is precisely Sedaris' aversion to making too much of the little scenes and scenarios that he captures that makes the writing so enjoyable. He is a master of ferreting out the silly and the poignant from where it lies hidden in the seemingly mundane, and that's one of the reasons that reading him is such a pleasure: He reminds us that things that seem boring never really are if you just give them a little thought. </p><p><br /><i>Me Talk Pretty One Day</i> contains 28 personal essays, many of which have previously appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i> and <i>Esquire.</i> They touch on moments and themes from throughout his life, beginning with his youth in western New York State and North Carolina and moving right on up to his present incarnation as a semi-reluctant expatriate (a term he loathes) in Paris. What was funny, touching, and insightful in his earlier books is again in evidence here, only a bit more so; Sedaris hasn't changed his tune, but he has enhanced it, and the laughs in this collection come at a furious pace. </p><p><br />His profoundly bizarre family, whom he clearly loves and whose remarkable weirdness he clearly revels in, figures prominently. Sedaris' father, a character of sublimely comic eccentricity, gets the most attention, but there is also much about his sister, Amy, star of the Comedy Central sitcom \"Strangers with Candy,\" and one story entirely devoted to his younger brother, a gangsta-talking vulgarian who calls himself \"The Rooster\" and who is responsible for some of the book's choicest moments of hilarity. Pieces written from Paris make up the latter half or so of the collection. They are refreshingly free of loving descriptions of darling little bakeries just down the block from his apartment, sprawling caf\ufffd scenes, and how the reflected lights of the great city glitter on the Seine at midnight. His observations of French life, filtered through the inimitable Sedaris lens of ecstatic narcissism and brutal self-deprecation, come across as unconventional because he just doesn't seem too terribly thrilled by the place in either a good or bad way; he slaughters Americans in Paris for misinterpreting and failing to appreciate all they come in contact with and does equal damage to the French themselves for a huge catalogue of offenses, but it all feels like part of a day's work. It's just more foil for his scathing wit, which even in Paris has happily remained as formidable as ever. P<br />Littered throughout these missives from France are episodes documenting his struggles with the language that, to anyone who has ever been abroad and attempted to communicate, will ring true. These are some of the most enjoyable moments in the book. In the titular essay, Sedaris writes about the pitiful progress he is making in his French class, and about his terror of going through the day unable to properly express himself: blockquote<br />My only comfort was the knowledge that I was not alone. Huddled in the hallways and making the most of our pathetic French, my fellow students and I engaged in the sort of conversation commonly overheard in refugee camps. P<br />\"Sometimes me cry alone at night.\" P<br />\"That be common for I, also, but be more strong, you. Much work and someday you talk pretty. People stop hate you soon. Maybe tomorrow, okay.\"/blockquote<br />There are reasons why David Sedaris has achieved such notoriety as an author and radio commentator, and they include neither an irrepressible drive to reveal the human condition in all its guises nor a willingness to experiment with exciting new forms of literary confessional. Rather, by combining impeccable comic timing, a gift for revealing and expounding on other people's idiocy and weakness, and a defiant proclivity for wallowing in his own soul-blackening depravity, he has developed a style of writing that sets him above every other humorist writing today. IMe Talk Pretty One Day/I is the work of an exceptional writer working at the top of his game, a sassy and silly tour de force. It is brilliantly funny and should, under no circumstances, be read while attempting to eat or drink anything that might leave a stain. If you have read Sedaris before, you'll know what you're in for. If not, this is as good a place to start as any. And start you most certainly should. P<br />#151;IOlli Chanoff/IP</p>",

But the murders in this dazzling world of make-believe are no longer mere stagecraft, and the blood is all too real. The hunt for his child has plunged former Seattle Homicide Detective J.P. Beaumont into a bone-chilling drama of revenge, greed, and butchery, where innocents are made to suffer in perverse and terrible ways. And many more young lives are at stake, unless he can uncover the villain of the piece before the final, deadly curtain falls.",

Tansky's Cigar &amp; Soda is a home for its argumentative regulars, secret copies of <i>\"The Art Of Kissing\"</i> are consulted, and the resident Jews eye the French with suspicion. On the street, the famous Duddy Kravitz proffers sex advice, which is much needed because <b>Mordecai's</b> Mother had told him babies come from department stores and had threatened to exchange him for a girl. It adds up to a feast of wit and nostaligia from our acclaimed author.",

    "description": "<b>Man Booker Prize Winner (1992)</b><br /><br />Haunting and harrowing, as beautiful as it is disturbing, <i>The English Patient</i> tells the story of the entanglement of four damaged lives in an Italian monastery as World War II ends. The exhausted nurse, Hana; the maimed thief, Caravaggio; the wary sapper, Kip: each is haunted by the riddle of the English patient, the nameless burn victim who lies in an upstairs room and whose memories of passion, betrayal, and rescue illuminate this book like flashes of heat lightning. In lyrical prose informed by a poetic consciousness, Michael Ondaatje weaves these characters together, pulls them tight, then unravels the threads with unsettling acumen. <p>A book that binds readers of great literature, <i>The English Patient</i> garnered the Booker Prize for author Ondaatje. The poet and novelist has also written <i>In the Skin of a Lion</i>, <i>Coming Through Slaughter</i> and <i>The Collected Works of Billy the Kid</i>; two collections of poems, <i>The Cinnamon Peeler</i> and <i>There's a Trick with a Knife I'm Learning to Do</i>; and a memoir, <i>Running in the Family</i>.</p>",

    "description": "<i>The Metamorphosis and Other Stories</i>, by <b>Franz Kafka</b>, is part of the <i><i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i>\u00a0</i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i>:<br />All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics </i>pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.<br /><br /><br />Virtually unknown during his lifetime, <b>Franz Kafka</b> is now one of the world\u2019s most widely read and discussed authors. His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man\u2019s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka\u2019s masterpiece, \u201c<i>The Metamorphosis</i>,\u201d a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature. <br /><br />Bringing together some of Kafka\u2019s finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author\u2019s artistry. \u201c<i>The Judgment</i>,\u201d which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough, and \u201c<i>The Stoker</i>,\u201d which became the first chapter of his novel <i>Amerika</i>, are here included. These two, along with \u201c<i>The Metamorphosis</i>,\u201d form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as \u201cThe Sons,\u201d and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family.<br /><br />Also included are \u201c<i>In the Penal Colony</i>,\u201d a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims, and \u201c<i>A Hunger Artist</i>,\u201d about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public. Kafka\u2019s lucid, succinct writing chronicles the labyrinthine complexities, the futility-laden horror, and the stifling oppressiveness that permeate his vision of modern life.<br /><br /><b>Jason Baker</b> is a writer of short stories living in Brooklyn, New York.",

Isolated from the western world, she devours the letters she receives from her brother in Hawaii. When her father reluctantly allows Lily to visit Jeff, she is thrilled-until he is called away.<br /><br />Left with the Kapaia family, Lily awakens to a new understanding of God's love and of who she was created to be. Returning home, her deepening friendship with Gabe Kapaia and her faith are tested by her father's increasingly stern ways. Will her obedience cost her the desire of her heart?",

    "description": "Bel Kaufman's <em>Up the Down Staircase</em> is one of the best-loved novels of our time. It has been translated into sixteen languages, made into a prize-winning motion picture, and staged as a play at high schools all over the United States; its very title has become part of the American idiom.<br /><br />Never before has a novel so compellingly laid bare the inner workings of a metropolitan high school. <em>Up the Down Staircase</em> is the funny and touching story of a committed, idealistic teacher whose clash with school bureaucracy is a timeless lesson for students, teachers, parents--anyone concerned about public education. Bel Kaufman lets her characters speak for themselves through memos, letters, directives from the principal, comments by students, notes between teachers, and papers from desk drawers and wastebaskets, evoking a vivid picture of teachers fighting the good fight against all that stands in the way of good teaching.",

One of the greatest masterpieces of American literature, it redefined the rules of poetry while describing the soul of the American character. Throughout his great career, Whitman continuously revised, expanded, and republished <b>Leaves of Grass</b>, but as Harold Bloom reminds us, the book that matters most is the 1855 original. In celebration of the poem\u2019s 150th anniversary, Penguin Classics proudly presents the 1855 text in its original and complete form, with a specially commissioned introductory essay by Harold Bloom.\u00a0<br /><br />For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700\u00a0titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the\u00a0series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date\u00a0translations by award-winning translators.<br /><br />",

But Charlotte Cooper, who needs a blacksmith for her livery, has other ideas. By law, a woman of good standing in the community can save a man from the gallows by marrying him. Humbled by the dramatic rescue and renewed in his faith, Sean's heart goes out to his new bride, a woman whose past has prompted her to guard her heart. Yet could the talk around town be true? Is the fiercely independent Charlotte falling for Sean Donovan?",

Nothing exceptional, just a typical fantasy about a boy, the kind of dream that most teen girls experience. But Pattyn Von Stratten is not like most teen girls. Raised in a religious\u2014yet abusive\u2014family, a simple dream may not be exactly a sin, but it could be the first step toward hell and eternal damnation.<br /><br />This dream is a first step for Pattyn. But is it to hell or to a better life? For the first time Pattyn starts asking questions. Questions seemingly without answers\u2014about God, a woman's role, sex, love\u2014mostly love. What is it? Where is it? Will she ever experience it? Is she deserving of it?<br /><br />It's with a real boy that Pattyn gets into real trouble. After Pattyn's father catches her in a compromising position, events spiral out of control until Pattyn ends up suspended from school and sent to live with an aunt she doesn't know.<br /><br />Pattyn is supposed to find salvation and redemption during her exile to the wilds of rural Nevada. Yet what she finds instead is love and acceptance. And for the first time she feels worthy of both\u2014until she realizes her old demons will not let her go. Pattyn begins down a path that will lead her to a hell\u2014a hell that may not be the one she learned about in sacrament meetings, but it is hell all the same.<br /><br />In this riveting and masterful novel told in verse, Ellen Hopkins takes readers on an emotional roller-coaster ride. From the highs of true love to the lows of abuse, Pattyn's story will have readers engrossed until the very last word.",

A wealth of surprises and contrasts, this collection ranges from the lyricism of \"Weather,\" in which a couple's life is thrown into chaos when the National Association of Meteorologists goes on strike, to the swampy sexuality of \"Eros,\" in which a room in a Parisian hotel on the verge of ruin is the catalyst for passion, to the brave confidence of \"A Scarf\"-new for this collection-which chronicles the realities of a fledging author's book tour. Playful, graceful, acutely observed, and generous of spirit, these stories will delight her devoted fans and win her new converts as well.",

With vitality and love, she urges him beyond the confines of the mundane to risk answering his true calling as a scientist and researcher. Not even her tragic death can extinguish her spirit or her impact on Martin's life.<br /><br />After years of work as a small town doctor and a research scientist, <i>Arrowsmith</i> heads for the West Indies with a serum to halt an epidemic. A tragic turn of events forces him to come to terms with his career and his personal life.<br /><br />As the son and grandson of physicians, Sinclair Lewis had a store of experiences and imparted knowledge to draw upon for <i>Arrowsmith</i>.",

    "description": "Celebrated Tolkien illustrator Alan Lee, a conceptual designer for the blockbuster films based on \"The Lord of the Rings\", contributes 50 beautiful full-page, full-color paintings to this elegant three-volume edition.<br /><br />One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, The Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell, by chance, into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. From his fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, Sauron's power spread far and wide. He gathered all the Great Rings to him, but ever he searched far and wide for the One Ring that would complete his dominion. On his eleventy-first birthday Bilbo disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest -- to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom. The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard, Merry, Pippin, and Sam, Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, Boromir of Gondor, and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider. <br /><br />Saga of a group heroes who set forth to save their world from evil. A brotherhood of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and people is formed to combat evil forces. Tolkien drew on his extensive knowledge of folklore and the classics to create the worlds and creatures described in the trilogy, which includes The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King.",

Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's earlier, less complex children's fantasy novel [book:The Hobbit|5907] (1937), but eventually developed into a much larger work which formed the basis for the extended <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/58083-middle-earth-universe\">Middle-Earth Universe</a>. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949, much of it during World War II.

    "description": "Night after night the beautiful woman walked beside the serene waters of Lough Glass. Until the day she disappeared, leaving only a boat drifting upside down on the unfathomable lake that gave the town its name. Ravishing Helen McMahon, the Dubliner with film-star looks and unfulfilled dreams, never belonged in Lough Glass, not the way her genial pharmacist-husband Martin belonged, or their spirited daughter Kit. Suddenly, she is gone and Kit is haunted by the memory of her mother, seen through a window, alone at the kitchen table, tears streaming down her face. Now Kit, too, has secrets: of the night she discovered a letter on Martin\u2019s pillow and burned it, unopened. The night her mother was lost. The night everything changed forever\u2026<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Paperback edition.</i>",

    "description": "OVER THERE<br /><br />When Raymond Gantter arrived in Normandy in the fall of 1944, bodies were still washing up from the invasion. Sobered by that sight, Gantter and his fellow infantrymen moved across northern France and Belgium, taking part in the historic and bloody Battle of the Bulge, before slowly penetrating into and across Germany, fighting all the way to the Czechoslovakian border.<br /><br />With depth, clarity, and remarkable compassion, Gantter--an enlisted man and college graduate who spoke German--portrays the extraordinary life of the American soldier as he and his comrades lived it while helping to destroy Hitler's Third Reich. From dueling with unseen snipers in ruined villages to fierce battles in which the lightly armed American infantry skirmished against Hitler's panzers, Gantter skillfully captures one infantryman's progress across a continent where guns, fear, and death lay in wait around every bend in the road.",

    "description": "<strong>National Book Award Finalist</strong><br /><br />No one in 1917 New York had ever encountered a woman like the Bar-oness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven -- poet, artist, proto-punk rocker, sexual libertine, fashion avatar, and unrepentant troublemaker. When she wasn't stalking the streets of Greenwich Village wearing a brassiere made from tomato cans, she was enthusiastically declaiming her poems to sailors in beer halls or posing nude for Man Ray or Marcel Duchamp. In an era of brutal war, technological innovation, and cataclysmic change, the Baroness had resolved to create her own destiny -- taking the center of the Dadaist circle, breaking every bond of female propriety . . . and transforming herself into a living, breathing work of art.",

Into this desolate theater come aid workers, missionaries, and mercenaries of conscience whose courage and idealism sometimes coexist with treacherous moral blindness. There\u2019s the entrepreneurial American pilot who goes from flying food and medicine to smuggling arms, the Kenyan aid worker who can\u2019t help seeing the tawdry underside of his enterprise, and the evangelical Christian who comes to Sudan to redeem slaves and falls in love with a charismatic rebel commander. <br /><br />As their fates intersect and our understanding of their characters deepens, it becomes apparent that <i>Acts of Faith</i> is one of those rare novels that combine high moral seriousness with irresistible narrative wizardry.",

Hassan, his servant and constant companion, is a Hazara, a despised and impoverished caste. Their uncommon bond is torn by Amir's choice to abandon his friend amidst the increasing ethnic, religious, and political tensions of the dying years of the Afghan monarchy, wrenching them far apart. But so strong is the bond between the two boys that Amir journeys back to a distant world, to try to right past wrongs against the only true friend he ever had.<br /><br />The unforgettable, heartbreaking story of the unlikely friendship between a wealthy boy and the son of his father\u2019s servant, <i>The Kite Runner</i> is a beautifully crafted novel set in a country that is in the process of being destroyed. It is about the power of reading, the price of betrayal, and the possibility of redemption; and an exploration of the power of fathers over sons\u2014their love, their sacrifices, their lies.<br /><br />A sweeping story of family, love, and friendship told against the devastating backdrop of the history of Afghanistan over the last thirty years, <i>The Kite Runner</i> is an unusual and powerful novel that has become a beloved, one-of-a-kind classic.",

    "description": "Reflections on America and the American experience as he has lived and observed it, by the bestselling author of <i>The Greatest Generation</i>.<p>In this beautiful memoir, Tom Brokaw writes of America and of the American experience. From his parents\u2019 life in theThirties, on to his boyhood along the Missouri River and on the prairies of South Dakota in the Forties, into his early journalism career in the Fifties and the tumultuous Sixties, up to the present, this personal story is a reflection on America in our time. Tom Brokaw writes about growing up and coming of age in the heartland, and of the family, the people, the culture and the values that shaped him then and still do today. His father, Red Brokaw, a genius with machines, followed the instincts of Tom's mother Jean, and took the risk of moving his small family from an Army base to Pickstown, South Dakota, where Red got a job as a heavy equipment operator in the Army Corps of Engineers' project building the Ft. Randall dam along the Missouri River. Tom Brokaw describes how this move became the pivotal decision in their lives, as the Brokaw family, along with others after World War II, began to live out the American Dream: community, relative prosperity, middle class pleasures and good educations for their children. \"Along the river and in the surrounding hills, I had a Tom Sawyer boyhood,\" Brokaw writes; and as he describes his own pilgrimage as it unfolded\u2013from childhood to love, marriage, the early days in broadcast journalism, and beyond\u2013he also reflects on what brought him and so many Americans of his generation to lead lives a long way from home, yet forever affected by it. </p><p>\n  <i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>\n</p>",

Sure the world has changed from the days when children were supposed to be seen and not heard, but things have gotten a little out of hand. What about some quality time for the grownups? Author Christie Mellor's hilarious, personal, refreshing, and actually quite useful advice delightfully rights the balance between parent and child. In dozens of short, wickedly funny chapters, she skewers today's parental absurdities and reminds us how to make child-rearing a kick. With recipes, helpful hints, and illustrations, this high-spirited book is the only book parents will really need and enjoy.",

Love, greed, hope, revenge, organized religion, and Hollywood are alternately tickled and throttled. Impossible to summarize and impossible to stop reading, this is a romantic comic odyssey that actually delivers and rewards.",

When the family maid challenges her to reach out to the less fortunate as a way to ease her own pain, Mary Swan meets Carl-and everything changes. For although Carl is her opposite in nearly every way, he has something her privileged life could not give her. And when she seeks his help to uncover a mystery, she learns far more than she ever could have imagined.",

    "description": "<b>There is a reason cell rhymes with hell.</b><br /><br />On October 1, God is in His heaven, the stock market stands at 10,140, most of the planes are on time, and Clayton Riddell, an artist from Maine, is almost bouncing up Boylston Street in Boston. He's just landed a comic book deal that might finally enable him to support his family by making art instead of teaching it. He's already picked up a small (but expensive!) gift for his long-suffering wife, and he knows just what he will get for his boy Johnny. Why not a little treat for himself? Clay is feeling good about the future. <br /><br />That changes in a hurry. The cause of the devastation is a phenomenon that will come to be known as The Pulse, and the delivery method is a cell phone. Everyone's cell phone. Clay and the few desperate survivors who join him suddenly find themselves in the pitch-black night of civilization's darkest age, surrounded by chaos, carnage, and a human horde that has been reduced to its basest nature...and then begins to evolve.<br /><br />There is really no escaping this nightmare. But for Clay, an arrow points home to Maine, and as he and his fellow refugees make their harrowing journey north they begin to see crude signs confirming their direction. A promise, perhaps. Or a threat... <br /><br />There are 193 million cell phones in the United States alone. Who doesn't have one? Stephen King's utterly gripping, gory, and fascinating novel doesn't just ask the question,Can you hear me now? It answers it with a vengeance.",

    "description": "<em>The Bell Jar</em> chronicles the crack-up of Esther Greenwood: brilliant, beautiful, enormously talented, and successful, but slowly going under -- maybe for the last time. Sylvia Plath masterfully draws the reader into Esther's breakdown with such intensity that Esther's insanity becomes completely real and even rational, as probable and accessible an experience as going to the movies. Such deep penetration into the dark and harrowing corners of the psyche is an extraordinary accomplishment and has made <em>The Bell Jar</em> a haunting American classic.<br /><br />This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.",

They stand out as one of the pinnacles in the critically neglected but perennially popular tradition of weird writing that includes E.T.A. Hoffmann and Charles Dickens as well as more recent masters like Jorge Luis Borges and Roald Dahl. With a cast of characters that ranges from man-eating flora to disgruntled devils and suburban salarymen (not that it's always easy to tell one from another), Collier's dazzling stories explore the implacable logic of lunacy, revealing a surreal landscape whose unstable surface is depth-charged with surprise.",

Dorian Gray is a young man of impossible physical beauty whose portrait -- painted by the artist Basil Hallward -- becomes connected on an occult level with the workings of his soul. Drawn into a corrupt and sensual life by the dissolute Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian remains young and beautiful, while the painting ages in his stead, ultimately becoming a monstrosity.<br /><br />Interwoven throughout is the author's brilliant commentary on beauty, art, love, and always, stunning wit.",

    "description": "Illuminating the dark side of the American century, <i>The Monster Show</i> uncovers the surprising links between horror entertainment and the great social crises of our time, as well as horror's function as a pop analogue to surrealism and other artistic movements.<br /><br />With penetrating analyses and revealing anecdotes, David J. Skal chronicles one of our most popular and pervasive modes of cultural expression. He explores the disguised form in which Hollywood's classic horror movies played out the traumas of two world wars and the Depression; the nightmare visions of invasion and mind control catalyzed by the Cold War; the preoccupation with demon children that took hold as thalidomide, birth control, and abortion changed the reproductive landscape; the vogue in visceral, transformative special effects that paralleled the development of the plastic surgery industry; the link between the AIDS epidemic and the current fascination with vampires; and much more. Now with a new Afterword by the author that looks at horror's popular renaissance in the last decade, <i>The Monster Show</i> is a compulsively readable, thought-provoking inquiry into America's obsession with the macabre.",

    "description": "<i>Newsday</i> has said that Nick Tosches \"casts brilliant black light.\" The <i>San Diego Reader</i> has said that \"Tosches's best sentences uncoil like rattlesnakes and strike with a venom that spreads poison through all the little Sunday-school ideas you've held dear.\" And <i>Rolling Stone</i> has said that \"Tosches can write like a wild rockabilly raveup. He can be elegant as a slow blues.\" <i>The Nick Tosches Reader</i> is the author's own selection of his best work over the past thirty years, including fiction, poetry, interviews, rock writing, investigative journalism, and criticism. First published in major magazines, obscure underground periodicals, and his own best-selling books, many of these selections deal with rock 'n' roll and cultural icons\u2014but there are also pieces on everything from William Faulkner to organized crime to heavyweight boxing, including the <i>Vanity Fair</i> feature that gave rise to Tosches's major new book on Sonny Liston, published by Little, Brown. Here is \"a unique and darkly impressionistic cultural history\" of the last three decades as only Nick Tosches could write it.",

    "description": "Never has the term <em>mad scientist</em> been more fascinatingly explored than in internationally recognized popular science author Clifford Pickover's richly researched wild ride through the bizarre lives of eccentric geniuses. A few highlights:<br /><br /><strong>\"The Pigeon Man from Manhattan\"</strong> Legendary inventor Nikola Tesla had abnormally long thumbs, a peculiar love of pigeons, and a horror of women's pearls.<br /><br /><strong>\"The Worm Man from Devonshire\"</strong> Forefather of modern electric-circuit design Oliver Heaviside furnished his home with granite blocks and sometimes consumed only milk for days (as did Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison).<br /><br /><strong>\"The Rabbit-Eater from Lichfield\"</strong> Renowned scholar Samuel Johnson had so many tics and quirks that some mistook him for an idiot. In fact, his behavior matches modern definitions of obsessive-compulsive disorder and Tourette's syndrome.<br /><br />Pickover also addresses many provocative topics: the link between genius and madness, the role the brain plays in alien abduction and religious experiences, UFOs, cryonics -- even the whereabouts of Einstein's brain!",

Erasing virtually all traces of 60s and 70s experimentation, American film in the 1980s has returned with a vengeance to a more linear, conventional style.<br /> In this newly revised edition of The Cinema of Loneliness, Robert Phillip Kolker continues and expands his inquiry into the phenomenon of cinematic representations of culture by updating the chapters on the directors discussed in the first edition--Arthur Penn, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, and Robert Altman--to include their latest work, and by substituting for the chapter on Francis Ford Coppola a chapter on the cultural, political, and ideological formations of eighties films and the work of Steven Spielberg. He incorporates new discussions to include the more recent films, such as Arthur Penn's Four Friends (1983) and Target (1985); Stanley Kubrick's direction of The Shining (1980) and Full Metal Jacket (1987); Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull (1980), The King of Comedy (1983), After Hours (1985), and The Color of Money (1986); and Robert Altman's A Perfect Couple (1979), Popeye (1980), Streamers (1983), A Fool for Love (1985), and Beyond Therapy (1987).<br /> Placing the films of Penn, Kubrick, Scorsese, Spielberg, and Altman in an ideological perspective, Kolker both illuminates their relationship to one another and to larger currents in our culture, and emphasizes the statements their films make about American society.",

From her first book, The Little Disturbances of Man, published in 1959, to Enormous Changes at the Last Minute (1974) and Later the Same Day (1985), Grace Paley's quirky, boisterous characters and rich use of language have won her readers' hearts and secured her place as one of America's most accomplished writers. Grace Paley's stories are united by her signature interweaving of personal and political truths, by her extraordinary capacity for empathy, and by her pointed, funny depiction a the small and large events that make up city life. As her work progresses, we encounter many of the same characters and revisit the same sites, bearing witness to a community as it develops and matures, becoming part ourselves of a dense and vital world that is singular yet achingly familiar.",

    "description": "Grant Borrows' life has just taken a drastic left turn. There's another man in the world wearing his face and living his life. What's more, the man he sees in the mirror is a stranger.<br /><br />Somehow, he's been Shifted -- his whole life fundamentally altered, in the space of a single breath. But the changes don't stop at skin-level. Inexplicably, he's able to affect objects around him by simply thinking about them. And as he soon learns, he's become the central figure in a vast web of intrigue that stretches from an underground global conspiracy to a prophecy dating back over seven thousand years, that tells of his coming. Enemies and allies find him at every turn, but one thing they all learn very quickly is that you don't want to push Grant Borrows too far...<br /><br />Can destiny be undone?<br /><br />The players are ready. The game is in motion. And the pace is Relentless.<br /><br />In the allegorical tradition of Tolkien and Lewis comes a powerful new myth for a new generation.",

    "description": "Set in 1860's Victorian England, Janice Graham's suspenseful new novel tells the story of Veda Grenfell, a passionate young woman with an indomitable spirit. Raised on Savile Row, the enclave of fashionable London tailors, Veda is every inch her father's daughter. She has inherited his talent, his sense of style, and his love of tailoring. When a fever leaves her deaf at the age of sixteen, shattering her hopes of marriage, only Grenfell's familiar workshop offers any promise of an active life. Determined to prove her worth in a world off-limits to respectable women, Veda eventually persuades her father to promote her to the front of the shop where she . She makes a name for herself as tailor to London's smart young sporting set.<br /><br />Veda matures into a woman of eye-catching beauty, inspiring the devotion of her dear and faithful tutor, Mr. Nicholls, as well as an ambitious Italian whose marriage proposal she rejects, with disastrous consequences for her father's firm. For years, Veda has been increasingly drawn to Harry Breadalbane, a young viscount with humane ambitions frustrated by the expectations of his class. Heedless of the unsettling rumors about Harry's family and his brutally powerful father, Veda has absolute faith in Harry's goodness. When passion turns to betrayal, she abandons her beloved Savile Row and sets off on a treacherous journey that will lead her into a world of deception, murder, and madness.<br /><br />In the classic tradition of richly detailed historical fiction, Graham's elegant prose paints a deeply human portrait of a girl both willful and confused, vulnerable and yet fiercely courageous. Veda's chronicle of her struggle to sustain ties with the hearing world, and her determination to seize for herself those dreams others try to deny her, render her character unforgettable and illuminate a world rarely imagined in literature.<br /><br />",

    "description": "FBI Agent Alex Cross is on vacation with his family in Disneyland when he gets a call from the Director. A well-known actress was shot outside her home in Beverly Hills. Shortly afterward, an editor for the Los Angeles Times receives an e-mail describing the murder in vivid details. Alex quickly learns that this is not an isolated incident. The killer, known as Mary Smith, has done this before and plans to kill again.<p>Right from the beginning, this case is like nothing Alex has ever been confronted with before. Is this the plan of an obsessed fan or a spurned actor, or is it part of something much more frightening? Now members of Hollywood's A-list fear they're next on Mary's list, and the case grows by blockbuster proportions as the LAPD and FBI scramble to find a pattern before Mary can send one more chilling update.</p>",

    "description": "Mike Sager is to drugs, porn, and crimes of desperate delusion what Dominic Dunne is to the society murder. In addition to his long-classic Rolling Stone story \"The Devil and John Holmes\" (which helped inspire the upcoming Val Kilmer film, Wonderland) and his groundbreaking GQ piece about murdered Irish investigative reporter Veronica Guerin (also the subject of a major film starring Cate Blanchett), Scary Monsters and Super Freaks is a wonderful rogue's gallery of up-close pieces about the most public failures of the American dream. From Rick James and his drug-fueled detour into white slavery to the life and suicide of porn starlet Savannah, from deep inside the beating of Rodney King and the Heaven's Gate cult suicides to Chuck Berry's sexual predilections, this book brings to high-profile true crime a highly identifiable voice and style. Currently Esquire's Writer-at-Large, Sager takes us along for the ride with a raft of other figures including the late NWA Rapper Easy E. Winner, the FBI agent who fell in love with his informant, and the highest ranking DEA agent to be busted for drug trafficking. This is a brilliant debut collection by one of America's most respected and stylish crime writers.",

For it is a place where change comes slowly. One day, Kit's mother disappears and the town gossips run wild with stories. The consequences for Helen's husband, her son, but above all for her daughter, Kit, are unimaginable and will leave not one of their lives unchanged.",

    "description": "A brilliant virtuoso of violence, Richard Marcinko rose through Navy ranks to create and command one of this country's most elite and classified counterterrorist units, <i>SEAL TEAM SIX</i>. Now this thirty-year veteran recounts the secret missions and Special Warfare madness of his worldwide military career - and the riveting truth about the top-secret Navy SEALs.<br /><br />Marcinko was almost inhumanly tough, and proved it on hair-raising missions across Vietnam and a war-torn world: blowing up supply junks, charging through minefields, jumping at 19,000 feet with a chute that wouldn't open, fighting hand-to-hand in a hellhole jungle. For the Pentagon, he organized the Navy's first counterterrorist unit: the legendary <i>SEAL TEAM SIX</i>, which went on classified missions from Central America to the Middle East, the North Sea, Africa and beyond.<br /><br />Then Marcinko was tapped to create <i>Red Cell</i>, a dirty-dozen team of the military's most accomplished and decorated counterterrorists. Their unbelievable job was to test the defenses of the Navy's most secure facilities and installations. The result was predictable: all hell broke loose.<br /><br />Here is the hero who saw beyond the blood to ultimate justice - and the decorated warrior who became such a maverick that the Navy brass wanted his head on a pole, and for a time, got it.",

    "description": "Here is the gorgeous and sinister story of Marius, patrician by birth, scholar by choice, one of the oldest vampires of them all, which sweeps from his genesis in ancient Rome, in the time of the Emperor Augustus, to his meeting in the present day with a creature of snow and ice. Thorne is a Northern vampire in search of Maharet, his 'maker', the ancient Egyptian vampire queen who holds him and others in thrall with chains made of her red hair, 'bound with steel and with her blood and gold'. When the Visigoths sack his city, Marius is there; with the resurgence of the glory that was Rome, he is there, still searching for his lost love Pandora, but bewitched in turn by Botticelli, the Renaissance beauty Bianca, with her sordid secrets, and the boy he calls Amadeo (otherwise known as the Vampire Armand). Criss-crossing through the stories of other vampires from Rice's glorious Pantheon of the undead, haunted by Pandora and by his alter ego Mael, tracked by the Talamasca, the tale of Marius, the self-styled guardian of 'those who must be kept' is the most wondrous and mind-blowing of them all.",

Both demon and angel, he is drawn to kill but tempted by goodness as he moves among the pantheon of Anne Rice's unforgettable characters. Julien Mayfair, his tormentor; Rowan, witch and neurosurgeon, who attracts spirits to herself, casts spells on others and finds herself dangerously drawn to Lestat; Patsy, country and western singer, who was killed by Quinn Blackwood and dumped in a swamp; Ash Templeton, a 5,000 year old Taltos whose genes live on in the Mayfairs. Now, Lestat fights to save Patsy's ghost from the dark realms of the Earthbound, to uncover the mystery of the Taltos and to decide the fate of Rowan Mayfair. Both of Anne Rice's irresistible realms - the worlds of Blackwood Farm and the Mayfair Witches - collide as Lestat struggles between his lust for blood and the quest for life, between gratification and redemption.",

The struggle draws them both into a terrifying supernatural realm where they find themselves surrounded by memories, by horrors, and by overwhelming truths. Battling desperately, they are at last propelled towards the novel's astonishing and unforgettable climax.<br /><br /><b>Violin</b> is crowded with the history, the drama, the invention, and the romantic intensity that have become synonymous with Anne Rice at her incomparable best.",

    "description": "A few days before his death in 1996, Larry Levis mentioned to his friend and former instructor Philip Levine that he had \"an all-but-completed manuscript\" of poems. Levine had years earlier recognized Levis as \"the most gifted and determined young poet I have ever had the good fortune to have in one of my classes\"; after Levis's death, Levine edited the poems Levis had left behind. What emerged is this haunting collection, <i>Elegy</i>.<br /><br /> The poems were written in the six years following publication of his previous book, <i>The Widening Spell of the Leaves</i>, and continue and extend the jazz improvisations on themes that gave those poems their resonance. There are poems of sudden stops and threats from the wild: an opossum halts traffic and snaps at pedestrians in posh west Los Angeles; a migrant worker falls victim to the bites of two beautiful black widow spiders; horses starve during a Russian famine; a thief, sitting in the rigging of Columbus\u2019s ship, contemplates his work in the New World. The collection culminates in the elegies written to a world in which culture fragments; in which the beasts of burden\u2014the horses, the migrant workers\u2014are worked toward death; a world in which \"Love's an immigrant, it shows itself in its work. / It works for almost nothing\"; a world in which \"you were no longer permitted to know, / Or to decide for yourself, / Whether there was an angel inside you, or whether there wasn't.\"<br /><br /><i>Elegy</i>, as Levine says, was \"written by one of our essential poets at the very height of his powers. His early death is a staggering loss for our poetry, but what he left is a major achievement that will enrich our lives.\"",

The mother of an illegitimate child, Hester is compelled both by her Puritan community and her awareness of her own moral autonomy to wear a scarlet letter \"A\", a symbol of her adultery, upon her clothes. Her child is seen as the evidence of her sin and her refusal to name her lover taken as a token of her moral perversity. However, Hester emerges from the novel a woman whose integrity is intact. Born from the heart of New England, The Scarlet Letter is as much about individualchoice and moral responsibilities as about the birth pangs of a nation. --This text refers to the Paperback edition.",

If Einstein and John Cleese had written a novel together, this would be it.\u201d\u2013Joseph Weisberg, author of <i>10th Grade</i><br /><br />Four friends set out into the night in Cambridge, Massachusetts, undeterred by the fact that one of them might actually be dead. Deb has perfected the half-hour orgasm. Grant, a geek, desperately desires Deb. Depressed Arlene has just improbably slept with Johnny, their leader, who recently and accidentally shot himself to death.<br /><br />But is he (or anyone) alive or dead until he\u2019s observed to be by someone else? Maybe not, according to Dr. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, the renowned physicist (1887\u20141961) who is, strangely, still ambling through the Ivy League town, offering opinions and proofs about how our perceptions can bring to life\u2013and, in turn, reduce and destroy\u2013other people and ourselves. And what does Schr\u00f6dinger have to do with the President of Montana, who just declared war on the rest of the country, or the Harvard Square bag lady who is rewriting the history of the world? What\u2019s the significance of the cat in the box, the \u201cmiracle molecule,\u201d or the discarded piece of luncheon meat?<br /><br />Answer: All will collide by the end of this hypersmart, supersexy, madly moving novel that crosses structural inventiveness with easygoing accessibility, the United States with our internal states of being, philosophy with fiction. In Adam Felber\u2019 s dazzling debut, science and humanity collide in a kaleidoscopic story that is as hilarious as death and as heartbreaking as love.<br /><br /></p>",

    "description": "From master mystery writer Robert Barnard, one of his early novels, \"Death of a Mystery Writer.\" <br /> First published in 1979, \"Death of a Mystery Writer\" received an Edgar Award nomination for \"Best Novel\" of that year. It's with great pleasure that Scribner reissues this beloved novel from one of the most respected names in crime writing.<br /><br />Sir Oliver Fairleigh-Stubbs, overweight and overbearing, collapses and dies at his birthday party while indulging his taste for rare liquors. He had promised his daughter he would be polite and charitable for the entire day, but the strain of such exemplary behavior was obviously too great. He leaves a family relieved to be rid of him, and he also leaves a fortune, earned as a bestselling mystery author.<br /><br />To everyone's surprise, Sir Oliver's elder son, who openly hated his father, inherits most of the estate. His wife, his daughter, and his younger son are each to receive the royalties from one carefully chosen book. But the manuscript of the unpublished volume left to Sir Oliver's wife -- a posthumous \"last case\" that might be worth millions -- has disappeared. And Sir Oliver's death is beginning to look less than natural.<br /><br />Into this bitter household comes Inspector Meredith, a spirited Welshman who in some ways resembles Sir Oliver's fictional hero. In Robert Barnard's skillful hands, Inspector Meredith's investigation becomes not only a classic example of detection but an elegant and humorous slice of crime.",

    "description": "Brilliant, provocative, outrageous, and brazen, Hunter S. Thompson's infamous rule breaking -- in his journalism, in his life, and under the law -- changed the shape of American letters, and the face of American icons. \"Kingdom of Fear\" traces the course of Thompson's life as a rebel -- from a smart-mouthed Kentucky kid flaunting all authority to a convention-defying journalist who came to personify a wild fusion of fact, fiction, and mind-altering substances. Call it the evolution of an outlaw. Here are the formative experiences that comprise Thompson's legendary trajectory alongside the weird and the ugly. Whether detailing his exploits as a foreign correspondent in Rio, his job as night manager of the notorious O'Farrell Theatre in San Francisco, his epic run for sheriff of Aspen on the Freak Power ticket, or the sensational legal maneuvering that led to his full acquittal in the famous 99 Days trial, Thompson is at the peak of his narrative powers in \"Kingdom of Fear.\" And this boisterous, blistering ride illuminates as never before the professional and ideological risk taking of a literary genius and transgressive icon.",

    "description": "Les Miserables is widely considered one of the greatest novels of the 19th century. First published in France in 1862, it is Victor Hugo's greatest achievement--the ultimate tale of redemption. Former prisoner Jean Valjean struggles to live virtuously after an unexpected act of forgiveness by a kindly bishop changes his life. His righteous actions change people's lives in surprising ways and culminate in romance between two young people. Now available as part of the Word Cloud Classics series, Les Miserables is a must-have addition to the libraries of all classic literature lovers.",

    "description": "Anne Rice, creator of the Vampire Lestat, the Mayfair witches and the amazing worlds they inhabit, now gives us the first in a new series of novels linked together by the fledgling vampire David Talbot, who has set out to become a chronicler of his fellow Undead.<br /><br />The novel opens in present-day Paris in a crowded caf\u00e9, where David meets Pandora. She is two thousand years old, a Child of the Millennia, the first vampire ever made by the great Marius. David persuades her to tell the story of her life. <br /><br />Pandora begins, reluctantly at first and then with increasing passion, to recount her mesmerizing tale, which takes us through the ages, from Imperial Rome to eighteenth-century France to twentieth-century Paris and New Orleans. She carries us back to her mortal girlhood in the world of Caesar Augustus, a world chronicled by Ovid and Petronius. This is where Pandora meets and falls in love with the handsome, charismatic, lighthearted, still-mortal Marius. This is the Rome she is forced to flee in fear of assassination by conspirators plotting to take over the city. And we follow her to the exotic port of Antioch, where she is destined to be reunited with Marius, now immortal and haunted by his vampire nature, who will bestow on her the Dark Gift as they set out on the fraught and fantastic adventure of their two turbulent centuries together.",

    "description": "<i>Kim</i> is Rudyard Kipling's finest work. Now controversial, this novel is a memorably vivid evocation of the life and landscapes of India in the late nineteenth century. Kim himself is a resourceful lad who befriends a lama, an ageing priest; and both embark on a combined quest. Whereas Kim has an insatiable interest in the varied activities around him, the lama seeks redemtion from the 'Wheel of Life'. Kim becomes involved in the 'Great Game', undertaking espionage for the British rulers. This engrossing and moving novel, with its diversity of memorable character, offers many insights into political, religious and social tensions.",

    "description": "It's twenty years since the Evenfall swept across the Vellum and the bitmites took reality apart, twenty years since Phreedom Messenger disappeared into the wilderness and Seamus Finnan was imprisoned in his own past. Twenty years of chaos but the Dukes, the remnants of the Covenant, still cling to power in their enclaves of order in the bitmite-devastated wilderness . . . in their Havens in the Hinter.<br /><br />Across the folds of time and space, though, rogues and rebels are rising up against the Empire. From a mediaeval fortress where wandering mummers stage a Harlequin play based on Euripides's The Bacchae and performed in the Cant ... to Kentigern where another Harlequin, Jack Flash, wreaks havoc on a fascist state that thought him dead. From a 1939 Paris where Jack Carter and Seamus Finnan, heroes of the International Brigades, seek to rewrite history -- to a 1929 Berlin where a very different Jack seeks to save the world from a history he has helped make real. Locked in an eternal battle of chaos and order, it seems everyone must play their part now, as rebel or tyrant, hero or villain.<br /><br />'It is, quite simply, stunning and the most powerful debut novel I've read since Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Norrell and Mr Strange' \" Forbidden Planet\" magazine",

Once they were human; now they are unkin, transformed by the ancient machine-code language of reality itself. They seek The Book of All Hours, the mythical tome within which the blueprint for all reality is transcribed, which has been lost somewhere in the Vellum - the vast realm of eternity upon which our world is a mere scratch.<br /><br />The Vellum, where the unkin are gathering for war.<br /><br />The Vellum, where a fallen angel and a renegade devil are about to settle an age-old feud.<br /><br />The Vellum, where the past, present, and future will collide with ancient worlds and myths.<br /><br />And the Vellum will burn. . . .",

Eugenides wanted the queen, not the crown, but he finds himself trapped in a web of his own making.<br /><br />Then he drags a naive young guard into the center of the political maelstrom. Poor Costis knows he is the victim of the king's caprice, but his contempt for Eugenides slowly turns to grudging respect. Though struggling against his fate, the newly crowned king is much more than he appears. Soon the corrupt Attolian court will learn that its subtle and dangerous intrigue is no match for Eugenides.",

    "description": "\"With her 1847 novel, <i>Jane Eyre</i>, Charlotte Bront\u00eb created one of the most unforgettable heroines of all time. Jane Eyre is an orphan, penniless and plain, but full of courage and spirit. She has endured incredible hardship to secure her humble status as the governess in the household of her brooding employer, Mr. Rochester. Jane's sharp wit and defiant nature meet with Rochester's sardonic temperament. The two become enmeshed in a deep, intense bond. But Rochester has a terrible secret- a remnant from his past that could threaten any hope of happiness with his only love.<br /><br />An unconventional love story that revolutionized the scope of romantic fiction, <i>Jane Eyre</i> is ultimately the tale of one woman's fight to claim her independence and self-respect in a society that has no place for her.<br /><br />This Signet Classic edition includes a new introduction by Erica Jong, who created another memorable heroine, Isadora Wing, in her classic 1973 novel, <i>Fear of Flying</i>.\"",

Simpson, Kenneth Starr vs. William Jefferson Clinton.\u00a0\u00a0Real Life as Entertainment is hardly a new phenomenon, but the movies, and now the new information technologies, have so accelerated it that it is now the reigning popular art form.\u00a0\u00a0How this came to pass, and just what it means for our culture and our personal lives, is the subject of this witty, concerned, and sometimes eye-opening book.",

    "description": "Bob Slocum was living the American dream. He had a beautiful wife, three lovely children, a nice house...and all the mistresses he desired. He had it all -- all, that is, but happiness. Slocum was discontent. Inevitably, inexorably, his discontent deteriorated into desolation until...something happened. <br /><i>Something Happened</i> is Joseph Heller's wonderfully inventive and controversial second novel satirizing business life and American culture. The story is told as if the reader was overhearing the patter of Bob Slocum's brain -- recording what is going on at the office, as well as his fantasies and memories that complete the story of his life. The result is a novel as original and memorable as his <i>Catch-22.</i>",

They send a bio-engineered crew--people who have been altered to withstand the pressure and breathe the seawater--down to live and work in this weird, fertile undersea darkness.<br /><br />Unfortunately the only people suitable for long-term employment in these experimental power stations are crazy, some of them in unpleasant ways. How many of them can survive, or will be allowed to survive, while worldwide disaster approaches from below?<br />",

    "description": "Lenie Clarke-amphibious cyborg, Meltdown Madonna, agent of the Apocalypse-has grown sick to death of her own cowardice.<br /><br />For five years (since the events recounted in <i>Maelstrom</i>0, she and her bionic brethren (modified to work in the rift valleys of the ocean floor) have hidden in the mountains of the deep Atlantic. The facility they commandeered was more than a secret station on the ocean floor. Atlantis was an exit strategy for the corporate elite, a place where the world's Movers and Shakers had hidden from the doomsday microbe \u00dfehemoth-and from the hordes of the moved and the shaken left behind. For five years \"rifters\" and \"corpses\" have lived in a state of uneasy truce, united by fear of the outside world.<br /><br />But now that world closes in. An unknown enemy hunts them through the crushing darkness of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. \u00dfehemoth- twisted, mutated, more virulent than ever-has found them already. The fragile armistice between the rifters and their one-time masters has exploded into all-out war, and not even the legendary Lenie Clarke can take back the body count.<br /><br />Billions have died since she loosed \u00dfehemoth upon the world. Billions more are bound to. The whole biosphere came apart at the seams while Lenie Clarke hid at the bottom of the sea and did nothing. But now there is no place left to hide. The consequences of past acts reach inexorably to the very floor of the world, and Lenie Clarke must return to confront the mess she made.<br /><br />Redemption doesn't come easy with the blood of a world on your hands. But even after five years in pitch-black purgatory, Lenie Clarke is still Lenie Clarke. There will be consequences for anyone who gets in her way-and worse ones, perhaps, if she succeeds...<br /><br /><i>\u00dfehemoth: Seppuku</i> concludes the final act (begun in <i>\u00dfehemoth: \u00df-Max</i>) of Peter Watts's chilling and powerful Rifters series.<br />",

Lenie Clarke, in a black wetsuit, walks out of the ocean onto a Pacific Northwest beach filled with the oppressed and drugged homeless of the Asian world who have gotten only this far in their attempt to reach America. Is she a monster, or a goddess? One thing is for sure: all hell is breaking loose.<br /><br />This dark, fast-paced, hard SF novel returns to the story begun in Starfish: all human life is threatened by a disease (actually a primeval form of life) from the distant prehuman past. It survived only in the deep ocean rift where Clarke and her companions were stationed before the corporation that employed them tried to sterilize the threat with a secret underwater nuclear strike. But Clarke was far enough away that she was able to survive and tough enough to walk home, 300 miles across the ocean floor. She arrives carrying with her the potential death of the human race, and possessed by a desire for revenge. Maelstrom is a terrifying explosion of cyberpunk noir by a writer whose narrative, says Robert Sheckley, \"drives like a futuristic locomotive.\" <br />",

For as long as I've lived in New York, whenever I've just wanted to think, or relax, or be happy, or even sad, my destination of choice has been, without fail, Pug Hill.</b>\n</i>For Hope McNeill, pugs are love, unconditional friendship, happiness, and freedom--all qualities currently in short supply in her own life. She's also short on time and apartment space, and for those reasons she doesn't have a pug of her own. But she does have Pug Hill in Central Park, where pugs (and their owners) from all over New York City convene.<br /><br />She also has a serious crush on one of her co-workers at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a flailing relationship with her squash-playing, cold-weather-loving boyfriend, and an unspeakable fear of public speaking. When Hope's father calls with a daunting assignment--to make a speech at her parent's fortieth wedding anniversary party--Hope is completely taken off guard. As a last resort, she signs up for a public speaking class, but can't help wondering, will it be enough?<br /><br />Some fears are so big that even all the pugs in the world might not be enough...",

    "description": "Initially, gallery manager Jane Laine isn't very impressed with \"it\" artist Ian Rhys-Fitzsimmons. Which could be kind of a problem, since she's the one who has to accompany him on a five-month international art fair tour. To get through it all, Jane figures she'll be a good sport and keep her critiques to herself. She's preoccupied enough with mending her own broken heart, re-thinking her career path, and dealing with her Schnauzer-obsessed family. But now, traveling with this alleged genius from London to Rome and beyond, she starts to understand the connection between art and love - and the fact that in both, perspective is everything.",

    "description": "When she was a girl, Lisa See spent summers in the cool, dark recesses of her family's antiques store in Los Angeles's Chinatown. There, her grand-mother and great-aunt told her intriguing, colorful stories about their family's past - stories of missionaries, concubines, tong wars, glamorous nightclubs, and the determined struggle to triumph over racist laws and discrimination. They spoke of how Lisa's great-great-grandfather emigrated from his Chinese village to the United States; how his son followed him, married a Caucasian woman, and despite great odds, went on to become one of the most prominent Chinese on \"Gold Mountain\" (the Chinese name for the United States). As an adult, See spent five years collecting the details of her family's remarkable history. She interviewed nearly one hundred relatives - both Chinese and Caucasian, rich and poor - and pored over documents at the National Archives, the immigration office, and in countless attics, basements, and closets for the intimate nuances of her ancestors' lives.",

And in a magnificent palazzo in the Venice of the Renaissance we see him emotionally and intellectually in thrall to the great Vampire Marius, who masquerades among humankind as a mysterious, reclusive painter and who will bestow upon Armand the gift of vampiric blood.<br /><br />As the novel races to its climax, moving through scenes of luxury and elegance, of ambush, fire and devil worship to 19th-century Paris and today's New Orleans, we see its eternally vulnerable and romantic hero forced to choose between his twilight immortality and the salvation of his immortal soul.",

    "description": "<i>Starfish </i>lit the fuse. <i>Maelstrom </i>was the explosion. But five years into the aftermath, things aren't quite so simple as they once seemed...<br /><br />Lenie Clarke-rifter, avenger, amphibious deep-sea cyborg-has destroyed the world. Once exploited for her psychological addiction to dangerous environments, she emerged in the wake of a nuclear blast to serve up vendetta from the ocean floor. The horror she unleashed-an ancient, apocalyptic microbe called \u00dfehemoth- has been free in the world for half a decade now, devouring the biosphere from the bottom up. North America lies in ruins beneath the thumb of an omnipotent psychopath. Digital monsters have taken Clarke's name, wreaking havoc throughout the decimated remnants of something that was once called Internet. Governments have fallen across the globe; warlords and suicide cults rise from the ashes, pledging fealty to the Meltdown Madonna. All because five years ago, Lenie Clarke had a score to settle.<br /><br />But she has learned something in the meantime: she destroyed the world for a fallacy.<br /><br />Now, cowering at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, rifters and the technoindustrial \"corpses\" who created them hide from a world in its death throes. But they cannot hide forever: something is tracking them, down amongst the lightless cliffs and trenches of the Midatlantic Ridge. The consequences of past acts reach inexorably towards the very bottom of the world, and Lenie Clarke must finally confront the mess she made.<br /><br />Redemption doesn't come easy with the blood of a world on your hands. But even after five years in purgatory, Lenie Clarke is still Lenie Clarke. There will be consequences for anyone who gets in her way-and worse ones, perhaps, if she succeeds. . . .<br /><br /><i>\u00dfehemoth</i>: <i>\u00df</i>-<i>Max </i>is the first of two volumes. The story will conclude in <i>\u00dfehemoth: Seppuku.</i><br />",

Stolen from their cribs and concealed in shadows to be raised by ghouls, they are now changelings in service to the creatures who rule the world Below and despise the world Above. Any human contact is strictly forbidden and punishment is swift and severe for those who disobey. <br /><br /> Raised by her widower father, Emmie Silvey has a precocious personality and striking yellow eyes that have left her a solitary child. But that changes when two women enter her life-one who stalks her, one who haunts her dreams- both insisting that her entire life is a lie and warning her of an encroaching darkness.",

Caitl\u00edn R. Kiernan first introduced Dancy in the pages of her award-winning second novel, Threshold (2001), then went on to write several more short stories and a novella about this unlikely heroine, each a piece, of which, has become an epic dark fantasy narrative. Alabaster finally collects all these tales into one volume, illustrated by Ted Naifeh (Gloomcookie, Courtney Crumrin)",

Something has murdered Saul Garamond's father, and left Saul to pay for the crime.<br /><br />But a shadow from the urban waste breaks into Saul's prison cell and leads him to freedom. A shadow called King Rat, who reveals Saul's royal heritage, a heritage that opens a new world to Saul, the world below London's streets--a heritage that also drags Saul into King Rat's plan for revenge against his ancient enemy,. With drum 'n' bass pounding the backstreets, Saul must confront the forces that would use him, the forces that would destroy him, and the forces that shape his own bizarre identity.<br /></div>",

    "description": "Ed McBain made his debut in 1956. In 2004, more than a hundred books later, he personally collected twenty-five of his stories written before he was Ed McBain. All but five of them were first published in the detective magazine Manhunt and none of them appeared under the Ed McBain byline. They were written by Evan Hunter (McBain's legal name as of 1952), Richard Marsten (a pseudonym derived from the names of his three sons), or Hunt Collins (in honor of his alma mater, Hunter College).<br /><br />Here are kids in trouble and women in jeopardy. Here are private eyes and gangs. Here are loose cannons and innocent bystanders. Here, too, are cops and robbers. These are the stories that prepared Evan Hunter to become Ed McBain, and that prepared Ed McBain to write the beloved 87th Precinct novels. In individual introductions, McBain tells how and why he wrote these stories that were the start of his legendary career.<br />",

    "description": "While traveling in Calgary, Alberto Manguel was struck by how the novel he was reading (Goethe's \"Elective Affinities\") seemed to reflect the social chaos of the world in which he was living. An article in the daily paper would suddenly be illuminated by a passage in the novel; a long reflection would be prompted by a single word. He decided to keep a record of these moments, rereading a book each month, and forming \"A Reading Diary\": a volume of notes, reflections, impressions of travel, of friends, of events public and private, all elicited by his reading. From \"Don Quixote\" (August) to \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" (February) to \"Kim\" (April), Manguel leads us on an enthralling adventure in literature and life, and demonstrates how, for the passionate reader, one is utterly inextricable from the other.",

Grazia, private secretary to the world-renowned Isabella d'Este, is the daughter of an eminent Jewish banker, the wife of the pope's Jewish physician, and the lover of a Christian prince. In a \"secret book,\" written as a legacy for her son, she records her struggles to choose between the seductions of the Christian world and a return to the family, traditions, and duties of her Jewish roots. As she re-creates Renaissance Italy in captivating detail, Jacqueline Park gives us a timeless portrait of a brave and brilliant woman trapped in an unforgiving, inflexible society.",

Those distinctions have been eradicated by a new cultural landscape where \u201cgood\u201d means popular, where artists show their work at K-Mart, <i>Titantic</i> becomes a bestselling classical album, and Roseanne Barr guest edits <i>The New Yorker</i>: in short, a culture of Nobrow<i>.</i> Combining social commentary, memoir, and profiles of the potentates and purveyors of pop culture\u2013entertainment mogul David Geffen, MTV President Judy McGrath, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Nobrow high-priest George Lucas, and others\u2013Seabrook offers an enthralling look at our breakneck society where culture is ruled by the unpredictable Buzz and where even aesthetic worth is measured by units shipped.",

Why does she have to go to the Isle of Mona to train as a proper lady when she's already a princess? But Eilonwy soon faces much more than the ordeal of becoming a dignified young maiden, for she possesses magical powers sought by the evil enchantress Queen Achren. When Eilonwy is put under a deep spell, Taran and his companions set out on a dangerous quest to rescue her. Yet how can a lowly Assistant Pig-Keeper hope to stand against the most evil enchantress in all of Prydain?",

    "description": "The tyrannical monster Zahhak upon whose shoulder grew serpents that feasted daily on the brains of Iran's youth; the giant hero Rostam who vanquished entire armies with his immense strength and military prowess; the inept Shah Kay Kavus whose greed and vanity brought incessant warfare and misery to the land he ruled; the bold princess Rudabe who defied two armies to pledge her love to the Iranian hero Zal--these are but a few of the charters who inhabit the world of the great Persian classic known as the Shahname, or Book of Kings. Completed in the eleventh century A.D. by the poet Abol-Qasem Ferdowsi, the Shahname describes in more than 80,000 lines of verse the pre-Islamic history of Persia from mythological times down to the invasion of the armies of Islam in the mid-seventh century A.D.<br /><br />From this long saga, Jerome Clinton has translated into English blank verse the most famous episode, the story of Rostam and Sohrab. It is a stark and classic tragedy set against the exotic backdrop of a mythological Persia where feasting, hunting, and warring are accomplished on the most magnificent scale. Matching the English translation line by line on the facing pages is the Persian text of the poem, based on the earliest complete manuscript of the Shahname, which is preserved in the British Museum.<br /><br />This lyrical translation of the tragedy of Sohrab and Rostam captures the narrative power and driving rhythm of the Shahname as no other English translation has. His rendering into modern blank verse is both faithful to the original and pleasing to the ear of the contemporary reader.",

Its destitute inhabitants scavenge garbage for food and shelter, no industry exists, and an elusive government provides nothing but corruption. Anna wades through the filth to find her long-lost brother, a one-time journalist who may or may not be alive. <i>New York </i>Times-bestselling author Paul Auster (<i>The New York Trilogy)</i> shows us a disturbing Hobbesian society in this dystopian, post-apocalyptic novel.",

    "description": "<b>The Barnes &amp; Noble Review</b><br /><br />Karen Hesse's Newbery Award-winning skills are put to great use in <i>Witness</i>, a poetic tale about friendship, fanaticism, and the deadly undercurrents of racial prejudice. The story takes place in a small Vermont town in the year 1924, revealing the devastating impact of the Ku Klux Klan on this pastoral, insular community. At the heart of the tale are two motherless girls who come to the attention of the newly formed Klan: 12-year-old Leanora Sutter, who is black, and 6-year-old Esther Hirsch, who is Jewish. <br /><p><br />Hesse tells her story, which is based on real events, through the eyes of 11 different characters. Each point of view is expressed in poetic form, but with a stark clarity of difference that makes the voices unique and identifiable. There is a fire-and-brimstone preacher whose sermons reveal him as a zealot and whose actions brand him as a hypocrite. There is a middle-aged farm woman named Sara who takes Esther under her wing despite the warnings of her neighbors, trying to help the child understand why the Klan has marked her and her widowed father as targets for their hatred. Esther's only other friend is Leanora, who is about to learn some harsh lessons on tolerance and hatred herself at the hands of the Klan. And linking them all together is 18-year-old Merlin Van Tornhout, a young man struggling to fit in with the adult world and determine for himself the difference between right and wrong. The remaining characters who circle the periphery of this core group reflect the various mind-sets and biases that were common during this era of fear and persecution, even in a setting as bucolic as the Vermont countryside.<br /></p><p><br />Hesse weaves real historic events into her tale, such as the murder trial of the infamous kidnappers Leopold and Loeb, giving the work a definite period flavor. Using prose that is both sparse and powerful, she builds the tension with a slow crescendo of inevitability that ends in violence, but also offers up an unforgettable lesson on the true power of friendship and acceptance. <i>(Beth Amos)</i></p>",

    "description": "Tom Clancy's Patriot Games is filled with the exceptional realism and authenticity that distinguished the author's two previous bestsellers, Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising. Patriot Games puts us on the cutting edge of another type of war -- the international battle of terrorism.<br />Years before the defection of a Soviet submarine will send him hurtling into confrontation with the Soviets in Red October, Jack Ryan, historian, ex-marine, and CIA analyst, is vacationing in London when the Ulster Liberation Army makes a terrorist attack on the Prince and Princess of Wales. By instinctively diving forward to break up the attack, he gains both the gratitude of a nation and the hatred of its most dangerous men. Jack Ryan must summon all of the skills and knowledge at his command to battle back against his nemesis.Patriot Games is a major new film from Paramount starring Harrison Ford.<br />Two Casettes.",

    "description": "Presenting by popular demand one of the most anticipated collections! The legendary artist Carl Barks created Scrooge McDuck and chronicled many of his most popular adventures. In addition to superb storytelling and wonderful entertainment, he left behind a character who was not only rich in his stories, but one for whom the stories themselves were rich. Modern master Don Rosa, beginning in 1994, undertook the task of recounting Uncle Scrooge's past in a serialized epic. The wonderful result of his efforts is now collected in trade paperback form by Gemstone Publishing as THE LIFE &amp; TIMES OF SCROOGE McDUCK.A collection of the celebrated 12-part Eisner Award-winning series that details the life of the young Uncle Scrooge. The story was originally serialized in the United States in <i>Uncle Scrooge</i> comics. Now it has been collected in one all-encompassing popularly-priced volume.",

    "description": "Fanny McCoy has lived in fear and anger ever since that day in 1878 when a dispute with the Hatfields over the ownership of a few pigs set her family on a path of hatred and revenge. From that day forward, along the ragged ridges of the West Virginia-Kentucky line, the Hatfields and the McCoys have operated not withing the law but within mountain codes of their own making. In 1882, when Fanny's sister Roseanna runs off with young Johnse Hatfield, the hatred between the two clans explodes.<br />As the killings, abductions, raids, and heartbreak escalate bitterly and senselessly, Fanny, the sole voice of reason, realizes that she is powerless to stop the fighting and must learn to rise above the petty natures of her family and neighbors to find her own way out of the hatred. <br />",

    "description": "A man with a faded, well-worn notebook open in his lap. A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever. Set amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories. . . until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. Allie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape. Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments, and fundamental changes that affect us all. Shining with a beauty that is rarely found in current literature, The Notebook establishes Nicholas Sparks as a classic storyteller with a unique insight into the only emotion that really matters.<br /><br /><i>Did You Know?---<br /><br />The Notebook was only the third novel in recent history to spend over a year as a hardcover best-seller?<br />One of the poems by Walt Whitman quoted in the novel is entitled \"To a Common Prostitute?\"<br />The title for the novel was chosen by Theresa Park, Nicholas's agent?</i>",

    "description": "Drop that quotation/sample/collage, sir! An enlightening, amusing, and frightening look at how the growth of intellectual property law is making us all less free to say and think what we want.<b>\n  <br /></b><br />In 1998 university professor and professional art prankster Kembrew McLeod trademarked the phrase \"freedom of expression\" as a joke, an amusing if dark way to comment on how intellectual property law is increasingly being used to fence off the culture and restrict the way we're allowed to express ideas. But what's happened in recent years to intellectual property law is no joke and has had repercussions on our culture and our everyday lives. The trend toward privatization of\u2014melodies, genes, public space, the English language\u2014means an inevitable clash of economic values against the value of free speech, creativity, and shared resources. Our irreplaceable cultural commons is being sectioned up and sold off to the highest bidders and the most aggressive litigators.<br /><br />In <i>Freedom of Expression\u00ae</i>, Kembrew McLeod gathers topics as diverse as hip-hop music and digital sampling, the patenting of seeds and human genes, folk and blues music, visual collage art, electronic voting, the Internet and computer software. In doing so, he connects this rapidly accelerating push to pin down everything as a piece of private property to its effects on music, art and science. <br /><br />In much the same way Eric Schlosser's <i>Fast Food Nation</i> tied together disparate topics to paint an alarming picture of the food industry, and written in a witty style that brings to mind media pranksters like Al Franken, Ken Kesey, and Abbie Hoffman, <i>Freedom of Expression\u00ae</i> uses intellectual property law as the focal point to show how economic concerns are seriously eroding creativity and free speech. It\u2019s later than we know.",

Beneath all the policy statements and bluster of politicians is a real world of lies, pain, and big money. <br /><i>Down by the River</i> is the true narrative of how a murder led one American family into this world and how it all but destroyed them. It is the story of how one Mexican drug leader outfought and outthought the U.S. government, of how major financial institutions were fattened on the drug industry, and how the governments of the U.S. and Mexico buried everything that happened. All this happens down by the river, where the public fictions finally end and the facts read like fiction. This is a remarkable American story about drugs, money, murder, and family.",

    "description": "From internationally renowned yoga teacher Gurmukh comes a book on pregnancy unlike any other. <i>Bountiful, Beautiful, Blissful</i> is a treasury of wisdom, information, and inspiration for pregnancy and motherhood based on the spiritual and physical practices of Kundalini yoga, which Gurmukh has taught for the last thirty years.<br /><br />With illustrated, step-by-step instructions, she teaches time-tested techniques, meditations, and exercises that will help you physically, mentally, and spiritually. In the timeless way that women have passed down wisdom surrounding birth and child rearing to one another for centuries, Gurmukh weaves folk stories and contemporary testimonials into a program designed to help you get profound results in the shortest possible time.<br /><br />The sections in this book cover each trimester of pregnancy as well as delivery and life with the baby. In her wise, gentle, and comforting voice, Gurmukh suggests meditations, exercises, and yoga positions to respond to the various needs of expectant and new mothers as you undergo dramatic body changes. Gurmukh also helps you explore and, when necessary, heal your own history and unconscious attitudes about pregnancy, birth, and parenting.<br /><br />In <i>Bountiful, Beautiful, Blissful,</i> Gurmukh gives you all the tools you need to have a healthy and happy pregnancy while increasing your connection to your partner and building compassion and prosperity. The ancient practices of yoga can lead you back to your own power as a woman, capable of more than you ever dreamed. All you need is a belief in the possibility of change and a commitment of as little as three minutes a day. Gurmukh has helped thousands of women and their families find fulfillment through the healing movements and meditations of Kundalini yoga---and she can help you, too!",

The American students of today are not the only readers who have been confused by him. Russian literary history records more divergent interpretations of Gogol than perhaps of any other classic.<br /><br />In a new translation of the comic classic of Russian literature, Chichikov, an enigmatic stranger and conniving schemer, buys deceased serfs' names from their landlords' poll tax lists hoping to mortgage them for profit and to reinvent himself as a likeable gentleman.",

So many readers were to take the advice of the King of Hearts that by the end of the nineteenth century the double Alice (1865 and 1872) had acquired a pre-eminent and unassailable position in children's literature. Lewis Carroll's use of logic, by which the ordinary is translated into the extraordinary in an entirely plausible way, is delightfully combined with an exceptional knowledge and understanding of the mind of the child. Satire, allusion, and symbolism weave deeper and mysterious meanings, lending a measure of immortality to Carroll's remarkable fantasy.",

    "description": "Chronicling some from the point of view of one of the twentieth century's most influential musicians, Woody Guthrie's <i>Bound for Glory </i>includes an introduction by Joe Klein, author of <i>Primary Colors</i>, in Penguin Modern Classics.<br /><br />'Now I been here an' I been there,<br />Rambled aroun' most everywhere'<br /><br /><i>Bound for Glory</i> is the funny, cynical and earthy autobiography of Woody Guthrie, the father of modern American folk music. He tells of his childhood running wild in an Oklahoma oil-boom town, the tragedies that struck his family and of life on the open road during the Great Depression - hell-raising and brawling in boxcars, all while singing to raise a dime for his next meal. But above all, this is a song for the America that Woody saw from his lonesome highway, as he travelled from one end of the country to the other with guitar in hand and the songs that made him a legend drifting out over the Dust Bowl. Adapted into an Oscar-winning film starring David Carradine, <i>Bound for Glory</i> is the moving true story of America's greatest folksinger.<br /><br />Woody Guthrie (1912-67), the son of a cowboy, was born in rural Oklahoma. When the Depression arrived, Woody hit the road and travelled round America. He became a folksinger, guitarist, actor, artist and broadcaster, and is best remembered for songs including 'This Land is Your Land', 'Roll On, Columbia, Roll On' and 'Worried Man Blues'.<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>Bound for Glory</i>, you might like Jack Kerouac's <i>On the Road</i>, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.<br /><br />'Wild as a train whistle in the mountains, a scrumptious picture of fighting, carousing, singing, laughing migratory across America'<br /><i>The New York Times</i><br /><br />'One of the patron saints of American rebelliousness'<br />Joe Klein<br /><br />'Even readers who never heard Woody or his songs will understand the current esteem in which he's held after reading just a few pages . . . always shockingly immediate and real, as if Woody was telling it out loud . . . A book to make novelists and sociologists jealous' <br /><i>The Nation</i>",

Angela Stock has added a new section to the Introduction where she reviews the romantic and darker, more cynical aspects of the play in the context of late twentieth-century stage, film and critical interpretations. She also tackles the critical fortunes of Hero and Claudio as they reflect the play's concerns with sexuality and misogyny, eavesdropping and deception.

    "description": "To the harsh domain of Rockbound -- governed by the sternly righteous and rapacious Uriah Jung --comes the youthful David Jung to claim his small share of the island. Filled with dreamy optimism and a love for the unspoken promises of the night sky, David tries to find his way in a narrow, unforgiving, and controlled world. His conflicts are both internal and external, locking him in an unceasing struggle for survival; sometimes the sea is his enemy, sometimes his own rude behavior, sometimes his best friend Gershom Born, sometimes his secret love for the island teacher Mary Dauphiny; but always, inevitably, his Jung relatives and their manifold ambitions for money and power.<br /><br />The balance of life on Rockbound is precarious and thus fiercely guarded by all who inhabit its lonely domain, but just as a sudden change in the direction of the wind can lead to certain peril at sea, so too can the sudden change in the direction of a man's heart lead to a danger altogether unknown.<br /><br />Enormously evocative of the power, terror, and dramatic beauty of the Atlantic sea, and unrelenting in its portrait of back-breaking labour, cunning bitterness, and family strife, Rockbound is a story of many passions-love, pride, greed, and yearning -- all formed and buffeted on a small island by an unyielding wind and the rocky landscape of the human spirit.<br /><br />Roockbound won Canada Reads in 2005.",

    "description": "Richard III is one of Shakespeare's most popular plays on the stage and has been adapted successfully for film. This new and innovative edition recognizes the play's pre-eminence as a performance work: a perspective that informs every aspect of the editing. Challenging traditional practice, the text is based on the 1597 Quarto which, brings us closest to the play as it would have been staged in Shakespeare's theater. The introduction, which is illustrated, explores the long performance history from Shakespeare's time to the present. The commentary gives detailed explanation of matters of language, staging, text, and historical and cultural contexts, providing coverage that is both carefully balanced and alert to nuance of meaning.<br /> Documentation of the extensive textual variants is organized for maximum clarity: the readings of the Folio and the Quarto are presented in separate sections, and more specific information is given at the back of the book. Appendices also include selected passages from the main source and a special index of actors and other theatrical personnel.",

The saga begins with Macx patriarch Manfred, a freelance \"venture altruist,\" giving away patentable high-tech ideas in exchange for endless handouts while looking forward to the day when nanotech-programmed smart matter surpasses humanity in intelligence and productivity. Fifteen years later, his adolescent daughter Amber is an indentured astronaut trolling the orbit of Jupiter, and by 2070, Sirhan is Amber's permanently space-bound offspring, paying witness to the fruits of his grandfather's early innovations as something ominous and nonhuman is systematically dismantling the planets from Pluto to Earth.",

    "description": "Less than 50,000 years ago humans had no art, no religion, no sophisticated symbolism, no innovative thinking. Then, in a dramatic change, described by scientists as 'the greatest riddle in human history', all the skills &amp; qualities that we value most highly in ourselves appeared already fully formed, as tho bestowed on us by hidden powers. In Supernatural Hancock sets out to investigate this mysterious before-&amp;-after moment &amp; to discover the truth about the influences that gave birth to the modern mind. His quest takes him on a detective journey from the beautiful painted caves of prehistoric France, Spain &amp; Italy to rock shelters in the mountains of S. Africa, where he finds extraordinary Stone Age art. He uncovers clues that lead him to the Amazon rainforest to drink the hallucinogen Ayahuasca with shamans, whose paintings contain images of 'super-natural beings' identical to the animal-human hybrids depicted in prehistoric caves. Hallucinogens such as mescaline also produce visionary encounters with exactly the same beings. Scientists at the cutting edge of consciousness research have begun to consider the possibility that such hallucinations may be real perceptions of other dimensions. Could the supernaturals 1st depicted in the painted caves be the ancient teachers of humankind? Could it be that human evolution isn't just the meaningless process Darwin identified, but something more purposive &amp; intelligent that we've barely begun to understand?<br />Acknowledgements<br />Part 1: Visions <br />1: Plant that enables men to see the dead <br />2: Greatest riddle of archeology <br />3: Vine of souls <br />Part 2: Caves <br />4: Therianthropy<br />5: Riddles of the caves<br />6: Shabby academy <br />7: Searching for a Rosetta Stone<br />8: Code in the mind <br />9: Serpents of the Drakensberg<br />10: Wounded healer <br />Part 3: Beings <br />11: Voyage into the supernatural <br />12: Shamans in the sky <br />13: Spirit love <br />14: Secret commonwealth<br />15: Here is a thing that will carry me away<br />16: Dancers between worlds <br />Part 4: Codes <br />17: Turning in to channel DMT<br />18: Amongst the machine elves<br />19: Ancient teachers in our DNA?<br />20: Hurricane in the junkyard <br />Part 5: Religions <br />21: Hidden Shamans<br />22: Flesh of the Gods<br />Part 6: Mysteries <br />23: Doors leading to another world <br />Appendices <br />Critics &amp; criticisms of David Lewis-Williams' Neuropsychological theory of rock &amp; cave art<br />Psilocybe semilanceata-a hallucinogenic mushroom native to Europe / Roy Watlng <br />Interview with Rick Strassman<br />References <br />Index",

    "description": "In the Introduction, Ronald Blythe comments <i>Emma</i> was the climax of Jane Austen's genius and the Parthenon of fiction. Jane Austen would have, no doubt, demurred in her cool, ironic way at this verdict; she herself wrote that she was planning to take a heroine in Emma 'which no one but myself would like'. Vital, interesting, complex and predisposed to play a power game with other people's emotions, Emma is none the less one of Jane Austen's immortal creations. Dominating the novel as she dominates the small provincial world of Highbury, her forays into the matchmaking arena bring her up sharply against the follies of her egotism and selfishness. The consequent crisis, her bitter regrets and the novel's happy resolution are plotted with Jane Austen's incomparable art in this sharp and gloriously sparkling comedy of self-deceit and self-discovery.",

    "description": "<p>Following the Bront\u00eb sisters through their many reincarnations at the hands of biographers, Lucasta Miller reveals as much about the impossible art of biography as she does about the Bront\u00ebs themselves. Their first biographer, Mrs Gaskell, transformed their story of literary ambition into one of the great legends of the 19th century, a dramatic tale of three lonely sisters playing out their tragic destiny on top of a windswept moor. Lucasta Miller reveals where this image came from and how it took such a hold on the popular imagination.</p><p>Each generation has rewritten the Bront\u00ebs to reflect changing attitudes - towards the role of the woman writer, towards sexuality, towards the very concept of personality. <i>The Bront\u00eb Myth</i> gives vigorous new life to our understanding of the novelists and their culture. It is a witty, erudite and refreshingly unsentimental unravelling of what Henry James described as \"the most complete intellectual muddle ever achieved on a literary question by our wonderful public.\"</p>",

It is a society ruled by savagery and deceit that shuns and discards the weak. Left orphaned and physically flawed, young Kira faces a frightening, uncertain future. Blessed with an almost magical talent that keeps her alive, she struggles with ever broadening responsibilities in her quest for truth, discovering things that will change her life forever.<br /><br />As she did in <i>The Giver</i>, Lowry challenges readers to imagine what our world could become, and what will be considered valuable. Every reader will be taken by Kira's plight and will long ponder her haunting world and the hope for the future.<br /><br />",

    "description": "Small Plains, Kansas, January 23, 1987: In the midst of a deadly blizzard, eighteen-year-old Rex Shellenberger scours his father\u2019s pasture, looking for helpless newborn calves. Then he makes a shocking discovery: the naked, frozen body of a teenage girl, her skin as white as the snow around her. Even dead, she is the most beautiful girl he\u2019s ever seen. It is a moment that will forever change his life and the lives of everyone around him. The mysterious dead girl\u2013the \u201cVirgin of Small Plains\u201d\u2013inspires local reverence. In the two decades following her death, strange miracles visit those who faithfully tend to her grave; some even believe that her spirit can cure deadly illnesses. Slowly, word of the legend spreads.<br /><br />But what really happened in that snow-covered field? Why did young Mitch Newquist disappear the day after the Virgin\u2019s body was found, leaving behind his distraught girlfriend, Abby Reynolds? Why do the town\u2019s three most powerful men\u2013Dr. Quentin Reynolds, former sheriff Nathan Shellenberger, and Judge, Tom Newquist\u2013all seem to be hiding the details of that night? <br /><br />Seventeen years later, when Mitch suddenly returns to Small Plains, simmering tensions come to a head, ghosts that had long slumbered whisper anew, and the secrets that some wish would stay buried rise again from the grave of the Virgin. Abby\u2013never having resolved her feelings for Mitch\u2013is now determined to uncover exactly what happened so many years ago to tear their lives apart. <br /><br />Three families and three friends, their worlds inexorably altered in the course of one night, must confront the ever-unfolding consequences in award-winning author Nancy Pickard\u2019s remarkable novel of suspense. Wonderfully written and utterly absorbing, The Virgin of Small Plains is about the loss of faith, trust, and innocence . . . and the possibility of redemption.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "The unholy alliance of the Political Right and the Religious Right threatens to destroy the America we love. It also threatens to generate a popular aversion to God and religion by identifying religious values with a pro-war, pro-business, pro-rich, anti-science, and anti-environmental stance.<br /><br />Over the past few decades, the Republicans have achieved political dominance by forging a union with the Religious Right. This marriage has provided a sanctimonious veneer for policies that have helped the rich get richer while ignoring the needs of the middle class and the poor, dismantling environmental and civil liberties protections, and seeking global domination. The Right champions the materialism and ruthless selfishness promoted by unrestrained capitalism and then laments the moral crises of family instability and loneliness experienced by people who bring these commercial values into their homes and personal lives. In response, the Religious Right offers insular communities for the faithful and a culture that blames liberals, activist judges, homosexuals, independent women, and all secular people for the moral and spiritual emptiness so many Americans experience.<br /><br />Yet, however distorted both the Right's analysis and its solutions to America's spiritual crisis may be, it wins allegiance by addressing the human hunger for a life with some higher purpose. The Left, by contrast, remains largely tone-deaf to the spiritual needs of the American people. It is the yearning for meaning in life, not just the desire for money or power, that lies at the core of American politics.<br /><br />Addressing the central mystery of contemporary politics -- why so many Americans vote against their own economic interests --\" The Left Hand of God\" provides an invaluable, timely, and blunt critique of the current state of faith in government. Lerner challenges the Left to give up its deeply held fear of religion and to distinguish between a domination-oriented, Right-Hand-of-God tradition and a more compassionate and hope-oriented Left-Hand-of-God worldview. Further, Lerner describes the ways that Democrats have misunderstood and alienated significant parts of their potential constituency. To succeed again, Lerner argues, the Democratic Party must rethink its relationship to God, champion a progressive spiritual vision, reject the old bottom line that promotes the globalization of selfishness, and deal head-on with the very real spiritual crisis that many Americans experience every day.<br /><br />Lerner presents a vision that incorporates and then goes far beyond contemporary liberal and progressive politics. He argues for a new bottom line in our economy, schools, and government. This is a fundamentally fresh approach, one that takes spiritual needs seriously in our economic and political lives. Presenting an eight-point progressive spiritual covenant with America, Lerner provides a blueprint for how the Democratic Party can effectively challenge the Right and position itself to win the White House and Congress. By appealing to religious, secular, and spiritual but not necessarily religious people, \"The Left Hand of God\" blazes a trail that could change our world and reclaim America from the Religious Right.",

    "description": "From the critically acclaimed author of <em>Mr. Timothy</em> comes an ingenious tale of murder and revenge, featuring a retired New York City detective and a young cadet named Edgar Allan Poe.<br /><br />At West Point Academy in 1830, the calm of an October evening is shattered by the discovery of a young cadet's body swinging from a rope just off the parade grounds. An apparent suicide is not unheard of in a harsh regimen like West Point's, but the next morning, an even greater horror comes to light. Someone has stolen into the room where the body lay and removed the heart.<br /><br />At a loss for answers and desperate to avoid any negative publicity, the Academy calls on the services of a local civilian, Augustus Landor, a former police detective who acquired some renown during his years in New York City before retiring to the Hudson Highlands for his health. Now a widower, and restless in his seclusion, Landor agrees to take on the case. As he questions the dead man's acquaintances, he finds an eager assistant in a moody, intriguing young cadet with a penchant for drink, two volumes of poetry to his name, and a murky past that changes from telling to telling. The cadet's name? Edgar Allan Poe.<br /><br />Impressed with Poe's astute powers of observation, Landor is convinced that the poet may prove useful\u2014if he can stay sober long enough to put his keen reasoning skills to the task. Working in close contact, the two men\u2014separated by years but alike in intelligence\u2014develop a surprisingly deep rapport as their investigation takes them into a hidden world of secret societies, ritual sacrifices, and more bodies. Soon, however, the macabre murders and Landor's own buried secrets threaten to tear the two men and their newly formed friendship apart.<br /><br />A rich tapestry of fine prose and intricately detailed characters, <em>The Pale Blue Eye</em> transports readers into a labyrinth of the unknown that will leave them guessing until the very end.",

    "description": "<b>Emotional Intelligence</b> was an international phenomenon, appearing on the<i> New York Times</i> bestseller list for over a year and selling more than five million copies worldwide. Now, once again, Daniel Goleman has written a groundbreaking synthesis of the latest findings in biology and brain science, revealing that we are \u201cwired to connect\u201d and the surprisingly deep impact of our relationships on every aspect of our lives.<br /><br />Far more than we are consciously aware, our daily encounters with parents, spouses, bosses, and even strangers shape our brains and affect cells throughout our bodies\u2014down to the level of our genes\u2014for good or ill. In <b>Social Intelligence</b>, Daniel Goleman explores an emerging new science with startling implications for our interpersonal world. Its most fundamental discovery: we are designed for sociability, constantly engaged in a \u201cneural ballet\u201d that connects us brain to brain with those around us.<br /><br />Our reactions to others, and theirs to us, have a far-reaching biological impact, sending out cascades of hormones that regulate everything from our hearts to our immune systems, making good relationships act like vitamins\u2014and bad relationships like poisons. We can \u201ccatch\u201d other people\u2019s emotions the way we catch a cold, and the consequences of isolation or relentless social stress can be life-shortening. Goleman explains the surprising accuracy of first impressions, the basis of charisma and emotional power, the complexity of sexual attraction, and how we detect lies. He describes the \u201cdark side\u201d of social intelligence, from narcissism to Machiavellianism and psychopathy. He also reveals our astonishing capacity for \u201cmindsight,\u201d as well as the tragedy of those, like autistic children, whose mindsight is impaired.<br /><br />Is there a way to raise our children to be happy? What is the basis of a nourishing marriage? How can business leaders and teachers inspire the best in those they lead and teach? How can groups divided by prejudice and hatred come to live together in peace? <br /><br />The answers to these questions may not be as elusive as we once thought. And Goleman delivers his most heartening news with powerful conviction: we humans have a built-in bias toward empathy, cooperation, and altruism\u2013provided we develop the social intelligence to nurture these capacities in ourselves and others.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",

Trollope describes the vacillations of a conscientious father, torn between the desire to marry his daughter to a cousin destined to inherit the family title, and his fear that the cousin, reportedly a scheming wastrel, is unworthy of her.<br /><br />Originally published in Macmillan's Magazine, May-Dec. 1870.",

    "description": "While Virginia Woolf--one of our century's most brilliant and mercurial writers--has had no shortage of biographers, none has seemed as naturally suited to the task as Hermione Lee. Subscribing to Virginia Woolf's own belief in the fluidity and elusiveness of identity, Lee comes at her subject from a multitude of perspectives, producing a richly layered portrait of the writer and the woman that leaves all of her complexities and contradictions intact.\u00a0\u00a0Such issues as sexual abuse, mental illness, and suicide are brought into balance with the immensity of her literary achievement, her heroic commitment to her work, her generosity and wit,\u00a0\u00a0and her sanity and strength. <br /><br />It is not often that biography offers the satisfactions of great fiction--but this is clearly what Hermione Lee has achieved. Accessible, intelligent, and deeply pleasurable to read, her Virginia Woolf will undoubtedly take its place as the standard biography for years to come.",

    "description": "Already dubbed <i>Microserfs 2.0</i> by some pundits--a winking allusion to Douglas Coupland's previous novel <i>Microserfs</i>, which similarly chronicled pop-culture-damaged twentysomething misfits flailing, foundering, and occasionally succeeding in the high-tech sector--<i>JPod</i> is, like all of Coupland's novels, a byproduct of its era and yet strangely detached from it. Only this time with a bold and very crafty narrative device: Douglas Coupland, novelist, is a character in Douglas Coupland's novel. Which, when you think about it, makes sense since the type of people Coupland depicts are precisely the type of people who consume Coupland novels. As the once-great comedian Dennis Miller might holler, \"Stop him before he sub-references again!\" Readers familiar with Coupland's oeuvre know what to expect with the characterizations here. They also know that Coupland on a roll is both savagely observant and laugh-out-loud funny: \"Bree was showing someone photos of her recent holiday visiting Korean animation sweathshops. She was bummed because she couldn't get into North Korea: too much legal juju. [She said] 'I just wanted to know what it's like to be in a society with no technology except for three dial telephones and a TV camera they won from Fidel Castro in a game of rock paper scissors.'\" Much of the book is like that, built on granular and meandering exchanges between characters about . . . stuff. While <i>JPod</i>'s flow is hobbled by some preposterous twists and character traits and by random words, phrases, and numbers splattered gratuitously across successive pages in oversized typeface, it's hard to imagine Coupland fans walking away disappointed. <i>--Kim Hughes</i>",

From a 16-page newspaper about punk bands and violence to stores, a clothing line, VICE Films, VICE TV, VICE Records, viceland.com, etc., VICE has become much more than a way for three guys to get laid. It's become a lifestyle, a degrading and disgusting lifestyle of sex and drugs and rock and roll and death. This book is a collection of the irreverent, hilarious and downright scary gonzo journalism that brought three losers from the crack houses of Le Plateau to the deluxe apartments of Manhattan.",

A powerful indictment of the often manipulative media coverage of youth crises and so-called alternative programs designed to help \"troubled\" teens, <i>Teenage Wasteland</i> draws new conclusions and presents solid reasons to admire the resilience of suburbia's dead end kids.<br /><br />\"A powerful book.\"\u2014Samuel G. Freedman, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br /><br />\"[Gaines] sheds light on a poorly understood world and raises compelling questions about what society might do to help this alienated group of young people.\"\u2014Ann Grimes, <i>Washington Post Book World</i><br /><br />\"There is no comparable study of teenage suburban culture . . . and very few ethnographic inquiries written with anything like Gaines's native gusto or her luminous eye for detail.\"\u2014Andrew Ross, <i>Transition</i><br /><br />\"An outstanding case study. . . . Gaines shows how teens engage in cultural production and how such social agency is affected by economic transformations and institutional interventions.\"\u2014Richard Lachman, <i>Contemporary Sociology</i><br /><br />\"The best book on contemporary youth culture.\"\u2014<i>Rolling Stone</i>",

An autobiographical account of Sylvia Plath's own mental breakdown and suicide attempt, THE BELL JAR is more than a confessional novel, it is a comic but painful statement of what happens to a woman's aspirations in a society that refuses to take them seriously...a society that expects electroshock to cure the despair of a sensitive, questioning young artist whose search for identity becomes a terrifying descent toward madness.",

    "description": "Groundbreaking 'spaghetti westerns' such as the 'Dollars' trilogy (starring Clint Eastwood as 'The Man With No Name'), and the magisterial <i>Once Upon A Time In The West</i>, made Sergio Leone one of the most popular directors in world cinema. Christopher Frayling's biography of Sergio Leone lovingly explores his body of work, and casts light upon the previously little-known details of his life.<br /><br /><br /> Sergio Leone was born into movies, his father a popular director of the silent era. Obsessed by the illusory worlds of cinema and theatre, captivated by the myths of the American West, young Sergio embarked on a fabulous career of his own. He made an icon out of the initially reluctant Clint Eastwood, and dallied with the Hollywood studio system, but always stuck to his guns: the gangster epic <i>Once Upon A Time In America</i> consumed 15 years of his life. But Leone's passion made for extraordinary cinema: a widely-adored collection of films, about which Christopher Frayling provides an unprecedented wealth of extensively-researched analysis and anecdotage.<br /><br /><br /> In this revealing biography Christopher Frayling, the widely-acclaimed author of <i>The Yellow Peril </i>explores the life of Sergio Leone, the world-renowned director of <i>the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, A Fist full of Dollars, Once Upon A Time in the West </i>and <i>Once Upon A Time in America.</i>",

In his introductory essay, John Cooper explains the presentation of these works, discusses questions concerning the chronology of their composition, comments on the dialogue form in which Plato wrote, and offers guidance on approaching the reading and study of Plato's works.<br /><br />Also included are concise introductions by Cooper and Hutchinson to each translation, meticulous annotation designed to serve both scholar and general reader, and a comprehensive index. This handsome volume offers fine paper and a high-quality Smyth-sewn cloth binding in a sturdy, elegant edition.",

    "description": "Tristan Egolf's new novel is a book about the return of an old curse \u2014 the Kornwolf, a ferocious werewolf whose nocturnal rampaging becomes increasingly impossible to ignore. <i>Kornwolf</i> takes the reader for a good old-fashioned romp in the stubble \u2014 a journey through the slums and honky tundra of rural Pennsylvania, where nothing quite passes for good or bad, sublime or dismal, discrete or brash. And then the monotony breaks. Something \u2014 a freak of creation \u2014 is running amok in the fields. To solve the mystery, three generations of prodigal sons \u2014 a writer and hometown boy who swore he'd never come back to Penn's Woods; a middle-aged former pugilist who runs a decrepit boxing gym; and a misfit, mute, beaten-down Amish boy \u2014 are brought together by the light of a blue moon, in a town called Blue Ball. On one level this is a masterfully orchestrated, hilarious, and compelling take on the classic horror yarn, on another, <i>Kornwolf</i> is a social satire of suburban sprawl, closed minds, and all manners and varieties of self-satisfaction \u2014 Amish, civilian, or... <i>other</i> \u2014 in the best tradition of Tom Robbins and George Saunders.",

Enjoy or die.\"--John Lydon<br /><br /></b>Punk has been romanticized and embalmed in various media. It has been portrayed as an English class revolt and a reckless diversion that became a marketing dream. But there is no disputing its starting point. Every story of punk starts with its idols, the Sex Pistols, and its sneering hero was Johnny Rotten. <br /><br />In <i>Rotten</i>, Lydon looks back at himself, the Sex Pistols, and the \"no future\" disaffection of the time. Much more than just a music book, <i>Rotten </i>is an oral history of punk: angry, witty, honest, poignant, and crackling with energy.</p>\n  </div>\n</div><br />",

    "description": "In his eagerly awaited fourth novel, \"New York Times\"-bestselling author Nick Hornby mines the hearts and psyches of four lost souls who connect just when they've reached the end of the line.<br /><br />Meet Martin, JJ, Jess, and Maureen. Four people who come together on New Year's Eve: a former TV talk show host, a musician, a teenage girl, and a mother. Three are British, one is American. They encounter one another on the roof of Topper's House, a London destination famous as the last stop for those ready to end their lives.<br /><br />In four distinct and riveting first-person voices, Nick Hornby tells a story of four individuals confronting the limits of choice, circumstance, and their own mortality. This is a tale of connections made and missed, punishing regrets, and the grace of second chances.<br /><br />Intense, hilarious, provocative, and moving, \"A Long Way Down\" is a novel about suicide that is, surprisingly, full of life.<br /><br />What's your jumping-off point?<br /><br />Maureen<br /> Why is it the biggest sin of all? All your life you're told that you'll be going to this marvelous place when you pass on. And the one thing you can do to get you there a bit quicker is something that stops you getting there at all. Oh, I can see that it's a kind of queue-jumping. But if someone jumps the queue at the post office, people tut. Or sometimes they say \"Excuse me, I was here first.\" They don't say \"You will be consumed by hellfire for all eternity.\" That would be a bit strong.<br /><br />Martin<br /> I'd spent the previous couple of months looking up suicides on the Internet, just out of curiosity. And nearly every single time, the coroner says the same thing: \"He took his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed.\" And then you read the story about the poor bastard: His wife was sleeping with his best friend, he'd lost his job, his daughter had been killed in a road accident some months before . . . Hello, Mr. Coroner? I'm sorry, but there's no disturbed mental balance here, my friend. I'd say he got it just right.<br /><br />Jess<br /> I was at a party downstairs. It was a shit party, full of all these ancient crusties sitting on the floor drinking cider and smoking huge spliffs and listening to weirdo space-out reggae. At midnight, one of them clapped sarcastically, and a couple of others laughed, and that was it-Happy New Year to you, too. You could have turned up to that party as the happiest person in London, and you'd still have wanted to jump off the roof by five past twelve. And I wasn't the happiest person in London anyway. Obviously.<br /><br />JJ<br /> New Year's Eve was a night for sentimental losers. It was my own stupid fault. Of course there'd be a low-rent crowd up there. I should have picked a classier date-like March 28, when Virginia Woolf took her walk into the river, or November 25 (Nick Drake). If anybody had been on the roof on either of those nights, the chances are they would have been like-minded souls, rather than hopeless f*ck-ups who had somehow persuaded themselves that the end of a calendar year is in any way significant.",

    "description": "In this best-selling biography, French and Argentine journalist Alicia Dujovne Ortiz examines the mythology that surrounds Eva Peron as she penetrates the complexities behind Peron's ever-lasting allure. Born in 1919, the illegitimate daughter of destitute Argentine farmers, Eva Duarte spent her adolescence aspiring to the grand and glorious fame of the theater. At the first opportunity, she fled the deprivation of her origins and the backwaters of her poor village for the glittering lights of Buenos Aires. However, because she lacked both formal training and talent to be an actress, Eva quickly realized that it would take many years of hardship for even a small chance at becoming the star of her generation. It was during this time of disillusion that Eva met Juan Peron. Abandoning her pursuit of stardom, Eva concentrated all of her efforts on helping the future dictator of Argentina ascend politically. Her theatrical ambition was substituted with the desire not only to launch her husband's career, but to remake herself as a figure of providence for the millions of impoverished workers of her country. With access to the newly declassified archives of the Peron government, Ortiz has uncovered new information, including connections between Juan Peron and the German Nazi party. Taking into account every source of information - many never available to any other previous biographer - Ortiz has tapped into dozens of personal testimonies, including that of Father Hernan Benitez, Eva's personal confessor, as well as Eva's own private memoirs.",

On rare occasions, a shadow soul can take over a stranger's body and commit hideous crimes. <br /> Sora, the High Chieftess of the Black Falcon Nation, has been plagued with blackouts and fits since her seventh winter. As her world goes black, two gleaming eyes burn inside her. Sora calls these occurrences the Midnight Fox; she remembers nothing of what happens when they take her. Now rival clans have accused her of seven murders, including the killing of her friend, the Loon People's war chief. As animosity toward Sora and the Black Falcon Nation abounds, she must find the necessary healing for her soul and mind, the courage to lead her people, and the strength to save her own life.",

Containing a fresh translation of the Greek papyri, as well as Coptic and Demotic texts, this new translation has been brought up to date and is now the most comprehensive collection of this literature, and the first ever in English.<br /><br /><i>The Greek Magical Papyri in Transition</i> is an invaluable resource for scholars in a wide variety of fields, from the history of religions to the classical languages and literatures, and it will fascinate those with a general interest in the occult and the history of magic.<br /><br />\"One of the major achievements of classical and related scholarship over the last decade.\"\u2014Ioan P. Culianu, <i>Journal for the Study of Judaism</i><br /><br />\"The enormous value of this new volume lies in the fact that these texts will now be available to a much wider audience of readers, including historians or religion, anthropologists, and psychologists.\"\u2014John G. Gager, <i>Journal of Religion</i><br /><br />\"[This book] shows care, skill and zest. . . .

This is the story of Lin Kong, a man living in two worlds, struggling with the conflicting claims of two utterly different women as he moves through the political minefields of a society designed to regulate his every move and stifle the promptings of his innermost heart.<br /><br />For more than seventeen years, this devoted and ambitious doctor has been in love with an educated, clever, modern woman, Manna Wu. But back in the traditional world of his home village lives the wife his family chose for him when he was young--a humble and touchingly loyal woman, whom he visits in order to ask, again and again, for a divorce. In a culture in which the ancient ties of tradition and family still hold sway and where adultery discovered by the Party can ruin lives forever, Lin's passionate love is stretched ever more taut by the passing years. Every summer, his compliant wife agrees to a divorce but then backs out. This time, Lin promises, will be different.<br /><br />Tracing these lives through their summer of decision and beyond, Ha Jin vividly conjures the texture of daily life in a place where the demands of human longing must contend with the weight of centuries of custom. Waiting charms and startles us with its depiction of a China that remains hidden to Western eyes even as it moves us with its piercing vision of the universal<br />complications of love.",

    "description": "The bestselling author of The End of Nature issues an impassioned call to arms for an economy that creates community and ennobles our livesIn this powerful and provocative manifesto, Bill McKibben offers the biggest challenge in a generation to the prevailing view of our economy. <br /><br />For the first time in human history, he observes, \u201cmore\u201d is no longer synonymous with \u201cbetter\u201d\u2014indeed, for many of us, they have become almost opposites. McKibben puts forward a new way to think about the things we buy, the food we eat, the energy we use, and the money that pays for it all. Our purchases, he says, need not be at odds with the things we truly value.McKibben\u2019s animating idea is that we need to move beyond \u201cgrowth\u201d as the paramount economic ideal and pursue prosperity in a more local direction, with cities, suburbs, and regions producing more of their own food, generating more of their own energy, and even creating more of their own culture and entertainment. He shows this concept blossoming around the world with striking results, from the burgeoning economies of India and China to the more mature societies of Europe and New England. <br /><br />For those who worry about environmental threats, he offers a route out of the worst of those problems; for those who wonder if there isn\u2019t something more to life than buying, he provides the insight to think about one\u2019s life as an individual and as a member of a larger community.McKibben offers a realistic, if challenging, scenario for a hopeful future. As he so eloquently shows, the more we nurture the essential humanity of our economy, the more we will recapture our own.",

    "description": "The attacks of September 11, 2001, were accomplished through an amazing orchestration of logistics and personnel. <i>Crossing the Rubicon</i> discovers and identifies key suspects\u2014finding some of them in the highest echelons of American government\u2014by showing how they acted in concert to guarantee that the attacks produced the desired result.<br /><br /><i>Crossing the Rubicon</i> is unique not only for its case-breaking examination of 9/11, but for the breadth and depth of its world picture\u2014an interdisciplinary analysis of petroleum, geopolitics, narcotraffic, intelligence and militarism\u2014without which 9/11 cannot be understood.<br /><br />The US manufacturing sector has been mostly replaced by speculation on financial data whose underlying economic reality is a dark secret. Hundreds of billions of dollars in laundered drug money flow through Wall Street each year from opium and coca fields maintained by CIA-sponsored warlords and US-backed covert paramilitary violence. America\u2019s global dominance depends on a continually turning mill of guns, drugs, oil and money. Oil and natural gas\u2014the fuels that make economic growth possible\u2014are subsidized by American military force and foreign lending.<br /><br />In reality, 9/11 and the resulting \u201cwar on terror\u201d are parts of a massive authoritarian response to an emerging economic crisis of unprecedented scale. Peak Oil\u2014the beginning of the end for our industrial civilization\u2014is driving the \u00e9lites of American power to implement unthinkably draconian measures of repression, warfare and population control. <i>Crossing the Rubicon</i> is more than a story. It is a map of the perilous terrain through which, together and alone, we are all now making our way.<br /><br /><b>Michael C. Ruppert</b> is the publisher and editor of <i>From the Wilderness</i>, a newsletter read by more than 16,000 subscribers in 40 countries. A former Los Angeles Police Department narcotics investigator, he is widely known for his groundbreaking stories on US involvement in the drug trade, Peak Oil and 9/11.",

Welcome to <i>The Land of Laughs.</i> A novel about how terrifying that would be.<br /><br />Schoolteacher Thomas Abbey, unsure son of a film star, doesn't know who he is or what he wants--in life, in love, or in his relationship with the strange and intense Saxony Gardner. What he knows is that in his whole life nothing has touched him so deeply as the novels of Marshall France, a reclusive author of fabulous children's tales who died at forty-four.<br /><br />Now Thomas and Saxony have come to France's hometown, the dreamy Midwestern town of Galen, Missouri, to write France's biography. Warned in advance that France's family may oppose them, they're surprised to find France's daughter warmly welcoming instead. But slowly they begin to see that something fantastic and horrible is happening. The magic of Marshall France has extended far beyond the printed page...leaving them with a terrifying task to undertake.",

The area's normally shy wolf population has begun stalking human prey, and their victims have been disappearing...or worse. Something is happening in the woods. Something brutal and primitive...<br /><br />Officer Jessie McQuade has seen plenty in her years on the force\u2014but nothing as intriguing as the gorgeous, naked man she encounters while tracking a rogue wolf. Professor Will Cadotte is a Native American activist. He's also the only man capable of distracting Jessie from her work. And for a cop, distraction\u2014no matter how pleasurable\u2014can be deadly. It's against Jessie's better judgment to accept Will's help in her investigation, yet she soon finds herself doing exactly that\u2014and more. Will's dark, penetrating eyes see into a part of Jessie's soul she never knew existed. It's exhilarating...and terrifying.<br /><br />Now, as a town's deepest secrets come to light, no one is safe: not friends, lovers, or strangers. And as Jessie follows a bloody trail to the shocking truth, she'll have to decide who she can trust when the moon is full...",

    "description": "In the bizarre world of Franz Kafka, salesmen turn into giant bugs, apes give lectures at college academies, and nightmares probe the mysteries of modern humanity\u2019s unhappiness. More than any other modern writer in world literature, Kafka captures the loneliness and misery that fill the lives of 20th-century humanity. The Metamorphosis and Other Stories reveals the author\u2019s extraordinary talent in a variety of forms\u2014prose poems, short stories, sketches, allegories, and novelettes\u2014and showcases the straight\u2013faced humor, startling psychological insight, and haunting imagination for which he is revered as a modern master. In this brilliant new translation, prize\u2013winning translator Joachim Neugroschel preserves the delicate balance, rich timbre, and wondrous language of Kafka\u2019s original works. In addition to \"The Metamorphosis\", this collection includes \"Early Stories\", \"Contemplation\", \"The Judgement\", \"The Stoker\", \"In the Penal Colony\", and \"A Country Doctor\".",

While the authorities panic and tourists and investors flee, three men, two women and a dog are drawn together by portents that burden them with a bemusing sense of responsibility. Travelling at first packed into a car, then into a wagon, they take to the road to explore the limits of their now finite land, adrift in a world made new by this radical shift in perspective.",

    "description": "Winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize for Literature. A city is hit by an epidemic of 'white blindness.' The blindness spreads, sparing no one. Authorities confine the blind to a vacant mental hospital secured by armed guards. Inside, the criminal element among the blind hold the rest captive: food rations are stolen, women are raped. There is one eyewitness to this nightmare who guides seven strangers through the barren streets. The developments within this oddly anonymous group -- the first blind man, the old man with the black eye patch, the girl with dark glasses, the boy with no mother, and the dog of tears -- are as uncanny as the surrounding chaos is harrowing. A parable of loss and disorientation, of man's worst appetities and hopeless weaknesses, \"Blindness\" is one of the most challenging, thought-provoking, and ultimately exhilarating novels published in any language in recent years.",

    "description": "Sex.<br /><br />God.<br /><br />You know the two subjects are connected; you just don't have the words for how they are connected. And they cannot be separated. Where the one is, you will always find the other.<br /><br /><br />When you actually live and feel and engage, you discover that the physical things around us are like windows into more. And when you talk about sexuality, you quickly end up in the spiritual - because \"this\" is always about \"that.\" Something deeper. Something behind it all.<br /><br /><br />You can't talk about sexuality without talking about how we were made. About how we relate to each other. About how we were made to relate to each other. And that will inevitably lead you to who made us. At some point you have to talk about God. <br /><br />To make sense of the one, we have to explore the other.<br /><br /><br /><br />That is what this book is about.",

    "description": "\u201cBernays\u2019 honest and practical manual provides much insight into some of the most powerful and influential institutions of contemporary industrial state capitalist democracies.\u201d\u2014Noam Chomsky<br /><br />\u201cThe conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.\u201d\u2014Edward Bernays, <i>Propaganda</i><br /><br />A seminal and controversial figure in the history of political thought and public relations, Edward Bernays (1891\u20131995), pioneered the scientific technique of shaping and manipulating public opinion, which he famously dubbed \u201cengineering of consent.\u201d During World War I, he was an integral part of the U.S. Committee on Public Information (CPI), a powerful propaganda apparatus that was mobilized to package, advertise and sell the war to the American people as one that would \u201cMake the World Safe for Democracy.\u201d The CPI would become the blueprint in which marketing strategies for future wars would be based upon.<br /><br />Bernays applied the techniques he had learned in the CPI and, incorporating some of the ideas of Walter Lipmann, became an outspoken proponent of propaganda as a tool for democratic and corporate manipulation of the population. His 1928 bombshell <i>Propaganda</i> lays out his eerily prescient vision for using propaganda to regiment the collective mind in a variety of areas, including government, politics, art, science and education. To read this book today is to frightfully comprehend what our contemporary institutions of government and business have become in regards to organized manipulation of the masses.<br /><br />This is the first reprint of <i>Propaganda</i> in over 30 years and features an introduction by Mark Crispin Miller, author of <i>The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder</i>.",

    "description": "In an era disgusted with politicians and the various instruments of \"direct democracy,\" Walter Lippmann's <em>The Phantom Public </em>remains as relevant as ever. It reveals Lippmann at a time when he was most critical of the ills of American democracy. Antipopulist in sentiment, this volume defends elitism as a serious and distinctive intellectual option, one with considerable precursors in the American past. Lippmann's demythologized view of the American system of government resonates today.<br /><br /><em>The Phantom Public </em>discusses the \"disenchanted man\" who has become disillusioned not only with democracy, but also with reform. According to Lippmann, the average voter is incapable of governance; what is called the public is merely a \"phantom.\" In terms of policy-making, the distinction should not be experts versus amateurs, but insiders versus outsiders. Lippmann challenges the core assumption of Progressive politics as well as any theory that pretends to leave political decision making in the hands of the people as a whole.<br /><br />In his biography <em>Walter Lippmann and the American Century, </em>Ronald Steel praised <em>The Phantom Public </em>as \"one of Lippmann's most powerfully argued and revealing books. In it he came fully to terms with the inadequacy of traditional democratic theory.\" This volume is part of a continuing series on the major works of Walter Lippmann. As more and more Americans are inclined to become apathetic to the political system, this classic will be essential reading for students, teachers, and researchers of political science and history.",

    "description": "When it came to getting the two of us in trouble, Soup was a regular genius....Soup was my best pal. His real and righteous name was Luther Wesley Vinson, but nobody called him Luther. He didn't like it. I called him Luther just once, which promoted Soup to break me of a very bad habit before it really got formed. As soon as the swelling went out of my lip, I called him Soup instead of Thoop.Here are the stories of that friendship, and of the troubles--stories from a boyhood filled with barrels to roll in, apples to whip, windows to break, ropes to bind prisoners, acorn pepes, and ten-cent Saturday movies.<br /><br />But then as always nothing was quite as important as a best friend.",

    "description": "Cherrie Moraga, the celebrated Chicana lesbian writer, has crafted a jewel of a book in Waiting In The Wings: Portrait of a Queer Motherhood. This is the story of \"one small human being's struggle for survival\", the author's two-and-one-half pound premature baby boy.While the specifics belong to Moraga and her loved ones -- her large close-knit biological clan; her long-term partner; the child's father -- the tale is told in common with every woman who has experienced the wonder and terror of pregnancy, the trauma of a child's near-death. What is uncommon is that the mother is a lesbian, a writer, a Chicana -- all in the same breath of her storytelling.<br /><br />\"Lesbians don't make babies with our lovers\", she writes. \"Our blood doesn't mix\". What does mix in Waiting In The Wings are blood and queer relations, Mexican Catholicism and Indian ceremony, butch and femme, life and death -- creating the carne y huesos not only of a baby, but of a family. Familia the author holds to in the grip of labor, sister in one hand, lover in the other. Family whose history she sees written in the dried parchment that is a dying uncle's skin.<br /><br />\"I am trying to write about the impossible. The ordinary beginning and ending of a life\", Cherrie Moraga tells us. So ordinary, in fact, that perhaps Waiting In The Wings is not that \"queer\" after all.",

    "description": "\"<b>The Dive from Clausen's Pier</b> is one of those small miracles that reinforce our faith in fiction. It does what the best novels so often do, making the largest things visible by its perfect rendering of life on the smaller scale. It is witty, tragic and touching, and beguiling from the first page.\" --Scott Turow <br /><br />A riveting novel about loyalty and self-knowledge, and the conflict between who we want to be to others and who we must be for ourselves. <br /><br />Carrie Bell has lived in Wisconsin all her life. She\u2019s had the same best friend, the same good relationship with her mother, the same boyfriend, Mike, now her fianc\u00e9, for as long as anyone can remember. It\u2019s with real surprise she finds that, at age twenty-three, her life has begun to feel suffocating. She longs for a change, an upheaval, for a chance to begin again.<br /><br />That chance is granted to her, terribly, when Mike is injured in an accident. Now Carrie has to question everything she thought she knew about herself and the meaning of home. She must ask: How much do we owe the people we love? Is it a sign of strength or of weakness to walk away from someone in need?<br /><br /><i>The Dive from Clausen\u2019s Pier</i> reminds us how precarious our lives are and how quickly they can be divided into before and after, whether by random accident or by the force of our own desires. It begins with a disaster that could happen, out of the blue, in anybody\u2019s life, and it forces us to ask how we would bear up in the face of tragedy and what we know, or think we know, about our deepest allegiances. Elegantly written and ferociously paced, emotionally nuanced and morally complex,<i> The Dive from Clausen\u2019s Pier</i> marks the emergence of a prodigiously gifted new novelist.",

    "description": "From \"one of our most gifted writers\" <i>(Chicago Tribune),</i> here is a superb new novel that delicately unearths the myriad manifestations of extraordinary love between ordinary people.<br /><br /><b>The Feast of Love</b> is just that -- a sumptuous work of fiction about the thing that most distracts and delights us. In a re-imagined <i>Midsummer Night's Dream,</i> men and women speak of and desire their ideal mates; parents seek out their lost children; adult children try to come to terms with their own parents and, in some cases, find new ones.<br /><br />In vignettes both comic and sexy, the owner of a coffee shop recalls the day his first wife seemed to achieve a moment of simple perfection, while she remembers the women's softball game during which she was stricken by the beauty of the shortstop. A young couple spends hours at the coffee shop fueling the idea of their fierce love. A professor of philosophy, stopping by for a cup of coffee, makes a valiant attempt to explain what he knows to be the inexplicable workings of the human heart Their voices resonate with each other -- disparate people joined by the meanderings of love -- and come together in a tapestry that depicts the most irresistible arena of life. Crafted with subtlety, grace, and power, <b>The Feast of Love</b> is a masterful novel.",

    "description": "\"Do we still know how to read a novel?\" John Sutherland, Chairman of the 2005 Booker Prize Committee, asks. His answer is an unequivocal, \"No.\" But Sutherland has not given up hope. With acerbic wit and intellect, he traces the history of what it used to mean to be well-read and tells readers what it still means today while reminding readers how the delicate charms of fiction can be at once wonderful and inspired and infuriating. On one level this is a book about novels but at a deeper level, this is a book in which one of the most intimate t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates is described\u2014one in which a reader meets a novel. However, in order for the relationship to take its proper course, a reader must know <i>how</i> to read it! Sutherland helps readers:<br />--Pick the right book for them among the cattle call of pre-packaged blurbs and enticing cover art<br />--Recognize a misleading title at first glance<br />--Look beyond the politics of book reviewers<br />--Learn to read the extras\u2014epigraphs, forewords, afterwords\u2014to understand themes only hinted at in the main text<br />--Find real aspects of the author cleverly hidden in the narrative structure<br />--And much more <br />In a book that is as wry and humorous as it is learned and opinionated, John Sutherland tells you everything you always wanted to know about how to read fiction better than you do now (but, were afraid to ask).",

    "description": "With the publication of <b>On the Road</b> in 1957, Jack Kerouac became at once the spokesman and hero of the Beat Generation. Along with such visionaries as William S. Burroughs, Neal\u00a0Cassady,\u00a0and Allen Ginsberg, Kerouac changed the face of American literature, igniting a counterculture revolution that even now, decades later, burns brighter than ever in <b>Desolation Angels</b>.<br /><br />In one of the major cinematic events of 2012, Jack Kerouac's legendary Beat classic, <i>On the Road</i>, finally hits the big screen. Directed by Walter Salles (<i>The Motorcycle Diaries</i>; <i>Paris, Je T'Aime</i>) and with a cast of some of Hollywood's biggest young stars, including Kristen Stewart (The Twilight Saga), Sam Riley, Garrett\u00a0Hedlund, Kirsten Dunst, Amy Adams (<i>Julie &amp; Julia</i>, <i>The Fighter</i>), Tom Sturridge, and Viggo Mortensen (the Lord of the Rings trilogy, <i>The Road</i>), the film will attract new fans who will be inspired by Kerouac's revolutionary writing.",

    "description": "In New York and Baltimore, police cameras scan public areas twenty-four hours a day. Huge commercial databases track your finances and sell that information to anyone willing to pay. Host sites on the World Wide Web record every page you view, and \u201csmart\u201d toll roads know where you drive. Every day, new technology nibbles at our privacy. Does that make you nervous?<br /><br />David Brin is worried, but not just about privacy. He fears that society will overreact to these technologies by restricting the flow of information, frantically enforcing a reign of secrecy. Such measures, he warns, won\u2019t really preserve our privacy. Governments, the wealthy, criminals, and the techno-elite will still find ways to watch us. But we\u2019ll have fewer ways to watch them. We\u2019ll lose the key to a free society: accountability.<br /><br /><i>The Transparent Society</i> is a call for \u201creciprocal transparency.\u201d If police cameras watch us, shouldn\u2019t we be able to watch police stations? If credit bureaus sell our data, shouldn't we know who buys it? Rather than cling to an illusion of anonymity - a historical anomaly, given our origins in close-knit villages - we should focus on guarding the most important forms of privacy and preserving mutual accountability. The biggest threat to our freedom, Brin warns, is that surveillance technology will be used by too few people, now by too many.<br /><br />A society of glass houses may seem too fragile. Fearing technology-aided crime, governments seek to restrict online anonymity; fearing technology-aided tyranny, citizens call for encrypting all data. Brins shows how, contrary to both approaches, windows offer us much better protection than walls; after all, the strongest deterrent against snooping has always been the fear of being spotted. Furthermore, Brin argues, Western culture now encourages eccentricity - we\u2019re programmed to rebel! That gives our society a natural protection against error and wrong-doing, like a body\u2019s immune system. But \u201csocial T-cells\u201d need openness to spot trouble and get the word out.<br /><br /><i>The Transparent Society</i> is full of such provocative and far-reaching analysis. The inescapable rush of technology is forcing us to make new choices about how we want to live. This daring book reminds us that an open society is more robust and flexible than one where secrecy reigns. In an era of gnat-sized cameras, universal databases, and clothes-penetrating radar, it will be more vital than ever for us to be able to watch the watchers. With reciprocal transparency we can detect dangers early and expose wrong-doers. We can gauge the credibility of pundits and politicians. We can share technological advances and news. But all of these benefits depend on the free, two-way flow of information.",

    "description": "<b>In <i>Euclid's Window</i>, Leonard Mlondinow takes us on a brilliantly entertaining journey through 3,000 years of genius and geometry, introducing the people who revolutionized the way we see the world around us.</b><br /><br />Ever since Pythagoras hatched a 'little scheme' to invent a set of rules describing the entire universe, scientists and mathematicians have tried to seek order in the cosmos: Euclid, who in 300BC defined the nature of space; Descartes, a fourteenth-century gambler and idler who invented the graph; Gauss, the fifteen-year-old genius who discovered that space is curved; Einstein, who added time to the equation; and Witten, who ushered in today's weird new world of extra, twisted dimensions.<br /><br />They all show how geometry is the key to understanding the universe. Once you have viewed life through <i>Euclid's Window</i>, it will never be the same again...<br /><br />'Elegant, attractive and concise ... also very readable. Buy it'<br />\u00a0\u00a0Ian Stewart, <i>New Scientist</i><br /><br /><br /><br /> 'This is an exhilarating book ... an important book ... and finally, a lovely book, one that reflects the radiance of its subject'<br />\u00a0\u00a0David Berlinski<br /><br />'Reader-friendly, high-spirited, splendidly lucid and often hilarious'<br />\u00a0\u00a0<i>Washington Post</i><br /><br />'Mlodinow has a talent for lively and clear exposition ... Pythagoras' proof has lost none of its capacity to astonish and delight' <br />\u00a0\u00a0Edward Skidelsky, <i>Daily Telegraph</i><br /><br /><b>Leonard Mlodinow</b> was a member of the faculty of the Californian Institute of Technology before moving to Hollywood to become a writer for television. He has developed many best selling and award-winning CD-ROMs and is currently Vice President, Emerging Technologies and R&amp;D at Scholastic Inc. He lives in New York City. His other books include <i>The Drunkard's Walk </i>and <i>Subliminal</i>.",

    "description": "In this newly revised edition of the bestselling classic The Hero Within, Carol S. Pearson gives us a unique vocabulary to explore the link between ancient archetypes and our contemporary lives.<p>Works like Joseph Campbell's The Hero With a Thousand Faces have introduced readers to the significance of myth and archetype in our lives. Carol Pearson's bestselling The Hero Within takes us further by combining literature, anthropology, and psychology to clearly define, with insight and understanding, the six heroic archetypes that exist in all of us: the Innocent, the Orphan, the Wanderer, the Warrior, the Martyr, and the Magician. This substantially revised edition features new chapters that illuminate these archetypes, showing how to reach our fullest potential by achieving a balance between work, family, and the self.</p><p>\"An excellent and useful book about the course our psychological and development can take.... {Pearson's} is an evolutionary archetypal psychology\". -- Jean Shinoda Bolen, M.D., author of Goddess in Everywoman and Gods in Everyman</p>",

    "description": "\"Women in Love\" was written in the years before and during World War I. Criticized for its exploration of human sexuality, the novel is filled with symbolism and poetry -- and is compulsively entertaining.The story opens with sisters Ursula and Gudrun Brangwen, characters who also appeared in \"The Rainbow,\" discussing marriage, then walking through a haunting landscape ruined by coal mines, smoking factories, and sooty dwellings. Soon Gudrun will choose Gerald, the icily handsome mining industrialist, as her lover; Ursula will become involved with Birkin, a school inspector -- and an erotic interweaving of souls and bodies begins. One couple will find love, the other death, in Lawrence's lush, powerfully crafted fifth novel, one of his masterpieces and the work that may best convey his beliefs about sex, love, and humankind's ongoing struggle between the forces of destruction and life.",

    "description": "\"<b>Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid....He is the hero; he is everything. He must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man. </b><br /><br />This is the Code of the Private Eye as defined by Raymond Chandler in his 1944 essay 'The Simple Act of Murder.' Such a man was Philip Marlowe, private eye, an educated, heroic, streetwise, rugged individualist and the hero of Chandler's first novel, <i>The Big Sleep</i>. This work established Chandler as the master of the 'hard-boiled' detective novel, and his articulate and literary style of writing won him a large audience, which ranged from the man in the street to the most sophisticated intellectual. <br /><br />Marlowe subsequently appeared in a series of extremely popular novels, among them <i>The Lady in the Lake</i>, <i>The Long Goodbye</i>, and <i>Farewell, My Lovely</i>.\" ~ Elizabeth Diefendorf, editor, <i>The New York Public Library's Books of the Century</i>, p. 112.<br /><br />Selected as one of Time Magazine's All-Time 100 Novels, with the following review: \"'I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn't care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be.' This sentence, from the first paragraph of The Big Sleep, marks the last time you can be fully confident that you know what's going on. <br /><br />The first novel by Raymond Chandler at the age of 51.",

    "description": "\"My satire is against those who see figures and averages, and nothing else,\" proclaimed Charles Dickens in explaining the theme of this classic novel. Published in 1854, the story concerns one Thomas Gradgrind, a \"fanatic of the demonstrable fact,\" who raises his children, Tom and Louisa, in a stifling and arid atmosphere of grim practicality.<br /><br />Without a moral compass to guide them, the children sink into lives of desperation and despair, played out against the grim background of Coketown, a wretched community shadowed by an industrial behemoth. Louisa falls into a loveless marriage with Josiah Bouderby, a vulgar banker, while the unscrupulous Tom, totally lacking in principle, becomes a thief who frames an innocent man for his crime. Witnessing the degradation and downfall of his children, Gradgrind realizes that his own misguided principles have ruined their lives.<br /><br />Considered Dickens' harshest indictment of mid-19th-century industrial practices and their dehumanizing effects, this novel offers a fascinating tapestry of Victorian life, filled with the richness of detail, brilliant characterization, and passionate social concern that typify the novelist's finest creations.<br /><br />Of Dickens' work, the eminent Victorian critic John Ruskin had this to say: \"He is entirely right in his main drift and purpose in every book he has written; and all of them, but especially Hard Times, should be studied with close and earnest care by persons interested in social questions.\"",

    "description": "In this groundbreaking book, the renowned theoretical physicist Lee Smolin argues that physics \u2014 the basis for all other sciences \u2014 has lost its way. For more than two centuries, our understanding of the laws of nature expanded rapidly. But today, despite our best efforts, we know nothing more about these laws than we knew in the 1970s. Why is physics suddenly in trouble? And what can we do about it?<br /><br />One of the major problems, according to Smolin, is string theory: an ambitious attempt to formulate a \u201ctheory of everything\u201d that explains all the particles and forces of nature and how the universe came to be. With its exotic new particles and parallel universes, string theory has captured the public\u2019s imagination and seduced many physicists.<br /><br />But as Smolin reveals, there\u2019s a deep flaw in the theory: no part of it has been tested, and no one knows how to test it. In fact, the theory appears to come in an infinite number of versions, meaning that no experiment will ever be able to prove it false. As a scientific theory, it fails. And because it has soaked up the lion\u2019s share of funding, attracted some of the best minds, and effectively penalized young physicists for pursuing other avenues, it is dragging the rest of physics down with it.<br /><br />With clarity, passion, and authority, Smolin charts the rise and fall of string theory and takes a fascinating look at what will replace it. A group of young theorists has begun to develop exciting ideas that, unlike string theory, are testable. Smolin not only tells us who and what to watch for in the coming years, he offers novel solutions for seeking out and nurturing the best new talent\u2014giving us a chance, at long last, of finding the next Einstein.",

    "description": "Henri Poincar\u00e9 was one of the greatest mathematicians of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. He revolutionized the field of topology, which studies properties of geometric configurations that are unchanged by stretching or twisting. The Poincar\u00e9 conjecture lies at the heart of modern geometry and topology, and even pertains to the possible shape of the universe. The conjecture states that there is only one shape possible for a finite universe in which every loop can be contracted to a single point.<br /><br />Poincar\u00e9's conjecture is one of the seven \"millennium problems\" that bring a one-million-dollar award for a solution. Grigory Perelman, a Russian mathematician, has offered a proof that is likely to win the Fields Medal, the mathematical equivalent of a Nobel prize, in August 2006. He also will almost certainly share a Clay Institute millennium award.<br /><br />In telling the vibrant story of <i>The Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture</i>, Donal O'Shea makes accessible to general readers for the first time the meaning of the conjecture, and brings alive the field of mathematics and the achievements of generations of mathematicians whose work have led to Perelman's proof of this famous conjecture.",

    "description": "Nicolas Bourbaki, whose mathematical publications began to appear in the late 1930s and continued to be published through most of the twentieth century, was a direct product as well as a major force behind an important revolution that took place in the early decades of the twentieth century that completely changed Western culture. Pure mathematics, the area of Bourbaki's work, seems on the surface to be an abstract field of human study with no direct connection with the real world. In reality, however, it is closely intertwined with the general culture that surrounds it. Major developments in mathematics have often followed important trends in popular culture; developments in mathematics have acted as harbingers of change in the surrounding human culture. The seeds of change, the beginnings of the revolution that swept the Western world in the early decades of the twentieth century \u2014 both in mathematics and in other areas \u2014 were sown late in the previous century. This is the story both of Bourbaki and the world that created him in that time. It is the story of an elaborate intellectual joke \u2014 because Bourbaki, one of the foremost mathematicians of his day \u2014 never existed.",

With her father dead and her incompetent half-brother on the throne, the kingdom is in danger of falling to the warring Firelanders. <br /><br />Before she was old enough for a marriage-of-alliance, Xylara was trained as a healer.

She learns their language and their customs and tries to make them as comfortable as possible, despite their prisoner-of-war status.<br /><br />She never expects that these deeds, done in good faith, would lead to the handsome and mysterious Firelander Warlord demanding her in exchange for a cease-fire.

Now the Warlord and his chosen mate face enemies within the tribe and danger lurks on every hand as they journey toward Keir's homeland. <br /><br />When they reach a village marked with the warnings of the plague, Keir forbids Lara to heal the sick, commanding that she not risk her own life. But both Lara and Kier are strong of will and neither will bend easily, even for love; and when Lara disobeys, she pays the price: both she and Kier are plague-struck... and so is their entire encampment.<br /><br />In the midst of the dying, Iften, a rival warrior, gathers his followers and challenges Keir for the right to rule their tribe. If Keir, weakened by the sickness, loses -- he dies. <br /><br />And so does Lara.<br /><br />To save her love, her life, and her adopted people, Lara must find a cure for the plague -- and fully embrace her sworn role as Warprize to her Warlord.<br />",

Not allowed to stay home alone, yet old enough to watch pesky Willa Jean, Ramona wonders when her mother will treat her like her older, more mature sister, Beezus.<br /><br />But with her parents' unsettling quarrels and some spelling trouble at school, Ramona wonders if growing up is all it's cracked up to be. No matter what, she'll always be her mother's little girl\u2026right? This warm-hearted story of a mother's love for her spirited young daughter is told beautifully by Newbery Medal winning author Beverly Cleary.",

    "description": "A true story from award-winning journalist Sonia Nazario recounting the odyssey of a Honduran boy who braves hardship and peril to reach his mother in the United States.<br /><br />In this astonishing true story, award-winning journalist Sonia Nazario recounts the unforgettable odyssey of a Honduran boy who braves unimaginable hardship and peril to reach his mother in the United States. <br /><br />When Enrique is five years old, his mother, Lourdes, too poor to feed her children, leaves Honduras to work in the United States. The move allows her to send money back home to Enrique so he can eat better and go to school past the third grade.<br /><br />Lourdes promises Enrique she will return quickly. But she struggles in America. Years pass. He begs for his mother to come back. Without her, he becomes lonely and troubled. When she calls, Lourdes tells him to be patient. Enrique despairs of ever seeing her again. After eleven years apart, he decides he will go find her.<br /><br />Enrique sets off alone from Tegucigalpa, with little more than a slip of paper bearing his mother's North Carolina telephone number. Without money, he will make the dangerous and illegal trek up the length of Mexico the only way he can \u2013 clinging to the sides and tops of freight trains.<br /><br />With gritty determination and a deep longing to be by his mother's side, Enrique travels through hostile, unknown worlds. Each step of the way through Mexico, he and other migrants, many of them children, are hunted like animals. Gangsters control the tops of the trains. Bandits rob and kill migrants up and down the tracks. Corrupt cops all along the route are out to fleece and deport them. To evade Mexican police and immigration authorities, they must jump onto and off the moving boxcars they call El Tren de la Muerte- The Train of Death. Enrique pushes forward using his wit, courage, and hope - and the kindness of strangers. It is an epic journey, one thousands of immigrant children make each year to find their mothers in the United States.<br /><br />Based on the Los Angeles Times newspaper series that won two Pulitzer Prizes, one for feature writing and another for feature photography, Enrique's Journey is the timeless story of families torn apart, the yearning to be together again, and a boy who will risk his life to find the mother he loves.",

Through sloppy usage and low standards on the Internet, in e-mail, and now text messages, we have made proper punctuation an endangered species. </p><p> In <i>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves</i>, former editor Truss dares to say, in her delightfully urbane, witty, and very English way, that it is time to look at our commas and semicolons and see them as the wonderful and necessary things they are. This is a book for people who love punctuation and get upset when it is mishandled. From the invention of the question mark in the time of Charlemagne to George Orwell shunning the semicolon, this lively history makes a powerful case for the preservation of a system of printing conventions that is much too subtle to be mucked about with.</p>",

    "description": "As the Western world struggles to comprehend the paradoxes of modern Turkey, a country both European and Asian, forward-looking yet rooted in ancient empire, <i>Tales from the Expat Harem</i> reveals its most personal nuances. This illuminating anthology provides a window into the country from the perspective of thirty-two expatriates from seven different nations - artists, entrepreneurs, Peace Corps volunteers, archaeologists, missionaries, and others - who established lives in Turkey for work, love, or adventure. Through narrative essays covering the last four decades, these diverse women unveil the mystique of the \"Orient,\" describe religious conflict, embrace cultural discovery, and maneuver familial traditions, customs, and responsibilities. Poignant, humorous, and transcendent, the essays take readers to weddings and workplaces, down cobbled Byzantine streets, into boisterous bazaars along the Silk Road, and deep into the feminine stronghold of steamy Ottoman bathhouses. The outcome is a stunning collection of voices from women suspended between two homes as they redefine their identities and reshape their worldviews.Coining the \"expat harem\" as a distinct community, the editors also boldly reclaim the concept of an Eastern harem-long the subject of erroneous Western stereotype. \"Much like the imported brides of fifteenth-century sultans, our expat harem is conjured by the shared circumstance of being foreign-born and female in a land laced with a harem tradition,\" Ashman and Gokmen declare.\"Our writers are inextricably wedded to Turkish culture, embedded in it, yet alien nonetheless.\"",
