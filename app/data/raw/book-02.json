Robots have descended on us from outer space, escaped from top-secret laboratories, and even traveled back in time to destroy us.<br /><br />Today, scientists are working hard to bring these artificial creations to life. In Japan, fuzzy little real robots are delivering much appreciated hug therapy to the elderly. Children are frolicking with smiling robot toys.<br /><br />It all seems so innocuous. And yet how could so many Hollywood scripts be wrong?<br /><br />So take no chances. Arm yourself with expert knowledge. For the sake of humanity, listen to serious advice from real robotics experts. How else will you survive the inevitable future in which robots rebel against their human masters?",

    "description": "<b>From one of the most beloved and bestselling authors in the English language, a vivid, nostalgic, and utterly hilarious memoir of growing up in the 1950s<br /></b><br />Bill Bryson was born in the middle of the American century\u20141951\u2014in the middle of the United States\u2014Des Moines, Iowa\u2014in the middle of the largest generation in American history\u2014the baby boomers. As one of the best and funniest writers alive, he is perfectly positioned to mine his memories of a totally all-American childhood for 24-carat memoir gold. Like millions of his generational peers, Bill Bryson grew up with a rich fantasy life as a superhero. In his case, he ran around his house and neighborhood with an old football jersey with a thunderbolt on it and a towel about his neck that served as his cape, leaping tall buildings in a single bound and vanquishing awful evildoers (and morons)\u2014in his head\u2014as \"The Thunderbolt Kid.\" <br /><br />Using this persona as a springboard, Bill Bryson re-creates the life of his family and his native city in the 1950s in all its transcendent normality\u2014a life at once completely familiar to us all and as far away and unreachable as another galaxy. It was, he reminds us, a happy time, when automobiles and televisions and appliances (not to mention nuclear weapons) grew larger and more numerous with each passing year, and DDT, cigarettes, and the fallout from atmospheric testing were considered harmless or even good for you. He brings us into the life of his loving but eccentric family, including affectionate portraits of his father, a gifted sportswriter for the local paper and dedicated practitioner of isometric exercises, and OF his mother, whose job as the home furnishing editor for the same paper left her little time for practicing the domestic arts at home. The many readers of Bill Bryson\u2019s earlier classic, <i>A Walk in the Woods,</i> will greet the reappearance in these pages of the immortal Stephen Katz, seen hijacking literally boxcar loads of beer. He is joined in the Bryson gallery of immortal characters by the demonically clever Willoughby brothers, who apply their scientific skills and can-do attitude to gleefully destructive ends. <br /><br />Warm and laugh-out-loud funny, and full of his inimitable, pitch-perfect observations, <i>The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid</i> is as wondrous a book as Bill Bryson has ever written. It will enchant anyone who has ever been young.",

Annie Hart is a \"relationship expert\" who is wanted for armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. Stephanie needs to find her, fast. Diesel knows where she is. So they make a deal: He'll help her get Annie if Stephanie plays matchmaker to several of Annie's most difficult clients. But someone wants to find Annie even more than Diesel and Stephanie. Someone with a nasty temper. And someone with \"unmentionable\" skills. Does Diesel know more than he's saying about Annie Hart? Does Diesel have secrets he's keeping from Stephanie and the two men in her life--Ranger and Morelli? With Stephanie Plum in over her head, things are sure to get a little dicey and a little explosive, Jersey style!",

In Stephanie's opinion, toxic waste, rabid drivers, armed schizophrenics, and August heat, humidity, and hydrocarbons are all part of the great adventure of living in Jersey. She's a product of blue-collar Trenton, where houses are attached and narrow, cars are American, windows are clean, and dinner is served at six.\n    \n    Out of work and out of money, with her Miata repossessed and her refrigerator empty, Stephanie blackmails her bail bondsman cousin, Vinnie, into giving her a try as an apprehension agent. And that\u2019s only the beginning of series that will set her on the trail of fugitives. Stephanie will have to sharpen her sleuthing skills, because she's got many a mystery to solve. \n    \n    See also the related <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/43440-a-stephanie-plum-between-the-numbers-holiday-novel\">Between the Numbers Holiday novels</a> and the spinoff <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/49600-the-unmentionables\">Lizzy & Diesel</a> series.\n    \n    Please note: Each book in this series is a whole story with a beginning and an ending, however there may be minor references to events that occurred earlier in the series. Therefore, with respect to the mystery alone, the books can be read out of order, if desired. However, like any long series that focuses on a core group of characters, there are various relationship changes that develop more naturally when the full length novels are read in the order in which they were published.\n    \n    http://us.macmillan.com/series/StephaniePlumNovels",

    "description": "In a memoir hailed for its searing candor and wit, Alice Sebold reveals how her life was utterly transformed when, as an eighteen-year-old college freshman, she was brutally raped and beaten in a park near campus. What propels this chronicle of her recovery is Sebold's indomitable spirit - as she struggles for understanding (\"After telling the hard facts to anyone, from lover to friend, I have changed in their eyes\"); as her dazed family and friends sometimes bungle their efforts to provide comfort and support; and as, ultimately, she triumphs, managing through grit and coincidence to help secure her attacker's arrest and conviction. In a narrative by turns disturbing, thrilling, and inspiring, Alice Sebold illuminates the experience of trauma victims even as she imparts wisdom profoundly hard-won: \"You save yourself or you remain unsaved.\"",

    "description": "In 1995, Marie Gesto disappeared after walking out of a supermarket in Hollywood. Harry Bosch worked the case but couldn't crack it, and the 22-year-old woman never turned up, dead or alive. Now Bosch is in the Open-Unsolved Unit, where he still keeps the Gesto file on his desk, when he gets a call from the DA. A man accused of two heinous killings is willing to come clean about several other murders, including the killing of Marie Gesto. Bosch must now take Raynard Waits's confession and get close to the man he has sought - and hated - for eleven years. But when Bosch learns that he and his partner missed a clue back in 1995 that could have led them to Gesto's killer - and that would have stopped nine murders that followed - he begins to crack.<br />Michael Connelly's suspenseful new novel pits the detective People magazine calls \"one of the most complex crime fighters around\" against one of the most sadistic killers he has ever confronted. It confirms that Michael Connelly \"is the best writer of suspense fiction working today\" (Richmond Times-Dispatch).",

It is also the introduction of a bold and talented literary voice. <br />Before considering reading this book, please see the BookBrowse note on the book jacket/review page.<br /><br />BookBrowse Note: January 9th 2006: An article in the Smoking Gun claimed that James Frey (author of A Million Little Pieces and My Friend Leonard) fabricated key parts of his books. They cited police records, court documents and interviews with law enforcement agents which belie a number of Frey's claims regarding criminal charges against him, jail terms and his fugitive status.<br /><br />In an interview with the Smoking Gun, Frey admitted that he had 'embellished central details' in A Million Little Pieces and backtracked on claims he made in the book.<br /><br />January 26th 2006. Frey's publisher stated that while it initially stood by him, after further questioning of the author, the house has \"sadly come to the realization that a number of facts have been altered and incidents embellished.\" It will be adding a a publisher's note and author's note to all future editions of A Million Little Pieces.",

As Sarah Erdman enters the social fold of the village as a Peace Corps volunteer, she finds that Nambonkaha is also a place where AIDS threatens and poverty is constant, where women suffer the indignities of patriarchal customs, and where children work like adults while still managing to dream. Lyrical and topical, Erdman's beautiful debut captures the astonishing spirit of an unforgettable community.<br /></div>",

    "description": "(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed)<br /><br />A gripping vision of our society radically overturned by a theocratic revolution, Margaret Atwood\u2019s <i>The Handmaid's Tale </i>has become one of the most powerful and most widely read novels of our time.<br /><br />Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead, serving in the household of the enigmatic Commander and his bitter wife. She may go out once a day to markets whose signs are now pictures because women are not allowed to read. She must pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, for in a time of declining birthrates her value lies in her fertility, and failure means exile to the dangerously polluted Colonies. Offred can remember a time when she lived with her husband and daughter and had a job, before she lost even her own name. Now she navigates the intimate secrets of those who control her every move, risking her life in breaking the rules. <br /><br />Like Aldous Huxley\u2019s <i>Brave New World </i>and George Orwell\u2019s <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four, The Handmaid's Tale </i>has endured not only as a literary landmark but as a warning of a possible future that is still chillingly relevant.",

In her groundbreaking book, <em>New York</em> magazine writer Ariel Levy argues that, if male chauvinist pigs of years past thought of women as pieces of meat, Female Chauvinist Pigs of today are doing them one better, making sex objects of other women \u2013 and of themselves. Irresistibly witty and wickedly intelligent, <em>Female Chauvinist Pigs</em> makes the case that the rise of raunch does not represent how far women have come; it only proves how far they have left to go.",

    "description": "With the clarity, insight, and sheer exuberance of language that make her one of <i>The New York Times</i>'s premier stylists, Pulitzer Prize-winner Natalie Angier lifts the veil of secrecy from that most enigmatic of evolutionary masterpieces, the female body. Angier takes readers on a mesmerizing tour of female anatomy and physiology that explores everything from organs to orgasm, and delves into topics such as exercise, menopause, and the mysterious properties of breast milk.<br /><br />A self-proclaimed \"scientific fantasia of womanhood.\" <b>Woman</b> ultimately challenges widely accepted Darwinian-based gender stereotypes. Angier shows how cultural biases have influenced research in evolutionary psychology (the study of the biological bases of behavior) and consequently lead to dubious conclusions about \"female nature.\" such as the idea that women are innately monogamous while men are natural philanderers.<br /><br />But Angier doesn't just point fingers; she offers optimistic alternatives and transcends feminist polemics with an enlightened subversiveness that makes for a joyful, fresh vision of womanhood. <b>Woman</b> is a seminal work that will endure as an essential read for anyone intersted in how biology affects who we are as women, as men, and as human beings.",

    "description": "Mary Brave Bird grew up fatherless in a one-room cabin, without running water or electricity, on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Rebelling against the aimless drinking, punishing missionary school, narrow strictures for women, and violence and hopeless of reservation life, she joined the new movement of tribal pride sweeping Native American communities in the sixties and seventies. Mary eventually married Leonard Crow Dog, the American Indian Movement's chief medicine man, who revived the sacred but outlawed Ghost Dance.<br /><br />Originally published in 1990, <i>Lakota Woman</i> was a national best seller and winner of the American Book Award. It is a unique document, unparalleled in American Indian literature, a story of death, of determination against all odds, of the cruelties perpetuated against American Indians, and of the Native American struggle for rights. Working with Richard Erdoes, one of the twentieth century's leading writers on Native American affairs, Brave Bird recounts her difficult upbringing and the path of her fascinating life.",

    "description": "The four-million-copy international bestseller of the incredible love story between a European woman and an African warrior.<br /><br /><i>The White Masai</i> combines adventure and the pursuit of passion in a page-turning story of two star-crossed lovers from vastly different backgrounds. Corinne, a European entrepreneur, meets Lketinga, a Samburu warrior, while on vacation in Mombasa on Kenya's glamorous coast. Despite language and cultural barriers, they embark on an impossible love affair. Corinne uproots her life to move to Africa\u2014not the romantic Africa of popular culture, but the Africa of the Masai, in the middle of the isolated bush, where five-foot-tall huts made from cow dung serve as homes. Undaunted by wild animals, hunger, and bouts with tropical diseases, she tries to forge a life with Lketinga. But slowly the dream starts to crumble when she can no longer ignore the chasm between their two vastly different cultures.<br /><br />A story that taps into our universal belief in the power of love, <i>The White Masai</i> is at once a hopelessly romantic love story, a gripping adventure yarn, and a compulsively good read.",

    "description": "A <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> NOTABLE BOOK OF THE YEAR<br /><br />The classic account of the hurdles facing adolescent girls in America--now reissued with a new Foreword, to coincide with the award-winning author's new book on women and identity.<br /><br />Inspired by a study by the American Association of University Women that showed girls' self-esteem plummeting as they reach adolescence, Peggy Orenstein spent months observing, interviewing, and getting know dozens of girls both inside and outside the classroom at two very different schools in northern California. The result was a groundbreaking book in which she brought the disturbing statistics to life with skill and flair of an experienced journalist. <br /><br />Orenstein plumbs the minds of both boys and girls who have learned to equate masculinity with opportunity and assertiveness, and femininity with reserve and restraint. She demonstrates the cost of this insidious lesson, by taking us into the lives of real young women who are struggling with eating disorders, sexual harassment, and declining academic achievement, especially in math and science. Peggy Orenstein's <b>SchoolGirls</b> is a classic that belongs on the shelf with the work of Carol Gilligan, Joan Jacobs Brumberg, and Mary Pipher. It continues to be read by all who care about how our schools and our society teach girls to shortchange themselves.",

    "description": "Like The Catcher in the Rye or The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Botchan, a hilarious tale about a young man's rebellion against \"the system\" in a country school, is a classic of its kind. Among Japanese readers both young and old it has enjoyed a timeless popularity, making it, according to Donald Keene, <i>\"probably the most widely read novel in modern Japan.\"</i><br /><br />The setting is Japan's deep south, where the author himself spent some time teaching English in a boys' school. Into this conservative world, with its social proprieties and established pecking order, breezes Botchan, down from the big city, with scant respect for either his elders or his noisy young charges; and the result is a chain of collisions large and small.<br /><br />Much of the story seems to occur in summer, against the drone of cicadas, and in many ways this is a summer book light, funny, never slow-moving. Here, in a lively new translation much better suited to Western tastes than any of its forebears, Botchan's homespun appeal is all the more apparent, and even those who have never been near the sunlit island on which these calamitous episodes take place should find in it uninterrupted entertainment.",

Set in the early 1950s, in an India newly independent and struggling through a time of crisis, <i>A Suitable Boy</i> takes us into the richly imagined world of four large extended families and spins a compulsively readable tale of their lives and loves. A sweeping panoramic portrait of a complex, multiethnic society in flux, <i>A Suitable Boy</i> remains the story of ordinary people caught up in a web of love and ambition, humor and sadness, prejudice and reconciliation, the most delicate social etiquette and the most appalling violence.",

This magnificent book shows how radical change can be fostered in situations that seem insurmountable, and it also shows how a meaningful life can be created, as Farmer\u2014brilliant, charismatic, charming, both a leader in international health and a doctor who finds time to make house calls in Boston and the mountains of Haiti\u2014blasts through convention to get results.<br /><br /><i>Mountains Beyond Mountains</i> takes us from Harvard to Haiti, Peru, Cuba, and Russia as Farmer changes minds and practices through his dedication to the philosophy that \"the only real nation is humanity\"\u2014a philosophy that is embodied in the small public charity he founded, Partners in Health. He enlists the help of the Gates Foundation, George Soros, the U.N.\u2019s World Health Organization, and others in his quest to cure the world. At the heart of this book is the example of a life based on hope, and on an understanding of the truth of the Haitian proverb \"Beyond mountains there are mountains\": as you solve one problem, another problem presents itself, and so you go on and try to solve that one too.<br /><br />\"<i>Mountains Beyond Mountains</i> unfolds with the force of a gathering revelation,\" says Annie Dillard, and Jonathan Harr says, \"[Farmer] wants to change the world. Certainly this luminous and powerful book will change the way you see it.\"",

Through those letters, she enrolls in a kind of correspondence course, covering Socrates to Sartre, with a mysterious philosopher, while receiving letters addressed to another girl. Who is Hilde? And why does her mail keep turning up? To unravel this riddle, Sophie must use the philosophy she is learning--but the truth turns out to be far more complicated than she could have imagined.",

As the ringmaster bends over her, he notices an amulet of amber around her neck, the same trinket he had given his own lost child, who was swept away in a torrent some sixteen years earlier.<br /><br />This tale is narrated by Petter, a precocious child and fantasist, and perhaps Jostein Gaarder's most intriguing character since Sophie. As an adult, Petter makes his living selling stories and ideas to professionals suffering from writer's block. But as Petter sits spinning his tales, he finds himself in a trap of his own making.",

Piya Roy, a young American marine biologist of Indian descent, arrives in this lush, treacherous landscape in search of a rare species of river dolphin and enlists the aid of a local fisherman and a translator. Together the three of them launch into the elaborate backwaters, drawn unawares into the powerful political undercurrents of this isolated corner of the world that exact a personal toll as fierce as the tides.",

    "description": "Alessandra Cecchi is not quite fifteen when her father, a prosperous cloth merchant, brings a young painter back from northern Europe to decorate the chapel walls in the family\u2019s Florentine palazzo. A child of the Renaissance, with a precocious mind and a talent for drawing, Alessandra is intoxicated by the painter\u2019s abilities.<br /><br />But their burgeoning relationship is interrupted when Alessandra\u2019s parents arrange her marriage to a wealthy, much older man. Meanwhile, Florence is changing, increasingly subject to the growing suppression imposed by the fundamentalist monk Savonarola, who is seizing religious and political control. Alessandra and her native city are caught between the Medici state, with its love of luxury, learning, and dazzling art, and the hellfire preaching and increasing violence of Savonarola\u2019s reactionary followers. Played out against this turbulent backdrop, Alessandra\u2019s married life is a misery, except for the surprising freedom it allows her to pursue her powerful attraction to the young painter and his art. <br /><br /><i>The Birth of Venus</i> is a tour de force, the first historical novel from one of Britain\u2019s most innovative writers of literary suspense. It brings alive the history of Florence at its most dramatic period, telling a compulsively absorbing story of love, art, religion, and power through the passionate voice of Alessandra, a heroine with the same vibrancy of spirit as her beloved city.",

But for readers who have asked for a more accessible formulation of its key concepts\u2014the nature of space and time, the role of God in creation, and the history and future of the universe\u2014<i>A Briefer History of Time</i> is Professor Hawking\u2019s response.<br /> \u00a0<br /> Although \u201cbriefer,\u201d this book is much more than a mere explanation of Hawking\u2019s earlier work. <i>A Briefer History of Time</i> both clarifies and expands on the great subjects of the original, and records the latest developments in the field\u2014from string theory to the search for a unified theory of all the forces of physics. Thirty-seven full-color illustrations enhance the text and make <i>A Briefer History of Time</i> an exhilarating and must-have addition in its own right to the great literature of science and ideas.",

    "description": "Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts is full of new dangers. A convicted murderer, Sirius Black, has broken out of Azkaban prison, and it seems he's after Harry. Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny and poignant third installment of the beloved series.<br />--scholastic.com",

    "description": "Palast is astonishing, he gets the real evidence no one else has the guts to dig up.\" Vincent Bugliosi, author of None Dare Call it Treason and Helter Skelter <br />Award-winning investigative journalist Greg Palast digs deep to unearth the ugly facts that few reporters working anywhere in the world today have the courage or ability to cover. From East Timor to Waco, he has exposed some of the most egregious cases of political corruption, corporate fraud, and financial manipulation in the US and abroad. His uncanny investigative skills as well as his no-holds-barred style have made him an anathema among magnates on four continents and a living legend among his colleagues and his devoted readership. <br />This excitingcollection, now revised and updated, brings together some of Palast's most powerful writing of the past decade. Included here are his celebrated Washington Post expose on Jeb Bush and Katherine Harris's stealing of the presidential election in Florida, and recent stories on George W. Bush's payoffs to corporate cronies, the payola behind Hillary Clinton, and the faux energy crisis. Also included in this volume are new and previously unpublished material, television transcripts, photographs, and letters.",

L'intera esistenza \u00e8 sogno, caratterizzata quindi da illusoriet\u00e0, fugacit\u00e0 del tempo, vanit\u00e0 delle cose terrene. L'unica realt\u00e0 possibile \u00e8 la morte, che svela all'uomo la vera natura dell'esistenza, cio\u00e8 l'illusoriet\u00e0, e quindi l'inconsistenza del mondo. Per queste idee l'opera teatrale \u00e8 emblematica del clima culturale dell'et\u00e0 barocca ed \u00e8 un'opera fondamentale della letteratura barocca europea.<br />\u00a0<br />Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca (Madrid, 17 gennaio 1600 \u2013 Madrid, 25 maggio 1681) \u00e8 stato un drammaturgo e religioso spagnolo.\u00c8 considerato l'ultima grande voce del Siglo de oro spagnolo.<br /><br />Traduzione di Giovanni La Cecilia",

As a young, na\u00efve correspondent for <i>The Stars and Stripes</i>, Rooney flew bomber missions, arrived in France during the D-Day invasion, crossed the Rhine with the Allied forces, traveled to Paris for the Liberation, and was one of the first reporters into Buchenwald. Like so many of his generation, Rooney's life was changed forever by the war. He saw life at the extremes of human experience, and wrote about what he observed, making it real to millions of men and women. <i>My War</i> is the story of an inexperienced kid learning the craft of journalism. It is by turns moving, suspenseful, and reflective. And Rooney's unmistakable voice shines through on every page.",

Constituye la exaltacion con tintes epicos de la figura del gaucho, rebelde y pendenciero, payador y proscrito, verdadero centro de este tipo de literatura popular que reclamaba su independencia de modelos a traves de ahondar en el folclore autoctono de la Pampa.",

    "description": "Newspaperman, short-story writer, poet, and satirist, Ambrose Bierce (1842\u20131914) is one of the most striking and unusual literary figures America has produced. Dubbed \"Bitter Bierce\" for his vitriolic wit and biting satire, his fame rests largely on a celebrated compilation of barbed epigrams, <i>The Devil's Dictionary</i>, and a book of short stories (<i>Tales of Soldiers and Civilians</i>, 1891). Most of the 16 selections in this volume have been taken from the latter collection.<br />The stories in this edition include: \"What I Saw at Shiloh,\" \"A Son of the Gods,\" \"Four Days in Dixie,\" \"One of the Missing,\" \"A Horseman in the Sky,\" \"The Coup de Grace,\" \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,\" \"The Story of Conscience,\" \"One Kind of Officer,\" \"Chickamauga,\" and five more.<br />Bierce's stories employ a buildup of suggestive realistic detail to produce grim and vivid tales often disturbing in their mood of fatalism and impending calamity. Hauntingly suggestive, they offer excellent examples of the author's dark pessimism and storytelling power.<br /><br />",

    "description": "Walt Whitman experienced the agonies of the Civil War firsthand, working, in his forties, as a dedicated volunteer throughout the conflict in Washington's overcrowded, understaffed military hospitals. This superb selection of his poems, letters, and prose from the war years, filled with the sights and sounds of war and its ugly aftermath, express a vast and powerful range of emotions.<br />Among the poems include here, first published in <i>Drum-Taps</i> (1865) and <i>Sequel to Drum-Taps</i> (1866), are a number of Whitman's most famous works: \"O Captain! My Captain!\" \"The Wound-Dresser,\" \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd,\" and \"Come Up from the Fields, Father.\" The letters and prose selections, including Whitman's musings on the publication of his works, on the wounded men he tended, and his impressions of Lincoln traveling about the city of Washington, offer keen insights into an extraordinary era in American history.<br />",

    "description": "The novels of Joanne Harris are a literary feast for the senses. <i>Five Quarters of the Orange</i> represents Harris's most complex and sophisticated work yet - a novel in which darkness and fierce joy come together to create an unforgettable story.<br /><br />When Framboise Simon returns to a small village on the banks of the Loire, the locals do not recognize her as the daughter of the infamous Mirabelle Dartigen - the woman they still hold responsible for a terrible tragedy that took place during the German occupation decades before. Although Framboise hopes for a new beginning she quickly discovers that past and present are inextricably intertwined. Nowhere is this truth more apparent than in the scrapbook of recipes she has inherited from her dead mother.<br /><br />With this book, Framboise re-creates her mother's dishes, which she serves in her small creperie. And yet as she studies the scrapbook - searching for clues to unlock the contradiction between her mother's sensuous love of food and often cruel demeanor - she begins to recognize a deeper meaning behind Mirabelle's cryptic scribbles. Within the journal's tattered pages lies the key to what actually transpired the summer Framboise was nine years old.<br /><br />Rich and dark. <i>Five Quarters of the Orange</i> is a novel of mothers and daughters of the past and the present, of resisting, and succumbing, and an extraordinary work by a masterful writer.",

    "description": "The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.<br /><br />Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.<br /><br />Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, \"By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?\"<br /><br />Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.",

    "description": "Nine years before the Senate campaign that made him one of the most influential and compelling voices in American politics, Barack Obama published this lyrical, unsentimental, and powerfully affecting memoir, which became a #1 New York Times bestseller when it was reissued in 2004. <b>Dreams from My Father</b> tells the story of Obama\u2019s struggle to understand the forces that shaped him as the son of a black African father and white American mother\u2014a struggle that takes him from the American heartland to the ancestral home of his great-aunt in the tiny African village of Alego. <br /><br />Obama opens his story in New York, where he hears that his father\u2014a figure he knows more as a myth than as a man\u2014has died in a car accident. The news triggers a chain of memories as Barack retraces his family\u2019s unusual history: the migration of his mother\u2019s family from small-town Kansas to the Hawaiian islands; the love that develops between his mother and a promising young Kenyan student, a love nurtured by youthful innocence and the integrationist spirit of the early sixties; his father\u2019s departure from Hawaii when Barack was two, as the realities of race and power reassert themselves; and Barack\u2019s own awakening to the fears and doubts that exist not just between the larger black and white worlds but within himself.<br /><br />Propelled by a desire to understand both the forces that shaped him and his father\u2019s legacy, Barack moves to Chicago to work as a community organizer. There, against the backdrop of tumultuous political and racial conflict, he works to turn back the mounting despair of the inner city. His story becomes one with those of the people he works with as he learns about the value of community, the necessity of healing old wounds, and the possibility of faith in the midst of adversity.<br /><br />Barack\u2019s journey comes full circle in Kenya, where he finally meets the African side of his family and confronts the bitter truth of his father\u2019s life. Traveling through a country racked by brutal poverty and tribal conflict, but whose people are sustained by a spirit of endurance and hope, Barack discovers that he is inescapably bound to brothers and sisters living an ocean away\u2014and that by embracing their common struggles he can finally reconcile his divided inheritance.<br /><br />A searching meditation on the meaning of identity in America, <b>Dreams from My Father</b> might be the most revealing portrait we have of a major American leader\u2014a man who is playing, and will play, an increasingly prominent role in healing a fractious and fragmented nation. <br /><br /><br /><br />Pictured in lefthand photograph on cover: Habiba Akumu Hussein and Barack Obama, Sr. (President Obama's paternal grandmother and his father as a young boy). Pictured in righthand photograph on cover: Stanley Dunham and Ann Dunham (President Obama's maternal grandfather and his mother as a young girl).",

All she admits to is growing up in a small Cretan village before moving to London. When Alexis decides to visit Crete, however, Sofia gives her daughter a letter to take to an old friend, and promises that through her she will learn more.<br /><br />Arriving in Plaka, Alexis is astonished to see that it lies a stone's throw from the tiny, deserted island of Spinalonga - Greece's former leper colony. Then she finds Fotini, and at last hears the story that Sofia has buried all her life: the tale of her great-grandmother Eleni and her daughters and a family rent by tragedy, war and passion. She discovers how intimately she is connected with the island, and how secrecy holds them all in its powerful grip...",

    "description": "The Prince of Darkness has been given one last shot at redemption, provided he can live out a reasonably blameless life on earth. Highly sceptical, naturally, the Old Dealmaker negotiates a trial period - a summer holiday in a human body, with all the delights of the flesh.<br /><br />The body, however, turns out to be that of Declan Gunn, a depressed writer living in Clerkenwell, interrupted in his bath mid-suicide. Ever the opportunist, and with his main scheme bubbling in the background, Luce takes the chance to tap out a few thoughts - to straighten the biblical record, to celebrate his favourite achievements, to let us know just what it's like being him.<br /><br />Neither living nor explaining turns out to be as easy as it looks. Beset by distractions, miscalculations and all the natural shocks that flesh is heir to, the Father of Lies slowly begins to learn what it's like being us.",

    "description": "Little did Wendy Werris imagine that when she began a temp job at a Hollywood bookstore in 1970 at age nineteen, she had embarked on a thirty-five year career that would stretch into a journey of self-discovery and literary enlightenment. In An Alphabetical Life, Werris reflects upon how she came to embrace the book culture as her singular way of being in the world. Her career began when the book business was conducted amid an atmosphere of civility and wry humor, and her memoir captures the essence of this time and the people she met along the way. The challenges she faced, in what was then a male-dominated industry, are also discussed \u2014 particularly in 1976 when she was one of only two women repping books in the entire country. In describing the hilarious, eccentric characters that were her colleagues, lovers, and partners in crime, the essence of retail bookselling comes alive. Among the figures she profiles are Henry Robbins, editor of The World According to Garp; Alan Kahn, then of Pickwick Bookshop in Los Angeles, now President of Barnes and Noble Publishing; and many great and memorable retail bookbuyers and authors.",

    "description": "The great national epic of Persia the most complete English-language edition and definitive translation by Dick Davis, available in a deluxe edition by Penguin Classics. <br />Wherever Persian influence has spread, the stories of the\"Shahnameh\"become deeply embedded in the culture, as amply attested by their appearance in such works as\"The Kite Runner\"and the love poems of Rumi and Hafez. Among the greatest works of world literature, this prodigious narrative, composed by the poet Ferdowsi in the late tenth century, tells the story of pre-Islamic Iran, beginning in the mythic time of creation and continuing forward to the Arab invasion in the seventh century. The sweep and psychological depth of the\"Shahnameh\"is nothing less than magnificent as it recounts classic tales like the tragedy of Rostam and Sohrab. <br />Now Dick Davis, our pre-eminent translator from the Persian (\"Washington Post\"), presents a comprehensive translation of Ferdowsi s masterpiece in an elegant combination of prose and verse, allowing the poetry of the\"Shanameh\"to sing its own tales directly, interspersed sparingly with clearly-marked explanations to ease along modern readers. <br />For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust theseries to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-datetranslations by award-winning translators.\"",

    "description": "Drawing on an exceptional combination of skills as literary biographer, novelist, and chronicler of London history, Peter Ackroyd surely re-creates the world that shaped Shakespeare--and brings the playwright himself into unusually vivid focus. With characteristic narrative panache, Ackroyd immerses us in sixteenth-century Stratford and the rural landscape\u2013the industry, the animals, even the flowers\u2013that would appear in Shakespeare\u2019s plays. He takes us through Shakespeare\u2019s London neighborhood and the fertile, competitive theater world where he worked as actor and writer. He shows us Shakespeare as a businessman, and as a constant reviser of his writing. In joining these intimate details with profound intuitions about the playwright and his work, Ackroyd has produced an altogether engaging masterpiece.",

    "description": "<i>The Silmarillion</i> is Tolkien's first book and his last. Long preceding in its origins <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, it is the story of the First Age of Tolkien's world, the ancient drama to which characters in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> look back, and in which some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part. <i>The Silmarillion</i> was begun in 1917, and Tolkien worked on it, changed it, and enlarged it throughout his life. Edited by his son, Christopher Tolkien, the book finally appeared four years after the author's death.",

    "description": "<i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Jodi Picoult is widely acclaimed for her keen insights into the hearts and minds of real people. Now she tells the emotionally riveting story of a family torn apart by conflicting needs and a passionate love that triumphs over human weakness.<p>Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate -- a life and a role that she has never challenged...until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister -- and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves. <i>My Sister's Keeper</i> examines what it means to be a good parent, a good sister, a good person. Is it morally correct to do whatever it takes to save a child's life, even if that means infringing upon the rights of another? Is it worth trying to discover who you really are, if that quest makes you like yourself less? Should you follow your own heart, or let others lead you? Once again, in <i>My Sister's Keeper,</i> Jodi Picoult tackles a controversial real-life subject with grace, wisdom, and sensitivity.</p>",

The reader is swept into the whirlpool of pageantry, passion, splendor, chaos and earth-shattering upheaval that was ancient Rome.

In a world where his three true, bitter pleasures are women, booze, and racetrack betting, he somehow drags his hangover out of bed every dawn to lug waterlogged mailbags up mud-soaked mountains, outsmart vicious guard dogs, and pray to survive the day-to-day trials of sadistic bosses and certifiable coworkers. This classic 1971 novel\u2014the one that catapulted its author to national fame\u2014is the perfect introduction to the grimly hysterical world of legendary writer, poet, and Dirty Old Man Charles Bukowski and his fictional alter ego, Chinaski.",

Playing cards and getting drunk, he uses all his cunning and genial subterfuge to deal with the police, clergy, and officers who chivy him toward battle.<br /><br />Cecil Parrott's vibrant translation conveys the brilliant irreverence of this classic about a hapless Everyman caught in a vast bureaucratic machine.",

    "description": "A fresh and brilliantly told memoir from a cult favorite comic artist, marked by gothic twists, a family funeral home, sexual angst, and great books.<br /><br />This breakout book by Alison Bechdel is a darkly funny family tale, pitch-perfectly illustrated with Bechdel's sweetly gothic drawings. Like Marjane Satrapi's <i>Persepolis</i>, it's a story exhilaratingly suited to graphic memoir form.<br /><br />Meet Alison's father, a historic preservation expert and obsessive restorer of the family's Victorian home, a third-generation funeral home director, a high school English teacher, an icily distant parent, and a closeted homosexual who, as it turns out, is involved with his male students and a family babysitter. Through narrative that is alternately heartbreaking and fiercely funny, we are drawn into a daughter's complex yearning for her father. And yet, apart from assigned stints dusting caskets at the family-owned \"fun home,\" as Alison and her brothers call it, the relationship achieves its most intimate expression through the shared code of books.<br /><br />When Alison comes out as homosexual herself in late adolescence, the denouement is swift, graphic \u2014 and redemptive.",

It is a horrifying yet restrained narrative of the Holocaust. It is a searing vision of the wounds of the twentieth century, and an attempt to heal them. Interweaving poetry and case history, fantasy and historical truth-telling, <i>The White Hotel</i> is a modern classic of enduring emotional power that attempts nothing less than to reconcile the notion of individual destiny with that of historical fate.",

    "description": "This is a remarkable historical and psychological examination of the enigma of Adolf Hitler--who he was, how he wielded power, and why he was destined to fail.<br /><br />Beginning with Hitler's early life, Sebastian Haffner probes the historical, political, and emotional forces that molded his character. In examining the inhumanity of a man for whom politics became a substitute for life, he discusses Hitler's bizarre relationships with women, his arrested psychological development, his ideological misconceptions, his growing obsession with racial extermination, and the murderous rages of his distorted mind. Finally, Haffner confronts the most disturbing question of all: Could another Hitler rise to power in modern Germany?",

    "description": "Often called the greatest nineteenth-century British novelist, <b>George Eliot</b> (the pen name of Mary Ann Evans) created in <i>Middlemarch</i> a vast panorama of life in a provincial Midlands town. At the story\u2019s center stands the intellectual and idealistic Dorothea Brooke\u2014a character who in many ways resembles Eliot herself. But the very qualities that set Dorothea apart from the materialistic, mean-spirited society around her also lead her into a disastrous marriage with a man she mistakes for her soul mate. In a parallel story, young doctor Tertius Lydgate, who is equally idealistic, falls in love with the pretty but vain and superficial Rosamund Vincy, whom he marries to his ruin.Eliot surrounds her main figures with a gallery of characters drawn from every social class, from laborers and shopkeepers to the rising middle class to members of the wealthy, landed gentry. Together they form an extraordinarily rich and precisely detailed portrait of English provincial life in the 1830s. But Dorothea\u2019s and Lydgate\u2019s struggles to retain their moral integrity in the midst of temptation and tragedy remind us that their world is very much like our own. Strikingly modern in its painful ironies and psychological insight, <i>Middlemarch</i> was pivotal in the shaping of twentieth-century literary realism.<br /><br /><i>Middlemarch</i>, by <b>George Eliot</b>, is part of the <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i> series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.<br /><br /><b>Lynne Sharon Schwartz</b> is the author of fourteen books of fiction, non-fiction, and poetry, including the novels <i>Disturbances in the Field, Leaving Brooklyn</i>, and <i>In the Family Way</i>, and the memoir <i>Ruined by Reading</i>. Her poetry collection <i>In Solitary</i> and her translation of <i>A Place to Live: Selected Essays of Natalia Ginzburg</i> appeared in 2002.",

As she reaches adulthood, the clash between their expectations and her desires is painfully played out as she finds herself torn between her relationships with three very different men: her proud and stubborn brother, a close friend who is also the son of her family's worst enemy, and a charismatic but dangerous suitor. With its poignant portrayal of sibling relationships, The Mill on the Floss is considered George Eliot's most autobiographical novel; it is also one of her most powerful and moving.<br /><br />In this edition writer and critic A.S. Byatt provides full explanatory notes and an introduction relating <i>Mill on the Floss</i> to George Eliot's own life and times.<br /><br />Edited with an introduction and notes by A.S. BYATT",

A distinctly worryingly human animal is now on the loose, and the professor's hitherto respectable life becomes a nightmare beyond endurance. An absurd and superbly comic story, this classic novel can also be read as a fierce parable of the Russian Revolution.",

This is the chronicle of three generations of Clearys, ranchers carving lives from a beautiful, hard land while contending with the bitterness, frailty, and secrets that penetrate their family. Most of all, it is the story of only daughter Meggie and her lifelong relationship with the haunted priest Father Ralph de Bricassart - an intense joining of two hearts and souls that dangerously oversteps sacred boundaries of ethics and dogma.<br /><br />A poignant love story, a powerful epic of struggle and sacrifice, a celebration of individuality and spirit, Colleen McCullough's acclaimed masterwork remains a monumental literary achievement - a landmark novel to be cherished and read again and again.<br />(back cover)",

If you think you know the legend, you know only half the truth. Here is the mystery, the myth, the terror, and the magic of\u2026<br /><br /><b>DEAN KOONTZ\u2019S CITY OF NIGHT</b><br /><br />They are stronger, heal better, and think faster than any humans ever created\u2013and they must be destroyed. But not even Victor Helios\u2013once Frankenstein\u2013can stop the engineered killers he\u2019s set loose on a reign of terror through modern-day New Orleans. Now the only hope rests in a one-time \u201cmonster\u201d and his all-too-human partners, Detectives Carson O\u2019Connor and Michael Maddison. Deucalion\u2019s centuries-old history began as Victor\u2019s first and failed attempt to build the perfect human\u2013and it is fated to end in the ultimate confrontation between a damned creature and his mad creator. But first Deucalion must destroy a monstrosity not even Victor\u2019s malignant mind could have imagined\u2013an indestructible entity that steps out of humankind\u2019s collective nightmare with one purpose: to replace us.",

    "description": "A market leader for over 30 years, A HISTORY OF MODERN PSYCHOLOGY has been praised for its comprehensive coverage and biographical approach. Focusing on modern psychology, the text's coverage begins with the late 19th century. The authors personalize the history of psychology not only by using biographical information on influential theorists, but also by showing how major events in those theorists' lives have affected the authors' own ideas, approaches, and methods. Substantial updates in this edition include discussions of evolutionary psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and positive psychology. The result is a text that is as timely and relevant today as it was when it was first introduced.",

Despu\u00e9s de esta primera experiencia, Lul\u00fa, ni\u00f1a eterna, alimenta durante a\u00f1os, en solitario, el fantasma de aquel hombre que acaba por aceptar el desaf\u00edo de prolongar indefinidamente, en su peculiar relaci\u00f3n sexual, el juego amoroso de la ni\u00f1ez. Crea para ella un mundo aparte, un universo privado donde el tiempo pierde valor. Pero el sortilegio arriesgado de vivir fuera de la realidad se rompe bruscamente un d\u00eda.",

    "description": "R\u00f3mulo Gallegos is best known for being Venezuela\u2019s first democratically elected president. But in his native land he is equally famous as a writer responsible for one of Venezuela\u2019s literary treasures, the novel <i>Do\u00f1a Barbara</i>. Published in 1929 and all but forgotten by Anglophone readers, <i>Do\u00f1a Barbara</i> is one of the first examples of magical realism, laying the groundwork for later authors such as Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Mario Vargas Llosa.<br /><br />Following the epic struggle between two cousins for an estate in Venezuela, <i>Do\u00f1a Barbara</i> is an examination of the conflict between town and country, violence and intellect, male and female. Do\u00f1a Barbara is a beautiful and mysterious woman\u2014rumored to be a witch\u2014with a ferocious power over men. When her cousin Santos Luzardo returns to the plains in order to reclaim his land and cattle, he reluctantly faces off against Do\u00f1a Barbara, and their battle becomes simultaneously one of violence and seduction. All of the action is set against the stunning backdrop of the Venezuelan prairie, described in loving detail. Gallegos\u2019s plains are filled with dangerous ranchers, intrepid cowboys, and damsels in distress, all broadly and vividly drawn. A masterful novel with an important role in the inception of magical realism, <i>Do\u00f1a Barbara</i> is a suspenseful tale that blends fantasy, adventure, and romance.<br /><br />Hailed as \u201cthe Bovary of the <i>llano</i>\u201d by Larry McMurtry in his new foreword to this book, Do\u00f1a Barbarais a magnetic and memorable heroine, who has inspired numerous adaptations on the big and small screens, including a recent television show that aired on Telemundo.",

    "description": "The year is 1738; the place, Paris. A baby is born under a fish-monger\u2019s bloody table in a marketplace, and abandoned. Orphaned, passed over to the monks as a charity case, already there is something in the aura of the tiny infant that is unsettling. No one will look after him; he is somehow too demanding, and, even more disturbing, something is missing: as his wet nurse tries to explain, he doesn\u2019t <i>smell</i> the way a baby should smell; indeed, he has no scent at all.<br /><br />Slowly, as we watch Jean-Baptiste Grenouille cling stubbornly to life, we begin to realize that a monster is growing before our eyes. With mounting unease, yet hypnotized, we see him explore his powers and their effect on the world around him. For this dark and sinister boy who has no smell himself possesses an absolute sense of smell, and with it he can read the world to discover the hidden truths that elude ordinary men. He can smell the very composition of objects, and their history, and where they have been, he has no need of the light, and darkness is not dark to him, because nothing can mask the odors of the universe. <br /><br />As he leaves childhood behind and comes to understand his terrible uniqueness, his obsession becomes the quest to identify, and then to isolate, the most perfect scent of all, the scent of life itself.<br /><br />At first, he hones his powers, learning the ancient arts of perfume-making until the exquisite fragrances he creates are the rage of Paris, and indeed Europe. Then, secure in his mastery of these means to an end, he withdraws into a strange and agonized solitude, waiting, dreaming, until the morning when he wakes, ready to embark on his monstrous quest: to find and extract from the most perfect living creatures\u2014the most beautiful young virgins in the land\u2014 that ultimate perfume which alone can make him, too, fully human. As his trail leads him, at an ever-quickening pace, from his savage exile to the heart of the country and then back to Paris, we are caught up in a rising storm of terror and mortal sensual conquest until the frenzy of his final triumph explodes in all its horrifying consequences. <br /><br />Told with dazzling narrative brilliance and the haunting power of a grown-up fairy tale, <i>Perfume</i> is one of the most remarkable novels of the last fifty years.",

    "description": "A classic of Mexican modern literature about a haunted village.<br /><br />As one enters Juan Rulfo's legendary novel, one follows a dusty road to a town of death. Time shifts from one consciousness to another in a hypnotic flow of dreams, desires, and memories, a world of ghosts dominated by the figure of Pedro P\u00e1ramo - lover, overlord, murderer.<br /><br />Rulfo's extraordinary mix of sensory images, violent passions and unfathomable mysteries has been a profound influence on a whole generation of Latin American writers including Carlos Fuentes, Mario Vargas Llosa, and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. To read Pedro P\u00e1ramo today is as overwhelming an experience as when it was first published in Mexico nearly fifty years ago.",

La France des guerres de religion est devenue le champ clos des grands seigneurs et des pr\u00e9tendants au tr\u00f4ne. \u00c0 Paris, le jeune roi protestant de Navarre, le futur Henri IV, vient d'\u00e9pouser Marguerite de Valois, dite Margot ; mariage politique qui n'emp\u00eache pas les Guise et le roi Charles IX de fomenter les horreurs de la Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy.<br />Sur les pas du jeune comte de La Mole, dont s'\u00e9prend \u00e9perdument la belle Margot, et de son compagnon, le tonitruant Annibal de Coconnas, nous entrons dans ce labyrinthe d'intrigues, d'alliances, de trahisons. Les poignards luisent sous les pourpoints. Ren\u00e9 le Florentin fournit les poisons \u00e0 l'implacable Catherine de M\u00e9dicis.<br />Le vieux Louvre avec ses f\u00eates brillantes, ses passages secrets, son peuple de soldats et de jolies femmes, est le th\u00e9\u00e2tre o\u00f9 se d\u00e9ploient en mille p\u00e9rip\u00e9ties les jeux de l'amour, de la politique, de la haine. Le p\u00e8re des <i>Trois Mousquetaires</i> nous en donne une passionnante chronique o\u00f9 sa p\u00e9tulante bonne humeur survit aux plus sanglants \u00e9pisodes.",

    "description": "Far in the future, the World Controllers have created the ideal society. Through clever use of genetic engineering, brainwashing and recreational sex and drugs, all its members are happy consumers. Bernard Marx seems alone in feeling discontent. Harbouring an unnatural desire for solitude, and a perverse distaste for the pleasure of compulsory promiscuity, Bernard has an ill-defined longing to break free. A visit to one of the few remaining Savage Reservations, where the old, imperfect life still continues, may be the cure for his distress. Huxley's ingenious fantasy of the future sheds a blazing light on the present and is considered to be his most enduring masterpiece.",

Alongside the body, police have found a series of baffling codes. As Langdon and a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, begin to sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to find a trail that leads to the works of Leonardo Da Vinci - and suggests the answer to a mystery that stretches deep into the vaults of history.<br /><br />Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine code and quickly assemble the pieces of the puzzle, a stunning historical truth will be lost forever...<br />(back cover)",

Beloved by millions for his paintings, Thomas Kincade is often asked by his fans what kind of people inhabited his landscapes. Cape Light is the answer. <br /> Thomas Kincade has become a modern-day Norman Rockwell, painting, in his words, scenes that serve as places of refuge for battle-weary people. In this novel, he invites readers to enter a similar place of refuge: Cape Light. Nestled in Coastal New England, this picturesque little village is a seaside hamlet where folks still enjoy a strong sense of community, and everybody cares about their neighbors. they are friends and neighbors, doers and dreamers. They are the people who laugh and love and build their lives together in the town of Cape Light--and their story will capture readers' hearts forever.",

    "description": "\u201cThe economy [isn\u2019t] a bunch of rather dull statistics with names like GDP (gross domestic product),\u201d notes Tim Harford, columnist and regular guest on NPR\u2019s Marketplace, \u201ceconomics is about who gets what and why.\u201d In this acclaimed and riveting book\u2013part expos\u00e9, part user\u2019s manual\u2013the astute and entertaining columnist from the Financial Times demystifies the ways in which money works in the world. From why the coffee in your cup costs so much to why efficiency is not necessarily the answer to ensuring a fair society, from improving health care to curing crosstown traffic\u2013all the dirty little secrets of dollars and cents are delightfully revealed by <i>The Undercover Economist</i>.<br /><br />\u201cA rare specimen: a book on economics that will enthrall its readers . . . It brings the power of economics to life.\u201d<br />\u2013Steven D. Levitt, coauthor of <i>Freakonomics<br /></i><br />\u201cA playful guide to the economics of everyday life, and as such is something of an elder sibling to Steven Levitt\u2019s wild child, the hugely successful Freakonomics.\u201d<br />\u2013<i>The Economist</i><br /><br />\u201cA tour de force . . . If you need to be convinced of the everrelevant and fascinating nature of economics, read this insightful and witty book.\u201d<br />\u2013Jagdish Bhagwati, author of <i>In Defense of Globalization<br /></i><br />\u201cThis is a book to savor.\u201d<br />\u2013<i>The New York Times</i><br /><br />\u201cHarford writes like a dream. From his book I found out why there\u2019s a Starbucks on every corner [and] how not to get duped in an auction. Reading The Undercover Economist is like spending an ordinary day wearing X-ray goggles.\u201d<br />\u2013David Bodanis, author of <i>Electric Universe</i><br /><br />\u201cMuch wit and wisdom.\u201d<br /><i>\u2013The Houston Chronicle</i><br />From <i>Publishers Weekly </i><br />Nattily packaged-the cover sports a Roy Lichtensteinesque image of an economist in Dick Tracy garb-and cleverly written, this book applies basic economic theory to such modern phenomena as Starbucks' pricing system and Microsoft's stock values. While the concepts explored are those encountered in Microeconomics 101, Harford gracefully explains abstruse ideas like pricing along the demand curve and game theory using real world examples without relying on graphs or jargon. The book addresses free market economic theory, but Harford is not a complete apologist for capitalism; he shows how companies from Amazon.com to Whole Foods to Starbucks have gouged consumers through guerrilla pricing techniques and explains the high rents in London (it has more to do with agriculture than one might think). Harford comes down soft on Chinese sweatshops, acknowledging \"conditions in factories are terrible,\" but \"sweatshops are better than the horrors that came before them, and a step on the road to something better.\" Perhaps, but Harford doesn't question whether communism or a capitalist-style industrial revolution are the only two choices available in modern economies. That aside, the book is unequaled in its accessibility and ability to show how free market economic forces affect readers' day-to-day.<br />Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. <br />From <i>Bookmarks Magazine</i><br />Harford exposes the dark underbelly of capitalism in <i>Undercover Economist</i>. Compared with Steven Levitt\u2019s and Stephen J. Dubner\u2019s popular <i>Freakonomics </i>(*** July/Aug 2005), the book uses simple, playful examples (written in plain English) to elucidate complex economic theories. Critics agree that the book will grip readers interested in understanding free-market forces but disagree about Harford\u2019s approach. Some thought the author mastered the small ideas while keeping in sight the larger context of globalization; others faulted Harford for failing to criticize certain economic theories and to ground his arguments in political, organizational structures. Either way, his case studies\u2014some entertaining, others indicative of times to come\u2014will make you think twice about that cup of coffee. <br />Copyright \u00a9 2004 Phillips &amp; Nelson Media, Inc.",

    "description": "<i>Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat</i> chronicles the multifarious adventures of this wild child and his faithful, but skeptical, friend. If the best cartoons compel readers to identify themselves within the funny frames, then all who enjoy <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> are creative, imaginative, and ... bad, bad, bad! Calvin, the irascible little boy with the stuffed tiger who comes to life are a pair bound for trouble. Boring school lessons become occasions for death-defying alien air battles, speeding snow sled descents elicit philosophical discussions on the meaning of life, and Hobbe's natural inclination to pounce on his little friend wreaks havoc on Calvin's sense of security. Calvin's the kid we all wish we\"d been. Sassy, imaginative, far more verbal than his parents can manage, Calvin is the quintessential bad boy--and the boy we love to see. He terrorizes little Susie, offers \"Candid Opinions\" from a neighborhood stand, and questions his parents\" authority. \"What assurance do I have that your parenting isn't screwing me up?\" he demands. <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> manages to say what needs to be said about childhood and life: \"Eww, mud,\" says Calvin. \"Look at this gooshy, dirty, slimy, thick, wet mud... Bleecch... Talk about a kid magnet!\"",

    "description": "The September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon left us stunned, angry, and uncomprehending. As it became clear that these horrifying acts had been committed in the name of religion, the media, the government, and ordinary citizens alike sought answers to questions about Islam and its adherents.<br />In this level-headed and authoritative book, John L. Esposito, one of the world's most respected scholars of political Islam, provides answers. He clearly and carefully explains the teachings of Islam--the Quran, the example of the Prophet, Islamic law--about jihad or holy war, the use of violence, and terrorism. He chronicles the rise of extremist groups and examines their frightening worldview and tactics. Anti-Americanism (and anti-Europeanism), he shows, is a broad-based phenomenon that cuts across Arab and Muslim societies. It is not just driven by religious zealotry, but by frustration and anger at U.S. policy. It is vital to understand, however, that the vast majority of Muslims are appalled by the acts of violence committed in the name of their faith. It is essential that we distinguish between the religion of Islam and the actions of extremists like Osama bin Laden, who hijack Islamic discourse and belief to justify their acts of terrorism. This brief, clear-sighted book reflects twenty years of study, reflection, and experience on the part of a scholar who is equally respected in the West and in the Muslim world. It will prove to be the best single guide to the urgent questions that have recently forced themselves on the attention of the entire world.<br />",

    "description": "This book traces the origins of the \"illegal alien\" in American law and society, explaining why and how illegal migration became the central problem in U.S. immigration policy--a process that profoundly shaped ideas and practices about citizenship, race, and state authority in the twentieth century.<br /><br />Mae Ngai offers a close reading of the legal regime of restriction that commenced in the 1920s--its statutory architecture, judicial genealogies, administrative enforcement, differential treatment of European and non-European migrants, and long-term effects. In well-drawn historical portraits, Ngai peoples her study with the Filipinos, Mexicans, Japanese, and Chinese who comprised, variously, illegal aliens, alien citizens, colonial subjects, and imported contract workers. She shows that immigration restriction, particularly national-origin and numerical quotas, re-mapped the nation both by creating new categories of racial difference and by emphasizing as never before the nation's contiguous land borders and their patrol. This yielded the \"illegal alien,\" a new legal and political subject whose inclusion in the nation was a social reality but a legal impossibility--a subject without rights and excluded from citizenship. Questions of fundamental legal status created new challenges for liberal democratic society and have directly informed the politics of multiculturalism and national belonging in our time.<br /><br />Ngai's analysis is based on extensive archival research, including previously unstudied records of the U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration and Naturalization Service. Contributing to American history, legal history, and ethnic studies, Impossible Subjects is a major reconsideration of U.S. immigration in the twentieth century.",

It seeks to bring some coherence to the rich monographic literature that has appeared in recent years, and thereby give the remarkable American Century the history it deserves.",

    "description": "Christmas has never been a particularly good time for Dr Kay Scarpetta. Although a holiday for most, the festivities always seem to heighten the alienation felt by society's violent fringe; and that usually means more work for Scarpetta, Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner and consulting forensic pathologist for the FBI.<br /><br />The body was naked, female, and found propped against a fountain in a bleak area of New York's Central Park. Her apparent manner of death points to a modus operandi that is chillingly familar: the gunshot wound to the head, the sections of skin excised from the body, the displayed corpse - all suggest that Temple Brooks Gault, Scarpetta's nemesis, is back at work.<br /><br />Calling on all her reserves of courage and skill, and the able assistance of colleagues Marino and Wesley, Scarpetta must track this most dangerous of killers in pursuit of survival as well as justice - heading inexorably to an electrifying climax amid the dark, menacing labyrinths of the New York subway.",

    "description": "For Dr. David Beck, the loss was shattering. And every day for the past eight years, he has relived the horror of what happened. The gleaming lake. The pale moonlight. The piercing screams. The night his wife was taken. The last night he saw her alive.<br /><br />Everyone tells him it's time to move on, to forget the past once and for all. But for David Beck, there can be no closure. A message has appeared on his computer, a phrase only he and his dead wife know. Suddenly Beck is taunted with the impossible- that somewhere, somehow, Elizabeth is alive.<br /><br />Beck has been warned to tell no one. And he doesn't. Instead, he runs from the people he trusts the most, plunging headlong into a search for the shadowy figure whose messages hold out a desperate hope.<br /><br />But already Beck is being hunted down. He's headed straight into the heart of a dark and deadly secret- and someone intends to stop him before he gets there.",

    "description": "\"In the beginning, there was chaos...\" Margaret Atwood's chilling new novel <i>Oryx and Crake</i> moves beyond the futuristic fantasy of her 1985 bestseller <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i> to an even more dystopian world, a world where language--and with it anything beyond the merest semblance of humanity--has almost entirely vanished. <p> Snowman may be the last man on earth, the only survivor of an unnamed apocalypse. Once he was Jimmy, a member of a scientific elite; now he lives in bitter isolation and loneliness, his only pleasure the watching of old films on DVD. His mind moves backwards and forwards through time, from an agonising trawl through memory to relive the events that led up to sudden catastrophe (most significantly the disappearance of his mother and the arrival of his mysterious childhood companions Oryx and Crake, symbols of the fractured society in which Snowman now finds himself, to the horrifying present of genetic engineering run amok. His only witnesses, eager to lap up his testimony, are \"Crakers\", laboratory creatures of varying strengths and abilities, who can offer little comfort. Gradually the reasons behind the disaster begin to unfold as Snowman undertakes a perilous journey to the remains of the bubble-dome complex where the sinister Paradice Project collapsed and near-global devastation began. </p><p> This, Atwood's 11th novel, confirms her as one of our most contemporary novelists. Darkly humorous and icily prescient, <i>Oryx and Crake</i> shows a writer deeply concerned with the stark moral issues facing the human race, and accords a glimpse of a future that lies all too uneasily within reach. --<i>Catherine Taylor</i></p>",

    "description": "<b>Oscar Wilde</b> brings his enormous gifts for astute social observation and sparkling prose to <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>, his dreamlike story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. This dandy, who remains forever unchanged; petulant, hedonistic, vain, and amoral; while a painting of him ages and grows increasingly hideous with the years, has been horrifying, enchanting, obsessing, even corrupting readers for more than a hundred years. <p>Taking the reader in and out of London drawing rooms, to the heights of aestheticism, and to the depths of decadence, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is not only a melodrama about moral corruption. Laced with bon mots and vivid depictions of upper-class refinement, it is also a fascinating look at the milieu of Wilde\u2019s fin-de-si\u00e8cle world and a manifesto of the creed \u0093Art for Art\u2019s Sake.\u201d </p><p>The ever-quotable Wilde, who once delighted London with his scintillating plays, scandalized readers with this, his only novel. Upon publication, Dorian was condemned as dangerous, poisonous, stupid, vulgar, and immoral, and Wilde as a \u0093driveling pedant.\u201d The novel, in fact, was used against Wilde at his much-publicized trials for \u0093gross indecency,\u201d which led to his imprisonment and exile on the European continent. Even so, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> firmly established Wilde as one of the great voices of the Aesthetic movement, and endures as a classic that is as timeless as its hero.</p>",

    "description": "Carl Streator is a reporter investigating Sudden Infant Death Syndrome for a soft-news feature. After responding to several calls with paramedics, he notices that all the dead children were read the same poem from the same library book the night before they died. It's a 'culling song' - an ancient African spell for euthanising sick or old people. Researching it, he meets a woman who killed her own child with it accidentally. He himself accidentally killed his own wife and child with the same poem twenty years earlier. Together, the man and the woman must find and destroy all copies of this book, and try not to kill every rude sonofabitch that gets in their way. <i>Lullaby</i> is a comedy/drama/tragedy. In that order. It may also be Chuck Palahniuk's best book yet.",

Now he's on his own, on the run, determined to discover the truth about his father disappearance.<br /><br />Then Will steps through a window in the air into another world, and finds himself with a companion - a strange, savage little girl called Lyra. Like Will, she has a mission which she intends to carry out at all costs.<br /><br />But the world of Citt\u00e0gazze is a strange and unsettling place. Deadly, soul-eating Spectres stalk in its streets, while high above, the wingbeats of distant angels sound against the sky. And in the mysterious Torre degli Angeli lurks Citt\u00e0gazze's most important secret - an object which people from many worlds would kill to posses.",

    "description": "This story is a rare and utterly engaging experience. It tells the extraordinary story of a geisha -summoning up a quarter century from 1929 to the post-war years of Japan's dramatic history, and opening a window into a half-hidden world of eroticism and enchantment, exploitation and degradation. A young peasant girl is sold as servant and apprentice to a renowned geisha house. She tells her story many years later from the Waldorf Astoria in New York. Her memoirs conjure up the perfection and the ugliness of life behind rice-paper screens, where young girls learn the arts of geisha - dancing and singing, how to wind the kimono, how to walk and pour tea, and how to beguile the land's most powerful men.",

    "description": "The complete <i>Blackadder </i>scripts by Richard Curtis, Ben Elton, Rowan Atkinson and John Lloyd.<br /><br />Twenty-six years ago, Edmund Blackadder made his first appearance on our screens. Comedy has never been the same since (nor indeed has history).<br /><br />Gathered here - in this twenty-sixth anniversary commemorative edition - are the complete scripts of Blackadder's adventures and, mostly, misadventures. <i>Blackadder</i>, <i>Blackadder II,</i> <i>Blackadder the Third</i> and <i>Blackadder Goes Forth</i>. Every word, every lie, every cunning plan and cock-up.<br /><br />From medieval nastiness, through Elizabethan and Regency glory, to the mud and saut\u00e9ed rats of the First World War, Blackadder and his oafish underling Baldrick can be most definitely blamed for ruining England's reputation as a country with a great history.<br /><br />This historical record has been set down by Mr Richard Curtis, Mr Ben Elton, Mr Rowan Atkinson and Mr John Lloyd.<br /><br /><br />Richard Curtis is the writer/director behind <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i>, <i>Love Actually</i> and <i>The Boat That Rocked</i>) and Ben Elton is the bestselling author and writer of <i>The Young Ones</i>, <i>The Man From Auntie</i> and <i>The Thin Blue Line. </i>The character of Blackadder was played by Rowan Atkinson, who is the star of the Mr Bean TV series and films, and <i>Johnny English</i>. The four <i>Blackadder </i>series, produced by John Lloyd, won numerous BAFTAs and also an EMMY.",

And suppose your friend went on to confess that he wasn't from around here at all, but rather from a small planet near Betelgeuse? And what if the world really did come to an end, but instead of being blown away, you found yourself hitching a ride on a spaceship with your buddy as a traveling companion?<br /><br />It happens to Arthur Dent.<br /><br />An ordinary guy from a small town in England, Arthur is one lucky sonofagun: his alien friend, Ford Prefect, is in fact a roving researcher for the universally bestselling Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ... and expert at seeing the cosmos on 30 Altairian dollars a day. Ford lives by the Guide's seminal bit of advice: Don't Panic. Which comes in handy when their first ride--on the very same vessel that demolished Earth to make way for a hyperspacial freeway--ends disastrously (they are booted out of an airlock). with 30 seconds of air in their lungs and the odd of being picked up by another ship 2^276,709 to 1 against, the pair are scooped up by the only ship in the universe powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive.<br /><br />But this (and the idea that Bogart movies and McDonald's hamburgers now exist only in his mind) is just the beginning of the weird things Arthur will have to get used to. For, on his travels, he'll encounter Zaphod Beeblebrox, the two-headed, three-armed ex-President of the Galaxy; Trillian, a sexy spacecadet he once tried to pick up at a cocktail party, now Zaphod's girlfriend; Marvin, a chronically depressed robot; and Slartibartfast, the award-winning engineer who built the Earth and travels in a spaceship disguised as a bistro.<br /><br />Arthur's crazed wanderings will take him from the restaurant at the end of the Universe (where the main dish of the day introduces itself and the floor show is doomsday), to the planet Krikkit (locked in Slo-Time to punish its inhabitants for trying to end the Universe), to Earth (huh? wait! wasn't it destroyed?!) to the very offices of The Hitchhiker's Guide itself as he and his friends quest for the answer to the Question of Life, the Universe and Everything ... and search for a really good cup of tea.<br /><br />Ready or not, Arthur Dent is in for one hell of a ride!",

    "description": "When Jonathan Harker visits Transylvania to help Count Dracula purchase a London house, he makes horrifying discoveries in his client's castle. Soon afterwards, disturbing incidents unfold in England: a ship runs aground on the shores of Whitby, its crew vanished; beautiful Lucy Westenra slowly succumbs to a mysterious, wasting illness, her blood drained away; and the lunatic Renfield raves about the imminent arrival of his 'master'. In the ensuing battle of wills between the sinister Count and a determined group of adversaries - led by the intrepid vampire hunter Abraham van Helsing - Bram Stoker created a masterpiece of the horror genre, probing into questions of identity, sanity and the dark corners of Victorian sexuality and desire.<br />For this completely updated edition, Maurice Hindle has revised his introduction, list of further reading and notes, and added two appendices: Stoker's essay on censorship and his interview with Winston Churchill, both published in 1908. Christopher Frayling's preface discusses the significance and the influences that contributed to his creation of the Dracula myth.<br /><br />For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",

    "description": "Falling in love...falling under the influence...falling into temptation...falling ill...falling apart...falling from grace...Lucas has no idea there are so many painful ways to fall.Through a long summer of oppressive heat and suspense, Lucas becomes aware of many things he does not understand. What can his Grandfather have done during the war to provoke such hostility in his own home town? Why is there growing crme and tension i the neighbourhood? What is his attitude to immigrants and refugees? How should he respond to his new friend, Benoit, whose arguments confuse and compel him, or to Caitlin, with her enigmatic ways and her beautiful, sad dancing? And how should he act when the crisis comes?A deep, disturbing book about the inexorable influence of the past on the present, the seductive power of extreme nationalism and racism, the complexities of moral and political choice, and the gulf between intentions and consequences a haunting story of love, fear, anger and forgiveness.Falling was first published in Belgium. It has won five major literary awards, topped best-seller lists and been translated into many languages. With her sharp prose and unswerving gaze, Anne Provoost probes personal and social dilemmas that are increasingly relevant.",

    "description": "<strong>A Fable About Following Your Dream</strong><br />Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world, and this tenth anniversary edition, with a new introduction from the author, will only increase that following. This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and inspiring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids. Along the way he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles along the way. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasures found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.",

The ancient Greek Epicurus has the wisest, and most affordable, solution to cash flow problems. A remedy for impotence lies in Montaigne. Seneca offers advice upon losing a job. And Nietzsche has shrewd counsel for everything from loneliness to illness. The Consolations of Philosophy is a book as accessibly erudite as it is useful and entertaining.",

    "description": "In the tradition of Ellis Peters, A Plague on Both Your Houses introduces the physician Matthew Bartholomew, whose unorthodox but effective treatment of his patients frequently draws accusations of heresy from his more traditional colleagues. Besides his practice, Bartholomew is teacher of Medicine at Michaelhouse, part of the fledgling University of Cambridge. In 1348, the inhabitants of Cambridge live under the shadow of a terrible pestilence that has ravaged Europe and is travelling relentlessly eastward towards England. Bartholomew, however, is distracted by the sudden and inexplicable death of the Master of Michaelhouse - a death the University authorities do not want investigated. When three more scholars die in mysterious circumstances, Bartholomew defies the University and begins his own enquiry. His pursuit for the truth leads him into a complex tangle of lies and intrigue that causes him to question the innocence of his closest friends, and even his family. And then the Black Death finally arrives and Bartholomew is dragged deeper and deeper into a quagmire which threatens not only his life, but the continued existence of the University and the future of the town.",

    "description": "The complete and unexpurgated scripts of one of the most celebrated comedy series ever. Published in its entirety for the first time and illustrated, <i>The Complete Fawlty Towers</i> will appeal to the millions of fans who have suffered through endless PBS fundraisers waiting for the next episode -- and anyone who has survived a package holiday tour. Fawlty Towers is the hotel of every traveler's nightmare. Basil Fawlty -- ill-tempered, henpecked, and conniving -- tries in vain to be master of his house under the disapproving and ever-watchful eye of his wife, Sybil. The hotel offers service by Manuel, the incompetent Spanish waiter whose feeble grasp of English makes for hilarious misunderstandings, and Polly, the unflappable chambermaid who is Fawlty Towers' only sane employee. Meals are scorched in the kitchen while adulterers consort upstairs and chaos reigns all around. For countless fans, Fawlty Towers is the best-loved bad hotel in the world, and with publication of <i>The Complete Fawlty Towers</i> they will all have a chance to relive its outrageous awfulness.",

He knows only that he is called the Doctor - nothing more. But something deep inside tells him to trust the TARDIS, and his hands move over the controls of their own accord.<br /><br />The TARDIS takes him to a strangely familiar junkyard in late-nineties London, where he is flung into a confrontation between local drug-dealers and Samantha Jones, a rebellious teenager from Coal Hill School.<br /><br />But the Doctor soon finds the TARDIS transporting him to various other places in order to recover all his memories - and that involves seeing seven strangely-familiar faces...",

The bodies of the dead are being stolen from their graves - men, women and children alike - for the sinister purpose of a very mysterious gentleman.<br /><br />When the Eighth Doctor and Sam arrive, they are witness to a horrifying scene in the evil-smelling fog: something rises up from the filthy waters of the Thames and devours a man - a man terrified for his life and on the run from the devil himself...<br /><br />Teaming up with an old friend, pathologist Professor George Litefoot, the Doctor is determined to get to the bottom of the mystery. Together with Sam, they discover there is a far graver threat facing London then just earthly grave robbers. Deadly alien beings the Doctor has encountered before are at work, and they bring a whole new twist to the word bodysnatchers...",

    "description": "Few books on software project management have been as influential and timeless as The Mythical Man-Month. With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects. These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 20 years after the initial publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time.<p>The added chapters contain (1) a crisp condensation of all the propositions asserted in the original book, including Brooks' central argument in The Mythical Man-Month: that large programming projects suffer management problems different from small ones due to the division of labor; that the conceptual integrity of the product is therefore critical; and that it is difficult but possible to achieve this unity; (2) Brooks' view of these propositions a generation later; (3) a reprint of his classic 1986 paper \"No Silver Bullet\"; and (4) today's thoughts on the 1986 assertion, \"There will be no silver bullet within ten years.\"</p>",

For there is a signal beacon inside the pod, and even now a Dalek ship is closing in...",

Meanwhile, the Eighth Doctor's own investigations lead him to believe the Jax are not extinct after all.<br /><br />Cut off from the TARDIS, separated from his companion and pursued for murder, the Doctor discovers Kursaal hides a terrible secret \u2014 and that Sam is being affected by events more than anyone would guess...",

Only when they enter the house do they suspect things are not what they seem.<br /><br />How far-reaching is the strange power of a secret society almost 700 years old, and how is it linked to the mysterious Station Nine? And what is the significance of a series of paintings that drove a man to suicide?<br /><br />From thirteenth-century England to the former Soviet Union, from the United States to the cold wastes of space, the various strands of a complex plan come together and threaten to engulf the world in a nightmare of nuclear destruction...<br /><br /><i>This novel is another in the series of adventures featuring the Eighth Doctor and Sam.</i>",

But the controlling computer seems to be malfunctioning, and the viability of the whole planet hangs in the balance -- along with countless thousands of lives.<br /><br />Arriving at Hirath\u2019s control base, the Doctor and Sam are soon separated and trapped on the dying planet. While Sam becomes the focus of attention in a barren penal settlement, the Doctor discovers the secret of Hirath\u2019s unique condition - just as a race of hideous bloodthirsty alien creatures arrive in force to reclaim it.<br /><br />Caught up in a desperate struggle for survival, it seems time has run out for every living creature on Hirath - not least Sam and the Doctor...",

Rescued from an out-of-control spaceship, she finds herself on a tiny moon which is the only known source of dreamstone, a mysterious crystalline substance that can preserve your dreams -- or give you nightmares.<br /><br />Pitched into the middle of a conflict between the mining company extracting dreamstone and ecological protesters, Sam thinks it\u2019s easy to decide who the good guys are -- until people start dying, and the killers seem to be the same species as some of her new friends.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Doctor has tracked Sam down, but before he can reach her he\u2019s co-opted by the Dreamstone Mining Company and their sinister military advisers. Suddenly, it\u2019s war -- and the Doctor is forced to fight against what he believes in. He alone suspects that dreamstone isn\u2019t what it appears to be. But nobody\u2019s listening - and nobody could dream who the real enemy is...",

An artificial planetoid, Micawber's World, is hosting the intergalactic Olympic Games, and athletes from all the worlds in the Galactic Federation are arriving to take part. But when the Doctor and Sam arrive, the murders soon begin.<p>The Doctor finds himself drafted in to examine some bizarre new drugs that claim to enhance the natural potential of the competing athletes. But what is their real purpose? Why are members of the Security Forces disappearing randomly? And just why is Chase Carrington, manufacturer of the drug, so protective of his company's secrets?</p><p>Watching and waiting, at the very heart of Micawber's World, are a race of parasites the Doctor has fought before. The Wirrrn have come to the Milky Way from Andromeda, determined to spread their seed throughout a whole new galaxy, and it seems to Sam that the Doctor's hands are too full to pay their threat full attention.</p><p>This is another in the series of adventures featuring the 8th Doctor and Sam which reintroduces the Wirrrn from the 1975 television adventure The Ark in Space.</p>",

    "description": "With the humor of Bridget Jones and the vitality of Augusten Burroughs, Julie Powell recounts how she conquered every recipe in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking and saved her soul!<br /><br />Julie Powell is 30-years-old, living in a rundown apartment in Queens and working at a soul-sucking secretarial job that\u2019s going nowhere. She needs something to break the monotony of her life, and she invents a deranged assignment. She will take her mother's dog-eared copy of Julia Child's 1961 classic Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and she will cook all 524 recipes. In the span of one year. <br /><br />At first she thinks it will be easy. But as she moves from the simple Potage Parmentier (potato soup) into the more complicated realm of aspics and cr\u00e9pes, she realizes there\u2019s more to Mastering the Art of French Cooking than meets the eye. With Julia\u2019s stern warble always in her ear, Julie haunts the local butcher, buying kidneys and sweetbreads. She sends her husband on late-night runs for yet more butter and rarely serves dinner before midnight. She discovers how to mold the perfect Orange Bavarian, the trick to extracting marrow from bone, and the intense pleasure of eating liver. <br /><br />And somewhere along the line she realizes she has turned her kitchen into a miracle of creation and cuisine. She has eclipsed her life\u2019s ordinariness through spectacular humor, hysteria, and perseverance.",

In these high, green hills, the air is pure, the village is charming, and the people are generally lovable.<br /><br />Yet, Father Tim, the bachelor rector, wants something more. Enter a dog the size of a sofa who moves in and won't go away. Add an attractive neighbor who begins wearing a path through the hedge. Now, stir in a lovable but unloved boy, a mystifying jewel theft, and a secret that's sixty years old.<br /><br />Suddenly, Father Tim gets more than he bargained for. And readers get a rich, provincial comedy in which mysteries and miracles abound.<br /><br />- Includes new Readers' Guide to group discussion or personal reflection<br />- Includes a new introduction by Professor Dale Brown, a friend of Jan Karon.",

    "description": "With this brilliant novel about the surprises of destiny and the origins of fame, the critically acclaimed author of Golden Days (\"Extraordinary... a very, very important book\"-Los Angeles Times Book Review) and Making History (\"Radiant... exciting and imaginative\"-Cleveland Plain Dealer) firmly establishes her place as one of the preeminent chroniclers of our times.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br /><b>The Handyman</b> is the story of Bob Hampton, an aspiring young painter who has had to face the humbling fact that he doesn't know what to paint.\u00a0\u00a0And how are you supposed to be an artist in this world if you don't have a vision? Bob trades in his artist's palette for a minivan full of house paints, hammers, and nails, and sets about earning a little cash as a handyman.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br />Although he turns out to be very bad at fixing the things he's hired to fix, Bob demonstrates quite a knack for fixing the lives of the people around him. In the midst of his jerry-built repairs and inspired home improvements, Bob meets an extraordinary cast of characters--rendered in all their delightful eccentricity and human frailty as only Carolyn See can-each of whom shows Bob the true scope of his own remarkable talent. There's Angela Landry, a housewife with far too much time on her hands, a sexpot of a stepdaughter, and a son in need of\u00a0\u00a0attention; Jamie Walker, whose allergy-prone and ADD-afflicted children keep a menagerie of scaly pets that far exceed Jamie's managerial skills; Valerie LeClerc, older, sadder, and certainly wiser than Bob; and Hank and Ben, who leave a narrow-minded Midwest only to find unremitting illness and isolation in the California of their dreams.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br />Replete with stunning images and all of Carolyn See's trademark humor and wisdom, <b>The Handyman</b> depicts the countless ways in which our lives are intertwined and the profound effects we can have on one another. It is the kind of surprising and miraculously uplifting novel we have come to expect from the woman Diane Johnson has called \"one of our most important writers.\"<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "<strong>A vibrant collection of essays on the cosmos from the nation's best-known astrophysicist. \"One of today's best popularizers of science.\" <em>\u2014Kirkus Reviews.</em></strong><br /><br />Loyal readers of the monthly \"Universe\" essays in<em> Natural History</em> magazine have long recognized Neil deGrasse Tyson's talent for guiding them through the mysteries of the cosmos with stunning clarity and almost childlike enthusiasm. Here, Tyson compiles his favorite essays across a myriad of cosmic topics. <br /><br />The title essay introduces readers to the physics of black holes by explaining the gory details of what would happen to your body if you fell into one. \"Holy Wars\" examines the needless friction between science and religion in the context of historical conflicts. \"The Search for Life in the Universe\" explores astral life from the frontiers of astrobiology. And \"Hollywood Nights\" assails the movie industry's feeble efforts to get its night skies right. <br /><br />Known for his ability to blend content, accessibility, and humor, Tyson is a natural teacher who simplifies some of the most complex concepts in astrophysics while simultaneously sharing his infectious excitement about our universe.",

    "description": "Empirically proving that -- no matter where you are -- kids wanna rock, this is Chuck Klosterman's hilarious memoir of growing up as a shameless metalhead in Wyndmere, North Dakotoa (population: 498). With a voice like Ace Frehley's guitar, Klosterman hacks his way through hair-band history, beginning with that fateful day in 1983 when his older brother brought home M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's <i>Shout at the Devil.</i> The fifth-grade Chuck wasn't quite ready to rock -- his hair was too short and his farm was too quiet -- but he still found a way to bang his nappy little head. Before the journey was over, he would slow-dance to Poison, sleep innocently beneath satanic pentagrams, lust for Lita Ford, and get ridiculously intellectual about Guns N' Roses. C'mon and feel his noize.",

It won the Pulitzer Prize in 2005.<br /><br />Prize-winning journalist Steve Coll has spent years reporting from the Middle East, accessed previously classified government files and interviewed senior US officials and foreign spymasters. Here he gives the full inside story of the CIA's covert funding of an Islamic jihad against Soviet forces in Afghanistan, explores how this sowed the seeds of Bin Laden's rise, traces how he built his global network and brings to life the dramatic battles within the US government over national security. Above all, he lays bare American intelligence's continual failure to grasp the rising threat of terrorism in the years leading to 9/11 - and its devastating consequences.",

Newson is not the only member of the Class of take back '88 who has been raking over the ashes of the past. As his old class begins to reassemble in cyberspace, the years slip away and old feuds and passions burn hot once more.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back in the present, Newson's life is no less complicated. He is secretly in love with Natasha, his lovely but very attached sergeant, and failing comprehensively to solve a series of baffling and peculiarly gruesome murders. A school reunion is planned and as history begins to repeat itself, the past crashes headlong into the present. Neither will ever be the same again.<br /><br /><br />In <i>Past Mortem</i>, Ben Elton - previous winner of The Crime Writers' Association Gold Dagger Award for <i>Popcorn</i> - delivers both a heart-stopping thriller and a killer comic romance.",

    "description": "Open source provides the competitive advantage in the Internet Age. According to the August Forrester Report, 56 percent of IT managers interviewed at Global 2,500 companies are already using some type of open source software in their infrastructure and another 6 percent will install it in the next two years. This revolutionary model for collaborative software development is being embraced and studied by many of the biggest players in the high-tech industry, from Sun Microsystems to IBM to Intel.<br /><br /><i>The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar</i> is a must for anyone who cares about the future of the computer industry or the dynamics of the information economy. Already, billions of dollars have been made and lost based on the ideas in this book. Its conclusions will be studied, debated, and implemented for years to come. According to Bob Young, \"This is Eric Raymond's great contribution to the success of the open source revolution, to the adoption of Linux-based operating systems, and to the success of open source users and the companies that supply them.\"<br /><br />The interest in open source software development has grown enormously in the past year. This revised and expanded hardback edition includes new material on open source developments in 1999 and 2000. Raymond's clear and effective writing style accurately describing the benefits of open source software has been key to its success. With major vendors creating acceptance for open source within companies, independent vendors will become the open source story in 2001.",

    "description": "The American Empire has grown too fast, and the fault lines at home are stressed to the breaking point. The war of words between Right and Left has collapsed into a shooting war, though most people just want to be left alone. <br /><br />The battle rages between the high-technology weapons on one side, and militia foot-soldiers on the other, devastating the cities, and overrunning the countryside. But the vast majority, who only want the killing to stop and the nation to return to more peaceful days, have technology, weapons and strategic geniuses of their own. <br /><br />When the American dream shatters into violence, who can hold the people and the government together? And which side will you be on?<br /><br />Orson Scott Card is a master storyteller, who has earned millions of fans and reams of praise for his previous science fiction and fantasy novels. Now he steps a little closer to the present day with this chilling look at a near future scenario of a new American Civil War.",

    "description": "America's black market is much larger than we realize, and it affects us all deeply, whether or not we smoke pot, rent a risqu\u00e9 video, or pay our kid's nannies in cash. In Reefer Madness the best-selling author of Fast Food Nation turns his exacting eye on the underbelly of the American marketplace and its far-reaching influence on our society. Exposing three American mainstays \u2014 pot, porn, and illegal immigrants \u2014 Eric Schlosser shows how the black market has burgeoned over the past several decades. He also draws compelling parallels between underground and overground: how tycoons and gangsters rise and fall, how new technology shapes a market, how government intervention can reinvigorate black markets as well as mainstream ones, and how big business learns \u2014 and profits \u2014 from the underground. <br /><br />Reefer Madness is a powerful investigation that illuminates the shadow economy and the culture that casts that shadow.<br />(back cover)",

Here he is cared for by Matsu, a reticent housekeeper and a master gardener. Over the course of a remarkable year, Stephen learns Matsu's secret and gains not only physical strength, but also profound spiritual insight. Matsu is a samurai of the soul, a man devoted to doing good and finding beauty in a cruel and arbitrary world, and Stephen is a noble student, learning to appreciate Matsu's generous and nurturing way of life and to love Matsu's soul-mate, gentle Sachi, a woman afflicted with leprosy. <br />",

    "description": "<b>Is it possible to grow up while getting younger?</b><br /><br />Welcome to Elsewhere. It is warm, with a breeze, and the beaches are marvelous. It\u2019s quiet and peaceful. You can\u2019t get sick or any older. Curious to see new paintings by Picasso? Swing by one of Elsewhere\u2019s museums. Need to talk to someone about your problems? Stop by Marilyn Monroe\u2019s psychiatric practice. \u00a0Elsewhere is where fifteen-year-old Liz Hall ends up, after she has died. It is a place so like Earth, yet completely different. Here Liz will age backward from the day of her death until she becomes a baby again and returns to Earth. But Liz wants to turn sixteen, not fourteen again. She wants to get her driver\u2019s license. She wants to graduate from high school and go to college. And now that she\u2019s dead, Liz is being forced to live a life she doesn\u2019t want with a grandmother she has only just met. And it is not going well. How can Liz let go of the only life she has ever known and embrace a new one? Is it possible that a life lived in reverse is no different from a life lived forward? This moving, often funny book about grief, death, and loss will stay with the reader long after the last page is turned.\u00a0<br /><i>Elsewhere</i> is a 2006 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.",

Instinct proves reliable. A murderous sociopath, Edgler Foreman Vess, has entered the house, intent on killing everyone inside. A self-proclaimed \"homicidal adventurer,\" Vess lives only to satisfy all appetites as they arise, to immerse himself in sensation, to live without fear, remorse or limits, to live with \"intensity.\" Chyna is trapped in his deadly orbit. <br /><br />Chyna is a survivor, toughened by a lifelong struggle for safety and self-respect. Now she will be tested as never before. At first her sole aim is to get out alive--until, by chance, she learns the identity of Vess's next intended victim, a faraway innocent only she can save. Driven by a newly discovered thirst for meaning beyond mere self-preservation, Chyna musters every inner resource she has to save an endangered girl...as moment by moment, the terrifying threat of Edgler Foreman Vess intensifies.",

    "description": "Dean Koontz's unique talent for writing terrifying thrillers with a heart and soul is nowhere more evident than in this latest suspense masterpiece that pits one man against the ultimate deadline. If there were speed limits for the sheer pulse-racing excitement allowed in one novel, \"Velocity\" would break them all. Get ready for the ride of your life. <br /><br />Bill Wiles is an easygoing, hardworking guy who leads a quiet, ordinary life. But that is about to change. One evening, after his usual eight-hour bartending shift, he finds a typewritten note under the windshield wiper of his car. <br /><br /><blockquote>\n  <i>\"If you don't take this note to the police and get them involved, I will kill a lovely blond schoolteacher. If you do take this note to the police, I will instead kill an elderly woman active in charity work. You have four hours to decide. The choice is yours.\"</i>\n</blockquote><br /><br />It seems like a sick joke, and Bill's friend on the police force, Lanny Olson, thinks so too. His advice to Bill is to go home and forget about it. Besides, what could they do even if they took the note seriously? No crime has actually been committed. But less than twenty-four hours later, a young blond schoolteacher is found murdered, and it's Bill's fault: he didn't convince the police to get involved. Now he's got another note, another deadline, another ultimatum...and two new lives hanging in the balance. <br /><br />Suddenly Bill's average, seemingly innocuous life takes on the dimensions and speed of an accelerating nightmare. Because the notes are coming faster, the deadlines growing tighter, and the killer becoming bolder and crueler with every communication--until Bill is isolated with the terrifying knowledge that he alone has the power of life and death over a psychopath's innocent victims. Until the struggle between good and evil is intensely personal. Until the most chilling words of all are: <i>\"The choice is yours.\"</i>",

    "description": "A man, a donkey, and a very long walk: Moore's latest European adventure (after French Revolutions and others) finds him embarking on an ages-old physical and spiritual pilgrimage across Spain to the famed cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Moore entertains with his snappy one-liners and skewed views of the locals, his fellow pilgrims and his own reasons for undertaking the camino. Against advice to the contrary, he pursues his search for a donkey to accompany him, which \"upgraded his camino from big walk to revelatory voyage of self-examination.\" Moore shines in detailing \"Tim and Shinto's Excellent Adventure\": during the day, he accumulates \"clicks\" (kilometers) and cajoles Shinto across bridges, grates and roads; afternoons and evenings are spent searching for donkey-friendly lodgings (and encountering a share of slammed doors). Fellow pilgrims (the \"Baroness von Munchausen\"; \"New Mexico Joe\") get full portraits between details of communal living and eating, and the sordid intimacies of the shared bathroom. His sections on the pilgrimage's history and the towns he passes, however, are dry in comparison to his anecdotal asides and may only appeal to history buffs or those who've traveled this route themselves. While Moore may not have found his \"inner Tim,\" he does take readers on an entertaining, unusual adventure.<br />Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

    "description": "A comet the color of blood and flame cuts across the sky. Two great leaders\u2014Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon\u2014who hold sway over an age of enforced peace are dead, victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns. Six factions struggle for control of a divided land and the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, preparing to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. <br /><br />It is a tale in which brother plots against brother and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, victory may go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel...and the coldest hearts. For when kings clash, the whole land trembles.<br /><br />Here is the second volume in George R.R. Martin magnificent cycle of novels that includes <i>A Game of Thrones</i> and <i>A Storm of Swords</i>. As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R.R. Martin stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.",

    "description": "Here is the third volume in George R. R. Martin's magnificent cycle of novels that includes A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings. As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R. R. Martin's stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction. <br />A Storm of Swords <br />Of the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King's Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world.... <br />But as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others--a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in averitable storm of swords. . . \"From the Trade Paperback edition.\"",

On Richard's first night there a fellow traveller slits his wrists, leaving Richard a map to \"the Beach\".<br /><br />The Beach is a legend among young travellers in Asia: white as sands circling a lagoon hidden from the sea, coral gardens and freshwater falls surrounded by jungle.

This bestselling classic is both an unparalleled reference on the practices and philosophies of Witchcraft and a guide to the life-affirming ways in which readers can turn to the Goddess to deepen their sense of personal pride, develop their inner power, and integrate mind, body, and spirit. Starhawk's brilliant, comprehensive overview of the growth, suppression, and modern-day re-emergence of Wicca as a Goddess-worshipping religion has left an indelible mark on the feminist spiritual consciousness.<br /><br />In a new introduction, Starhawk reveals the ways in which Goddess religion and the practice of ritual have adapted and developed over the last twenty years, and she reflects on the ways in which these changes have influenced and enhanced her original ideas. In the face of an ever-changing world, this invaluable spiritual guidebook is more relevant than ever.",

With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned\u2014a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible.<br /><br />When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell\u2019s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.",

    "description": "A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year<br /> Winner of the Lannan Literary Fiction Award<br /> Winner of the Guardian Fiction Award<br /> \u00a0<br /> In 1940 a boy bursts from the mud of a war-torn Polish city, where he has buried himself to hide from the soldiers who murdered his family. His name is Jakob Beer. He is only seven years old. And although by all rights he should have shared the fate of the other Jews in his village, he has not only survived but been rescued by a Greek geologist, who does not recognize the boy as human until he begins to cry. With this electrifying image, Anne Michaels ushers us into her rapturously acclaimed novel of loss, memory, history, and redemption.<br /> \u00a0<br /> As Michaels follows Jakob across two continents, she lets us witness his transformation from a half-wild casualty of the Holocaust to an artist who extracts meaning from its abyss. Filled with mysterious symmetries and rendered in heart-stopping prose, <i>Fugitive Pieces</i> is a triumphant work, a book that should not so much be read as it should be surrendered to.",

Like thousands of people all over England, they were lovers and living together out of wedlock. To Chanda\u2019s family, however, the disgrace was unforgivable. Perhaps enough so as to warrant murder.As he explores the disappearance and its aftermath through the eyes of Jugnu\u2019s worldly older brother, Shamas, and his devout wife, Kaukab, Nadeem Aslam creates a closely observed and affecting portrait of people whose traditions threaten to bury them alive. The result is a tour de force, intimate, affecting, tragic and suspenseful.",

    "description": "Melanie and Fran are two charmingly wisecracking young Londoners who simply can't believe it when their old schoolfriend Amanda, Satan's own PR agent, manages to get herself hitched to a laird (Scottish for lord). Who cares that Fraser McConnel has worn the same ratty Converse sneakers for years and that his castle is really a pile of rubble -- all the social -climbing queen of preen cares about is the title she'll soon have. She's got Fraser by the nuptials, and she has no intention of letting go. Gentle, decent Fraser is completely innocent Amanda's wiles, so Mel and Fran, still smarting from Amanda's evil misdeeds years ago in school, join forces with Fraser's adorable younger brother Angus to sabotage the mismatch of the century. Between fighting off the attentions of a love-crazed accountant, dealing with a ne'er-do-well rockstar wannabe boyfriend, keeping Fran's deadly maneuvers with the opposite sex under control, finding herself at the heart of a bachelor party controversy, consuminglarge quantities of alcohol, and throwing out hysterical barbs that would make Oscar Wilde proud, Mel will break some hearts and win over those of readers by the score...all of whom are certain to enjoy the mayhem -- and hilarious mishaps -- in store in \"Amanda's Wedding!\"",

    "description": "Within the temple of Abydos, an acacia tree is dying...<br /><br />And through it, all Egypt is threatened. For this tree sprang forth from the tomb of the god Osiris, as proof of his triumph over death. Watered and fed on milk by the priests of the temple, the acacia is the guarantee of happiness on earth. Its withering means that great powers are conspiring to destroy Egypt.<br /><br />The pharaoh Sesotris III immediately joins battle against the invisible enemy who wishes to lead Egypt to her doom. But within the pharaoh's closest circle hides a traitor, a man who dreams of unlimited power a man who will sell himself to the powers of darkness in order to achieve his aim.<br /><br />A young apprentice scribe, Iker, becomes an unwilling player in this mystery. Kidnapped by sailors who refer darkly to a 'state secret', Iker does not know who is trying to kill him, nor indeed who is trying to protect him. Haunted by a vision of a beautiful priestess, Iker senses that someone is guiding or manipulating him; that he has set out on a path whose end he does not know.<br /><br />Will the two of them, Iker and Sesostris, the weak man and the strong, suceed in preventing Osiris dying for the last time - and suceed in saving Egypt?",

    "description": "This is the exquisitely tender story of love that beats desperately against the taboos of Oriental tradition. With great sensitivity, Gibran describes his passion as a youth for Selma Karamy, the girl of Beirut who first unfolded to him the secrets of love. But it is a love that is doomed by a social convention which forces Selma into marriage with another man. Portraying the happiness and infinite sorrow of his relationship with Selma, Gibran at the same time probes the spiritual meaning of human existence with profound compassion. **Lightning Print On Demand Title",

And, at twenty-seven, they decide they've had enough crap boyfriends and they're ready for crap husbands - all they have to do is find them. So where better than Las Vegas itself, where the air is 70% oxygen and 30% confetti?<br /><br />But as they abandon their increasingly complicated lives in sleepy Devon for the eye-popping brilliance of Las Vegas, their groom-grabbing plan starts to look less than foolproof. And those niggling problems they thought they'd left behind - like Izzy's fianc\u00e9 and the alarming reappearance of Jamie's first love - just won't go away...",

    "description": "An intense, passionate, and profoundly moving work, Flaubert's <i>November </i>explores the notions of desire and longing to most remarkable effect. Wrestling with the agony of loneliness, a young man withdraws deeper into himself, believing he has now reached the autumn of his life. His increasing hopelessness gives way to a yearning for romance\u2014surely the love of a woman can deliver him the purpose he so craves? Convinced of the truth of this, he visits Marie, a kindhearted prostitute\u2014yet Marie, too, is starved of love and longs for acceptance. Together, they form a tragic portrait of personal anguish, heralding the extraordinary outpouring of romantic longing found in Flaubert\u2019s later novels. Most famous for <i>Madame Bovary</i> and <i>Sentimental Education: The Story of a Young Man, </i>Gustave Flaubert is one of the undisputed masters of 19th-century fiction.",

We just call it \u201cThe Bug War.\" Everything up to then and still later were \"incidents,\" \"patrols,\" or \"police actions.\" However, you are just as dead if you buy the farm in an \"incident\" as you are if you buy it in a declared war...<br /><br />In one of Robert A. Heinlein\u2019s most controversial bestsellers, a recruit of the future goes through the toughest boot camp in the Universe\u2014and into battle with the Terran Mobile Infantry against mankind\u2019s most alarming enemy.<br />",

    "description": "One of the greatest of twentieth-century novelists and poets, D. H. Lawrence wrote and lived with a passionate intensity that shocked his contemporaries. Lawrence composed <i>Women in Love</i> while at the height of his powers, and indeed, in its blend of lyricism, psychological revelation, and an eroticism that is never very far from violence, it can still startle and even discomfit readers. In this story of two very unconventional sisters, Ursula and Gudrun Brangwen, and the men they love, Lawrence argues urgently for a new conjunction between man and woman as \"two pure beings, each constituting the freedom of the other.\" The ardent struggle of human souls coming into being, and into relationship with one another, is at the heart of <i>Women in Love</i>, and this wrenching, sometimes painful, thoroughly exhilarating process is brilliantly illuminated in Lawrence's masterpiece.",

    "description": "Featuring his world-famous masterpiece, \"Death in Venice,\" this new collection of Nobel laureate Thomas Mann's stories and novellas reveals his artistic evolution. In this new, widely acclaimed translation that restores the controversial passages that were cut out of the original English version, \"Death in Venice\" tells about a ruinous quest for love and beauty amid degenerating splendor. Gustav von Aschenbach, a successful but lonely author, travels to the Queen of the Adriatic in search of an elusive spiritual fulfillment that turns into his erotic doom. Spellbound by a beautiful Polish boy, he finds himself fettered to this hypnotic city of sun-drenched sensuality and eerie physical decay. Also included in this volume are eleven other stories by Mann: \"Tonio Kroger,\" \"Gladius Dei,\" \"The Blood of the Walsungs,\" \"The Will for Happiness,\" \"Little Herr Friedmann,\" \"Tobias Mindernickel,\" \"Little Lizzy,\" \"Tristan,\" \"The Starvelings,\" \"The Wunderkind,\" and \"Harsh Hour.\" All of the stories collected here display Mann's inimitable use of irony, his subtle characterizations, and superb, complex plots.",

    "description": "Paul Auster's <i>Hand to Mouth: A Chronicle of Early Failure</i> is a fascinating and often funny memoir about his early years as a writer struggling to be published, and to make enough money to survive. Leaving high school with \"itchy feet\" and refusing to play it safe, Auster avoided convention and the double life of steady office employment while writing. From the streets of New York City, Dublin, and Paris to a surreal adventure in a dusty village in Mexico, Auster's account of living on next to nothing introduces an unforgettable cast of characters while examining what it means to be a writer.",

    "description": "The extraordinary stories that brought the author a cult following.<br /><br />These are the stories of a young boy on the run, away from his past, hellbent towards an unknown future. Connected, they form a sometimes harrowing, sometimes bleakly funny, and often tender portrait of a complicated life. Like a modern-day Voltaire, LeRoy bounces his characters from adventure to adventure, each of them unyielding in the belief that the best of all possible worlds lies just around the next corner. Fresh, raw, and absolutely unforgettable, <i>The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things</i> has further established the acclaimed author of <i>Sarah</i> as one of the most compelling voices in contemporary fiction.",

    "description": "<i>Sarah </i>is the story of the prodigal son recast in the carnivalesque world of the highway truck stop and its environs. The narrator, an androgynous twelve year old boy, idolizes his mother Sarah, a \"lot lizard\", or truck-stop whore. He leaves the safety of the lot-a perversely idyllic kingdom ruled by Gladening Grateful Etc., a benevolent pimp who sent one of his boys to chef's school to cook gourmet meals at the truckstop diner-on a quest to become as famous as his mother. Adopting her name and sex, \"Sarah\" stumbles into dangerous and fantastic worlds pocketed away in the West Virginian wilds. He hitches a ride to the famous luck-restoring Jack-a-lope, is mistaken for a saint and must prove himself by walking on water. When he is captured by LeLoup, Glad's violent rival, \"Sarah\"'s life is all but over. Will he perish at the hands of LeLoup, or will \"Sarah\" find his way home?<br /><br />J.T. LeRoy has created a hauntingly memorable world, strangely reminiscent of Lewis Carroll's Wonderland. Heartwarming as it is bizarre, beautiful and stunningly original, Sarah heralds the debut of an inimitable new talent.",

    "description": "<i>Middlesex</i> tells the breathtaking story of Calliope Stephanides, and three generations of the Greek-American Stephanides family, who travel from a tiny village overlooking Mount Olympus in Asia Minor to Prohibition-era Detroit, witnessing its glory days as the Motor City and the race riots of 1967 before moving out to the tree-lined streets of suburban Grosse Pointe, Michigan. To understand why Calliope is not like other girls, she has to uncover a guilty family secret, and the astonishing genetic history that turns Callie into Cal, one of the most audacious and wondrous narrators in contemporary fiction. Lyrical and thrilling, <i>Middlesex</i> is an exhilarating reinvention of the American epic.",

    "description": "<i>An alternate cover edition can be found <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31332006-sculpting-in-time\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</i><br /><br />Andrey Tarkovsky, the genius of modern Russian cinema--hailed by Ingmar Bergman as \"the most important director of our time\"--died an exile in Paris in December 1986. In Sculpting in Time, he has left his artistic testament, a remarkable revelation of both his life and work. Since Ivan's Childhood won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1962, the visionary quality and totally original and haunting imagery of Tarkovsky's films have captivated serious movie audiences all over the world, who see in his work a continuation of the great literary traditions of nineteenth-century Russia. Many critics have tried to interpret his intensely personal vision, but he himself always remained inaccessible.<br /><br />In Sculpting in Time, Tarkovsky sets down his thoughts and his memories, revealing for the first time the original inspirations for his extraordinary films--Ivan's Childhood, Andrey Rublyov, Solaris, The Mirror, Stalker, Nostalgia, and The Sacrifice. He discusses their history and his methods of work, he explores the many problems of visual creativity, and he sets forth the deeply autobiographical content of part of his oeuvre--most fascinatingly in The Mirror and Nostalgia. The closing chapter on The Sacrifice, dictated in the last weeks of Tarkovsky's life, makes the book essential reading for those who already know or who are just discovering his magnificent work.",

In an era of escalating tensions in the Middle East, his defiant moral voice and eloquent account of a national struggle for freedom and democracy against the overwhelming backdrop of U.S. military hegemony fills a crucial gap in our understanding of this country.<br /><br /><br />",

Her fresh perspective on present-day Iran provides a rare insight into this rich culture alive with artistic expression but virtually unknown to most Americans. <br /><br />Keshavarz introduces readers to two modern Iranian women writers whose strong and articulate voices belie the stereotypical perception of Iranian women as voiceless victims in a country of villains. She follows with a lively critique of the recent best-seller <i>Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books</i>, which epitomizes what Keshavarz calls the \"New Orientalist narrative,\" a view marred by stereotype and prejudice more often tied to current geopolitical conflicts than to an understanding of Iran. <br /><br />Blending in firsthand glimpses of her own life--from childhood memories in 1960s Shiraz to her present life as a professor in America--Keshavarz paints a portrait of Iran depicting both cultural depth and intellectual complexity. With a scholar's expertise and a poet's hand, she helps amplify the powerful voices of contemporary Iranians and leads readers toward a deeper understanding of the country's past and present.<br /><br />In a direct, frank, and intimate exploration of Iranian literature and society, scholar, teacher, and poet Fatemeh Keshavarz challenges popular perceptions of Iran as a society bereft of vitality and joy.

    "description": "Outraged by the sexual perversity of this one-act tragedy, Great Britain's Lord Chamberlain banned <i>Salom\u00e9</i> from the national stage. Symbolist poets and writers \u2014 St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 and Maurice Maeterlinck among them \u2014 defended the play's literary brilliance. Beyond its notoriety, the drama's haunting poetic imagery, biblical cadences, and febrile atmosphere have earned it a reputation as a masterpiece of the Aesthetic movement of <i>fin de si\u00e8cle</i> England.<br />Written originally in French in 1892, this sinister tale of a woman scorned and her vengeance was translated into English by Lord Alfred Douglas. The play inspired some of Aubrey Beardsley's finest illustrations, and an abridged version served as the text for Strauss' renowned opera of the same name. This volume reprints the complete text of the first English edition, published in 1894, and also includes \"A Note on Salom\u00e9\" by Robert Ross, Wilde's lifelong friend and literary executor. Students, lovers of literature and drama, and admirers of Oscar Wilde and his remarkable literary gifts will rejoice in this inexpensive edition.",

    "description": "All children mythologize their birth...So begins the prologue of reclusive author Vida Winter's collection of stories, which are as famous for the mystery of the missing thirteenth tale as they are for the delight and enchantment of the twelve that do exist. <br /><br />The enigmatic Winter has spent six decades creating various outlandish life histories for herself -- all of them inventions that have brought her fame and fortune but have kept her violent and tragic past a secret. Now old and ailing, she at last wants to tell the truth about her extraordinary life. She summons biographer Margaret Lea, a young woman for whom the secret of her own birth, hidden by those who loved her most, remains an ever-present pain. Struck by a curious parallel between Miss Winter's story and her own, Margaret takes on the commission. <br /><br />As Vida disinters the life she meant to bury for good, Margaret is mesmerized. It is a tale of gothic strangeness featuring the Angelfield family, including the beautiful and willful Isabelle, the feral twins Adeline and Emmeline, a ghost, a governess, a topiary garden and a devastating fire. <br /><br />Margaret succumbs to the power of Vida's storytelling but remains suspicious of the author's sincerity. She demands the truth from Vida, and together they confront the ghosts that have haunted them while becoming, finally, transformed by the truth themselves. <br /><br />The Thirteenth Tale is a love letter to reading, a book for the feral reader in all of us, a return to that rich vein of storytelling that our parents loved and that we loved as children. Diane Setterfield will keep you guessing, make you wonder, move you to tears and laughter and, in the end, deposit you breathless yet satisfied back upon the shore of your everyday life.",

    "description": "Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made <i>The Tipping Point</i> a classic, <i>Blink</i> changes the way you'll understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? <br /><br />In <i>Blink</i> we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \"thin-slicing\" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.",

Writing in the tradition of Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, Marilynne Robinson's beautiful, spare, and spiritual prose allows \"even the faithless reader to feel the possibility of transcendent order\" (<i>Slate</i>). In the luminous and unforgettable voice of Congregationalist minister John Ames, Gilead reveals the human condition and the often unbearable beauty of an ordinary life.<br /></div>",

And while 1984 has come and gone, his dystopian vision of a government that will do anything to control the narrative is timelier than ever...<br /><br />\"<i>The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.</i>\"<br /><br />Winston Smith toes the Party line, rewriting history to satisfy the demands of the Ministry of Truth. With each lie he writes, Winston grows to hate the Party that seeks power for its own sake and persecutes those who dare to commit thoughtcrimes. But as he starts to think for himself, Winston can't escape the fact that Big Brother is always watching...<br /><br />A startling and haunting vision of the world, <i>1984 </i>is so powerful that it is completely convincing from start to finish. No one can deny the influence of this novel, its hold on the imaginations of multiple generations of readers, or the resiliency of its admonitions--a legacy that seems only to grow with the passage of time.<b>Includes a foreword by Thomas Pynchon</b>",

Maybe you've found the story of Lucrezia Borgia a bitter pill to swallow, or wanted the straight skinny on corpulent King Henry the Eighth, but you haven't the stomach for stuffy history books. Now these and twenty-two more of history's most famous personages are brought brilliantly to life, in this collection of unfailingly accurate yet undeniably hilarious biographies. You'll laugh while you learn about the very real people behind the legendary names, including why Montezuma was so vengeful, and why Catherine was so Great. You'll even finally lay to rest the rumor that Charlemagne was called \"Chuck\" by his friends.<br />",

Holmes, master of disguise, reasoned logically to deduce clients' background from their first appearance. He used fingerprints, chemical analysis, and forensic science.\n    \n    The majority of the stories were first published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>  accumulated to four novels and fifty-six short stories set 1880-1914.\n    \n    All but four stories are narrated by Holmes's friend and biographer, Dr John H. Watson; two are narrated by Holmes himself (<i>The Blanched Soldier</i> and <i>The Lion's Mane</i>) and two others are written in the third person (<i>The Mazarin Stone</i> and <i>His Last Bow</i>). In two stories (<i>The Musgrave Ritual</i> and <i>The Gloria Scott</i>), Holmes tells Watson the main story from his memories, while Watson becomes the narrator of the frame story. The first and fourth novels, <i>A Study in Scarlet</i> and <i>The Valley of Fear</i>, each include long omniscient narration of events unknown to Holmes or Watson.",

When her husband, Ted Hughes, first brought this collection to life, it garnered worldwide acclaim, though it wasn't the draft Sylvia had wanted her readers to see. This facsimile edition restores, for the first time, Plath's original manuscript\u2014including handwritten notes\u2014and her own selection and arrangement of poems. This edition also includes in facsimile the complete working drafts of her poem \"Ariel,\" which provide a rare glimpse into the creative process of a beloved writer. This publication introduces a truer version of Plath's works, and will no doubt alter her legacy forever.",

    "description": "Formerly Poet Laureate to Queen Elizabeth II, the late Ted Hughes (1930-98) is recognized as one of the few contemporary poets whose work has mythic scope and power. And few episodes in postwar literature have the legendary stature of Hughes's romance with, and marriage to, the great American poet Sylvia Plath.<br /><br />The poems in <i>Birthday Letters</i> are addressed (with just two exceptions) to Plath, and were written over a period of more than twenty-five years, the first a few years after her suicide in 1963. Some are love letters, others haunted recollections and ruminations. In them, Hughes recalls his and Plath's time together, drawing on the powerful imagery of his work--animal, vegetable, mythological--as well as on Plath's famous verse.<br /><br />Countless books have discussed the subject of this intense relationship from a necessary distance, but this volume--at last--offers us Hughes's own account. Moreover, it is a truly remarkable collection of poems in its own right.",

    "description": "The dazzling novel that established Walker Percy as one of the major voices in Southern literature is now available for the first time in Vintage paperback. The Moviegoer is Binx Bolling, a young New Orleans stockbroker who surveys the world with the detached gaze of a Bourbon Street dandy even as he yearns for a spiritual redemption he cannot bring himself to believe in. On the eve of his thirtieth birthday, he occupies himself dallying with his secretaries and going to movies, which provide him with the \"treasurable moments\" absent from his real life. But one fateful Mardi Gras, Binx embarks on a hare-brained quest that outrages his family, endangers his fragile cousin Kate, and sends him reeling through the chaos of New Orleans' French Quarter. Wry and wrenching, rich in irony and romance, The Moviegoer is a genuine American classic.",

    "description": "Set in the Igbo heartland of eastern Nigeria, one of Africa's best-known writers describes the conflict between old and new in its most poignant aspect: the personal struggle between father and son.<br /><br />Ezeulu, the headstrong chief priest of the god Ulu, is worshipped by the six villages of Umuaro. But his authority is increasingly under threat\u2014from rivals within his tribe, from functionaries of the colonial government, and even from his own family members. Yet he believes himself to be untouchable: surely he is an arrow in the bow of his God? Armed with this belief, he is prepared to lead his people, even if it is towards their own destruction. But his people will not be dominated so easily.<br /><br />Spare and powerful, Arrow of God is an unforgettable portrayal of the loss of faith, and the downfall of a man in a society forever altered by colonialism.",

    "description": "The Crash of '79 is a book so real that its plot reads like today's headlines. The central figure is that world traveler, playboy, despot, and winter-sports enthusiast His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Iran, whose grandiose and megalomaniacal dreams, nurtured in secret and financed by oil money, engulf the lives of Erdman's characters, each of whom, unknowingly, is contributing to the event that will bring about the Crash of '79 and the demise of the industrial West.<br /><br />Bill Hitchcock, the hero, is a successful banker, divorced skirt-chaser, confirmed cynic and financial genius. It is Hitchcock whom the Saudi Arabians pick to manage their vast hoard of accumulated oil profits and to fire a warning shot across the bows of the Western financial community. And no sooner has Hitchcock sat down at his desk in Riyadh than he learns just how precariously balanced the Western world's financial system really is.<br /><br />Before long Hitchcock is wheeling and dealing at the highest levels of government, while pursuing Ursula Hartmann, beautiful Swiss daughter of one of the world's most distinguished nuclear scientists. Through her he becomes aware that the Saudi's, for all their oil and money, have a problem of their own - the Shah or Iran's ambition to control the entire Middle East and its precious oil...",

    "description": "Hermann Hesse's classic novel <i>Siddhartha</i> has delighted, inspired, and influenced generations of readers, writers, and thinkers. Though set in a place and time far removed from the Germany of 1922, the year of the book's debut, the novel is infused with the sensibilities of Hesse's time, synthesizing disparate philosophies Eastern religions, Jungian archetypes, Western individualism into a unique vision of life as expressed through one man's search for meaning.<br /><br />It is the story of the quest of Siddhartha, a wealthy Indian Brahmin who casts off a life of privilege and comfort to seek spiritual fulfillment and wisdom. On his journey, Siddhartha encounters wandering ascetics, Buddhist monks, and successful merchants, as well as a courtesan named Kamala and a simple ferryman who has attained enlightenment. Traveling among these people and experiencing life's vital passages, love, work, friendship, and fatherhood. Siddhartha discovers that true knowledge is guided from within.<br /><br />Susan Bernofsky's magnificent new translation brings out Hesse's inspired lyricism and his elegant, melodious cadences, illuminating the novel's universal themes and timeless wisdom about the human condition.<br /><br />This original Modern Library edition includes a lively new Introduction by Tom Robbins and a glossary of Indian terms.",

    "description": "<i>Steppenwolf</i> is a poetical self-portrait of a man who felt himself to be half-human and half-wolf. This Faust-like and magical story is evidence of Hesse's searching philosophy and extraordinary sense of humanity as he tells of the humanization of a middle-aged misanthrope. Yet this novel can also be seen as a plea for rigorous self-examination and an indictment of the intellectual hypocrisy of the period. As Hesse himself remarked, \"Of all my books <i>Steppenwolf</i> is the one that was more often and more violently misunderstood than any other\".",

    "description": "Her first new book in over 10 years. Bedford is back with what will surely (she says) be her last, and the moving culmination of a story that began in 1956 (when Legacy pubbed in the UK).<br /><br />Acclaim, acclaim, and acclaim. Sybille Bedford is, simply put, one of the finest writers of her generation. None other than notoriously hard-to-satisfy Bruce Chatwin asserted that \"when the history of modern prose in English comes to be written, Mrs. Bedford will have to appear in any list of its most dazzling practitioners.\"<br /><br />Comparisons. While not yet as big a name in the U.S. as her talent would suggest, Bedford ranks with the elder states(wo)men of contemporary literature. Think of her in the same breath as Shirley Hazzard, Penelope Fitzgerald, Joan Didion, Anita Brookner, and Cynthia Ozick.<br /><br />Another chance to rediscover a long-lost great. The past few years the literary world has witnessed a number of spectacular career rebirths. Paula Fox, e.g., emerged after a long silence with the NBCC finalist Borrowed Finery and stacks of rave reviews. In some cases, this reassessment has even worked posthumously--as seen in the attention lavished on Rebecca West's Survivors in Mexico. Expect Bedford's Quicksands to be the next to get this royal treatment.<br /><br />The Counterpoint reissues. This book, very likely to be Bedford's last (she's 92), will also form the culmination of the Counterpoint reissues of the Bedford backlist. Look forward to the same crisp, classic packaging for this latest outing.<br /><br />",

    "description": "The year is 1967, and Rigby John Klusener, seventeen years old and finally leaving his home and family in Pocatello, Idaho, is on the highway with his thumb out and a flower behind his ear, headed for San Francisco. Now Is the Hour is the wondrous story of how Rigby John got to this point. It traces his gradual emancipation from the repressions of a strictly religious farming family and from the small-minded, bigoted community in which he has grown up during a time of explosive cultural change. Transforming this familiar journey from American Graffiti to On the Road into something rich and strange and hilarious is the persona of Rigby John himself. Intimately in touch with his fears, hesitantly awakening to his own sexuality, and palpably open to life's mysteries, Rigby John is a protagonist whom readers will fall in love with, root for, and be moved by.<br /><br />Now Is the Hour is a powerful, vastly entertaining story of self-awakening, of the complex bonds of family, and ultimately of America during a period of tremendous upheaval.",

Among Arthur's motley shipmates are Ford Prefect, a long-time friend and contributor to the The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy; Zaphod Beeblebrox, the three-armed, two-headed ex-president of the galaxy; Tricia McMilan, a fellow Earth refuge who's gone native (her name is Trillian now); and Marvin, who suffers nothing and no one gladly.<br /><br />Source: douglasadams.com",

It's as if Kafka has gotten hooked on the gumshoe game and penned his own ever-spiraling version.\" As a result of a strange phone call in the middle of the night, Quinn, a writer of detective stories, becomes enmeshed in a case more puzzling than any he might have written. Written with hallucinatory clarity, <i>City of Glass</i> combines dark humor with Hitchcock-like suspense. <p><i>Ghosts</i> and <i>The Locked Room</i> are the next two brilliant installments in Paul Auster's <i>The New York Trilogy</i>.</p>",

    "description": "Imagine being able to visit England--all of England--in a single weekend. Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, Stonehenge and Hadrian's Wall, Harrods, Manchester United Football Club, the Tower of London, and even the Royal Family all within easy distance of the each other, accessible, and, best of all, each one living up to an idealized version of itself. This fantasy Britain is the very real (and some would say very cynical) vision of Sir Jack Pitman, a monumentally egomaniacal mogul with a more than passing resemblance to modern-day buccaneers Sir Rupert Murdoch or Robert Maxwell: \"'We are not talking theme park,' he began. 'We are not talking heritage centre. We are not talking Disneyland, World's Fair, Festival of Britain, Legoland or Parc Asterix.'\" No indeed; Sir Jack proposes nothing less than to offer \"the thing itself,\" a re-creation of everything that adds up to <i>England</i> in the hearts and minds of tourists looking for an \"authentic\" experience. But where to locate such an enterprise? As Sir Jack points out, <blockquote> England, as the mighty William and many others have observed, is an island. Therefore, if we are serious, if we are seeking to offer <i>the thing itself</i>, we in turn must go in search of a precious whatsit set in a silver doodah. </blockquote> Soon the perfect whatsit is found: the Isle of Wight; and a small army of Sir Jack's forces are sent to lay siege to it. Swept up in the mayhem are Martha Cochrane, a thirtysomething consultant teetering on the verge of embittered middle age, and Paul Harrison, a younger man looking for an anchor in the world. The two first find each other, then trip over a skeleton in Sir Jack's closet that might prove useful to their careers but disastrous to their relationship. In the course of constructing this mad package-tour dystopia, Julian Barnes has a terrific time skewering postmodernism, the British, the press, the government, celebrity, and big business. At the same time his very funny novel offers a provocative meditation on the nature of identity, both individual and national, as the lines between the replica and <i>the thing itself</i> begin to blur. Readers of Barnes have learned to expect the unexpected, and once again he more than lives up to the promise in <i>England, England</i>. But then, that was only to be expected. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>",

    "description": "Joy Division's career has often been shrouded by myths. But the truth is surprisingly simple: over a period of several months, Joy Division transformed themselves from run-of-the-mill punk wannabes into the creators of one of the most atmospheric, disturbing, and influential debut albums ever recorded. Chris Ott carefully picks apart fact from fiction to show how Unknown Pleasures came into being, and how it still resonates so strongly today. EXCERPT The urgent, alien thwack of Stephen Morris' processed snare drum as it bounced from the left to right channel was so arresting in 1979, one could have listened to that opening bar for hours trying to figure how on earth someone made such sounds. Like John Bonham's ludicrous, mansion-backed stomp at the start of \"When The Levee Breaks\"-only far less expensive-the crisp, trebly snare sound with which Martin Hannett would make his career announced Unknown Pleasures as a finessed, foreboding masterpiece. Peter Hook's compressed bass rides up front as \"Disorder\" comes together, but it's not until the hugely reverbed, minor note guitar line crashes through that you can understand the need for such a muted, analog treatment to Hook's line. Layering a few tracks together to create a six-string shriek, Hannett's equalization cuts the brunt of Sumner's fuller live sound down to an echoing squeal, revealing a desperation born of longing rather than rage. This is the way, step inside.",

    "description": "Former cop Frank Elder is once more drawn out of retirement by a phone call from his ex-wife, this time asking him to look into the disappearance of her friend Jennie's older, widowed sister Claire in Nottingham. Elder reluctantly agrees to return to the city where his family disintegrated. <br />Elder soon uncovers sexual secrets of Claire's that take Jennie by surprise. But when Claire is found dead at home--unmarked and carefully dressed--it is Elder who is surprised by the similarities to an old case. To solve this riddle, Elder will have to repartner with another person from his past, Detective Inspector Maureen Prior, and delve into several suspects' own traumatic histories. <br />In a case in which neither memories, confessions, nor instincts can be trusted, Elder struggles with the weight of the past and Harvey delivers another psychologically trenchant page-turner.<br />",

    "description": "Acclaimed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin illuminates Abraham Lincoln's political genius in this highly original work, as the one-term congressman and prairie lawyer rises from obscurity to prevail over three gifted rivals of national reputation to become president.<br /><br />On May 18, 1860, William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Abraham Lincoln waited in their hometowns for the results from the Republican National Convention in Chicago. When Lincoln emerged as the victor, his rivals were dismayed and angry.<br /><br />Throughout the turbulent 1850s, each had energetically sought the presidency as the conflict over slavery was leading inexorably to secession and civil war. That Lincoln succeeded, Goodwin demonstrates, was the result of a character that had been forged by experiences that raised him above his more privileged and accomplished rivals. He won because he possessed an extraordinary ability to put himself in the place of other men, to experience what they were feeling, to understand their motives and desires.<br /><br />It was this capacity that enabled Lincoln as president to bring his disgruntled opponents together, create the most unusual cabinet in history, and marshal their talents to the task of preserving the Union and winning the war.<br /><br />We view the long, horrifying struggle from the vantage of the White House as Lincoln copes with incompetent generals, hostile congressmen, and his raucous cabinet. He overcomes these obstacles by winning the respect of his former competitors, and in the case of Seward, finds a loyal and crucial friend to see him through.<br /><br />This brilliant multiple biography is centered on Lincoln's mastery of men and how it shaped the most significant presidency in the nation's history.",

    "description": "In this masterful book, David McCullough tells the intensely human story of those who marched with General George Washington in the year of the Declaration of Independence - when the whole American cause was riding on their success, without which all hope for independence would have been dashed and the noble ideals of the Declaration would have amounted to little more than words on paper.<br /><br />Based on extensive research in both American and British archives, <i>1776</i> is a powerful drama written with extraordinary narrative vitality. It is the story of Americans in the ranks, men of every shape, size, and color, farmers, schoolteachers, shoemakers, no-accounts, and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King's men, the British commander, William Howe, an his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.<br /><br />At the center of the drama, with Washington, are two young American patriots, who, at first, knew no more of war than what they had read in books - Nathaniel Green, a Quaker who was made a general at thirty-three, and Henry Knox, a twenty-five-year-old bookseller who had the preposterous idea of hauling the guns of Fort Ticonderoga overland to Boston in the dead of Winter.<br /><br />But it is the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost - Washington, who had never before led an army in battle. Written as a companion work to his celebrated biography of John Adams, David McCullough's <i>1776</i> is another landmark in the literature of American history.",

    "description": "Informs our understanding of American politics--then and now--and gives us a new perspective on the unpredictable forces that shape history.<br /><br />An illuminating study of the intertwined lives of the founders of the American republic--John Adams, Aaron Burr, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington.<br /><br />During the 1790s, which Ellis calls the most decisive decade in our nation's history, the greatest statesmen of their generation--and perhaps any--came together to define the new republic and direct its course for the coming centuries. Ellis focuses on six discrete moments that exemplify the most crucial issues facing the fragile new nation: Burr and Hamilton's deadly duel, and what may have really happened; Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison's secret dinner, during which the seat of the permanent capital was determined in exchange for passage of Hamilton's financial plan; Franklin's petition to end the \"peculiar institution\" of slavery--his last public act--and Madison's efforts to quash it; Washington's precedent-setting Farewell Address, announcing his retirement from public office and offering his country some final advice; Adams's difficult term as Washington's successor and his alleged scheme to pass the presidency on to his son; and finally, Adams and Jefferson's renewed correspondence at the end of their lives, in which they compared their different views of the Revolution and its legacy.<br /><br />In a lively and engaging narrative, Ellis recounts the sometimes collaborative, sometimes archly antagonistic interactions between these men, and shows us the private characters behind the public personas: Adams, the ever-combative iconoclast, whose closest political collaborator was his wife, Abigail; Burr, crafty, smooth, and one of the most despised public figures of his time; Hamilton, whose audacious manner and deep economic savvy masked his humble origins; Jefferson, renowned for his eloquence, but so reclusive and taciturn that he rarely spoke more than a few sentences in public; Madison, small, sickly, and paralyzingly shy, yet one of the most effective debaters of his generation; and the stiffly formal Washington, the ultimate realist, larger-than-life, and America's only truly indispensable figure.<br /><br />Ellis argues that the checks and balances that permitted the infant American republic to endure were not primarily legal, constitutional, or institutional, but intensely personal, rooted in the dynamic interaction of leaders with quite different visions and values. Revisiting the old-fashioned idea that character matters, Founding Brothers informs our understanding of American politics--then and now--and gives us a new perspective on the unpredictable forces that shape history.",

    "description": "They were America's longest lasting dynasty, the closest thing to a royal family our nation has ever known. The Adamses played a leading role in America's affairs for nearly two centuries -- from John, the self-taught lawyer who rose to the highest office in the government he helped to create; to John Quincy, the child prodigy who followed his father to the White House and fought slavery in Congress; to Charles Francis, the Civil War diplomat; to Henry, the brilliant scholar and journalist. Indeed, the history of the Adams family can be read as the history of America itself. For when the Adamses \"looked at their past, they saw the nation's,\" writes author Richard Brookhiser. \"When they looked at the nation's past, they saw themselves.\" \"America's First Dynasty\" charts the family's travels through American history along with an impressive cast of characters, among them George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Ulysses S. Grant, and Theodore Roosevelt. Brookhiser also details the darker side of the Adams experience, from the specters of alcoholism and suicide to the crushing burden of performance passed on from father to son. Yet by putting a human face on this legendary family, Brookhiser succeeds in creating an impassioned, heroic family portrait that the American public is not likely to forget.",

In preda al panico, ti precipiti in camera dei tuoi genitori. Loro sono stati trasformati in bambini. Racconta il seguito\"? Di norma, non succede niente. Ma nelle mani del prosivendolo Pennac, tutto. Ed ecco tre simpatici mocciosi che si trovano a dover affrontare, anzitempo, l'et\u00e0 adulta, ma anche, e soprattutto, l'infanzia dei genitori. Igor, Joseph e Nourdine, tutti nati rigorosamente a Belleville, vengono bruscamente catapultati nel mondo dei grandi avventurandosi nel proibito \"Viale delle donne\", chiedendo aiuto a un rabbino illuminato e a una prostituta romantica, seguendo la voce di un pap\u00e0 morto troppo presto per una trasfusione di sangue infetto.",

A city of monsters and saints, murderers and angels, knights in armour and pale girls in black velvet. This is the city of the people who have fallen between the cracks.<br /><br />Richard Mayhew, a young businessman, is going to find out more than enough about this other London. A single act of kindness catapults him out of his workday existence and into a world that is at once eerily familiar and utterly bizarre. And a strange destiny awaits him down here, beneath his native city: Neverwhere.",

With no memory of who he is or how he has arrived there, he pores over the relics on the desk, examining the circumstances of his confinement and searching his own hazy mind for clues.</div>\n  <div><br />Determining that he is locked in, the man--identified only as Mr. Blank--begins reading a manuscript he finds on the desk, the story of another prisoner, set in an alternate world the man doesn't recognize. Nevertheless, the pages seem to have been left for him, along with a haunting set of photographs. As the day passes, various characters call on the man in his cell--vaguely familiar people, some who seem to resent him for crimes he can't remember--and each brings frustrating hints of his identity and his past. All the while an overhead camera clicks and clicks, recording his movements, and a microphone records every sound in the room. Someone is watching.</div>\n  <div><br />Both chilling and poignant, <i>Travels in the Scriptorium</i> is vintage Auster: mysterious texts, fluid identities, a hidden past, and, somewhere, an obscure tormentor. And yet, as we discover during one day in the life of Mr. Blank, his world is not so different from our own.</div>\n</div>",

    "description": "Delia Hopkins has led a charmed life. Raised in rural New Hampshire by her widowed father, Andrew, she now has a young daughter, a handsome fiance, and her own search-and-rescue bloodhound, which she uses to find missing persons. But as Delia plans her wedding, she is plagued by flashbacks of a life she can't recall. And then a policeman knocks on her door, revealing a secret that changes the world as she knows it.\" In shock and confusion, Delia must sift through the truth - even when it jeopardizes her life and the lives of those she loves. What happens when you learn you are not who you thought you were? When the people you've loved and trusted suddenly change before your eyes? When getting your deepest wish means giving up what you've always taken for granted? Vanishing Acts explores how life - as we know it - might not turn out the way we imagined; how doing the right thing could mean doing the wrong thing; how the memory we thought had vanished could return as a threat.",

It's four weeks later, and already the honeymoon is over: the man of her dreams votes conservative and folds his clothes at night, making Bridget feel pressured to do so as well. But all of these problems pale in comparison to Rebecca - a beautiful, man-hunting arch-nemesis without a girlfriend code of ethics when it comes to stealing another woman's man. As always, Bridget's best Singleton friends Jude and Shaz are there to give her advice from the pages of GETTING THE LOVE YOU WANT and KEEPING THE LOVE YOU FIND with some unexpected results.",

Now she finds herself stranded at a Wal-Mart in Sequoyah, Oklahoma, with just $7.77 in change. But Novalee is about to discover hidden treasures in this small Southwest town--a group of down-to-earth, deeply caring people willing to help a homeless, jobless girl living secretly in a Wal-Mart. From Bible-thumping blue-haired Sister Thelma Husband to eccentric librarian Forney Hull who loves Novalee more than she loves herself, they are about to take her--and you, too--on a moving, funny, and unforgettable journey to . . .

    "description": "Contains the novels Wild Seed, Mind of My Mind, Clay's Ark, and Patternmaster.<br /><br />In her classic Patternist series, multiple Hugo and Nebula award winner Octavia E. Butler established themes of identity and transformation that echo throughout her distinguished career. Now collected for the first time in one volume, these four novels take readers on a wondrous odyssey from a mythic, prim/ordial past to a fantastic far future.<br />In ancient Africa, a female demigod of nurture and fertility mates with a powerful, destructive male entity. Together they birth a race of madmen, visionaries, and psychics who cling to civilization's margins and back alleys for millenia, coming together in a telepathic Pattern just as Earth is consumed by a cosmic invasion. Now these new beings--no longer mearly human--will battle to rule the transfigured world.",

Forced to discover what she can about her stolen former life, she must at the same time learn who wanted - and still wants - to destroy her and those she cares for and how she can save herself. <i>Fledgling</i> is a captivating novel that tests the limits of \"otherness\" and questions what it means to be truly human.",

Robert Sullivan turns the lowly rat into the star of this most perversely intriguing, remarkable, and unexpectedly elegant <i>New York Times</i> bestseller.</b><br /><br />Love them or loathe them, rats are here to stay-they are city dwellers as much as (or more than) we are, surviving on the effluvia of our society. In <i>Rats</i>, the critically acclaimed bestseller, Robert Sullivan spends a year investigating a rat-infested alley just a few blocks away from Wall Street. Sullivan gets to know not just the beast but its friends and foes: the exterminators, the sanitation workers, the agitators and activists who have played their part in the centuries-old war between human city dweller and wild city rat.<br /><br />Sullivan looks deep into the largely unrecorded history of the city and its masses-its herds-of-rats-like mob. Funny, wise, sometimes disgusting but always compulsively readable, <i>Rats</i> earns its unlikely place alongside the great classics of nature writing.<br /><br />With an all-new Afterword by the author",

Often considered to be the Great American Novel, Moby-Dick is at once a starkly realistic story of whaling, a romance of unusual adventure, and a searing drama of heroic courage, moral conflict, and mad obsession. Widely misunderstood in its own time, Moby Dick has since become an indubitable classic of American literature.",

    "description": "Ethan Allen Hawley, the protagonist of Steinbeck\u2019s last novel, works as a clerk in a grocery store that his family once owned. With Ethan no longer a member of Long Island\u2019s aristocratic class, his wife is restless, and his teenage children are hungry for the tantalizing material comforts he cannot provide. Then one day, in a moment of moral crisis, Ethan decides to take a holiday from his own scrupulous standards.<br /><br />Set in Steinbeck\u2019s contemporary 1960 America, the novel explores the tenuous line between private and public honesty that today ranks it alongside his most acclaimed works of penetrating insight into the American condition. This edition features an introduction and notes by Steinbeck scholar Susan Shillinglaw.",

    "description": "<p>From Dennis Lehane, the award-winning author of <i>Mystic River, Shutter Island,</i> and the Kenzie-Gennaro series, comes a surprisingly different collection of five short stories: </p> <blockquote> <p> \"Running Out of Dog\"<br /> \"ICU\"<br /> \"Gone Down to Corpus\"<br /> \"Mushrooms\"<br /> \"Until Gwen\" </p> </blockquote> <p> At turns suspenseful, surreal, romantic, and tragically comic, these tales journey headlong into the heart of our national myths about class, gender, freedom, and regeneration through violence and reveal that the truth waiting for us there is not what we'd expect. </p>",

U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule, have come to Shutter Island, home of Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane, to investigate the disappearance of a patient. Multiple murderess Rachel Solando is loose somewhere on this remote and barren island, despite having been kept in a locked cell under constant surveillance. As a killer hurricane relentlessly bears down on them, a strange case takes on even darker, more sinister shades\u2014with hints of radical experimentation, horrifying surgeries, and lethal countermoves made in the cause of a covert shadow war. No one is going to escape Shutter Island unscathed, because nothing at Ashecliffe Hospital is what it seems. But then neither is Teddy Daniels.",

One boy got into the car, two did not, and something terrible happened -- something that ended their friendship and changed all three boys forever. <br /><br />Twenty-five years later, Sean is a homicide detective. Jimmy is an ex-con who owns a corner store. And Dave is trying to hold his marriage together and keep his demons at bay -- demons that urge him to do terrible things. When Jimmy's daughter is found murdered, Sean is assigned to the case. His investigation brings him into conflict with Jimmy, who finds his old criminal impulses tempt him to solve the crime with brutal justice. And then there is Dave, who came home the night Jimmy's daughter died covered in someone else's blood. <br /><br />A tense and unnerving psychological thriller, Mystic River is also an epic novel of love and loyalty, faith and family, in which people irrevocably marked by the past find themselves on a collision course with the darkest truths of their own hidden selves.",

Uma hist\u00f3ria feita de muitas hist\u00f3rias. A hist\u00f3rias dos g\u00e9meos Estha e Rahel, nascidos em 1962, por entre not\u00edcias de uma guerra perdida. A de sua m\u00e3e Ammu, que ama de noite o homem que os filhos amam de dia, e de Velutha, o intoc\u00e1vel deus das pequenas coisas. A da av\u00f3 Mammachi, a matriarca cujo corpo guarda cicatrizes da viol\u00eancia de Pappachi. A do tio Chacko, que anseia pela visita da ex-mulher inglesa, Margaret, e da filha de ambos, Sophie Mol. A da sua tia-av\u00f3 mais nova, Baby Kochamma, resignada a adiar para a eternidade o seu amor terreno pelo Padre Mulligan.<br />Estas s\u00e3o as pequenas hist\u00f3rias de uma fam\u00edlia que vive numa \u00e9poca conturbada e de um pa\u00eds cuja ess\u00eancia parece eterna. Onde s\u00f3 as pequenas coisas s\u00e3o ditas e as grandes coisas permanecem por dizer.<br />\"O Deus das Pequenos Coisas\" \u00e9 uma apaixonante saga familiar que, pelos seus rasgos de realismo m\u00e1gico, levou a cr\u00edtica a comparar Arundhati Roy com Salmon Rushdie e Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.",

    "description": "The famous confession of Alexander Portnoy, who is thrust through life by his unappeasable sexuality, yet held back at the same time by the iron grip of his unforgettable childhood. Hilariously funny, boldly intimate, startlingly candid, <i>Portnoy\u2019s Complaint</i> was an immediate bestseller upon its publication in 1969, and is perhaps Roth\u2019s best-known book.<br /><br /><i>Portnoy's Complaint</i> n. [after Alexander Portnoy (1933-)] A disorder in which strongly-felt ethical and altruistic impulses are perpetually warring with extreme sexual longings, often of a perverse nature. Spielvogel says: 'Acts of exhibitionism, voyeurism, fetishism, auto-eroticism and oral coitus are plentiful; as a consequence of the patient's \"morality,\" however, neither fantasy nor act issues in genuine sexual gratification, but rather in overriding feelings of shame and the dread of retribution, particularly in the form of castration.' (Spielvogel, O. 'The Puzzled Penis', <i>Internationale Zeitschrift fur Psychoanalyse, </i>Vol. XXIV, p. 909.) it is believed by Spielvogel that many of the symptoms can be traced to the bonds obtaining in the mother-child relationship.",

    "description": "<i>Moomin Book One </i>is the first volume of Drawn &amp; Quarterly\u2019s publishing plan to reprint the entire strip drawn by Jansson before she handed over the reins to her brother Lars in 1960. This is the first time the strip will be published in any form in North America and will deservedly place Jansson among the international cartooning greats of the last century.<br />\u00a0The Moomins are a tight-knit family\u2013hippo-shaped creatures with easygoing and adventurous outlooks. Jansson\u2019s art is pared down and precise, yet able to compose beautiful portraits of ambling creatures in fields of flowers or on rock-strewn beaches that recall Jansson\u2019s Nordic roots. The comic strip reached out to adults with its gentle and droll sense of humor. Whimsical but with biting undertones, Jansson\u2019s observations of everyday life, including guests who overstay their welcome, modern art, movie stars, and high society, easily caught the attention of an international audience and still resonate today.",

Based on historical events that took place on the Texas-Mexico border in the 1850s, it traces the fortunes of the Kid, a fourteen-year-old Tennesseean who stumbles into a nightmarish world where Indians are being murdered and the market for their scalps is thriving.",

Although the island has a number of inhabitants, Mario has only one postal customer, the only literate resident, who is also Chile's most beloved poet, Pablo Neruda, who is living in exile.<br />The friendship between the postman and the poet blossoms, Mario begs Neruda for advice on how best to woo the voluptuous young barmaid, Beatriz, with whom Mario has fallen in love. As Neruda tutors him in the finer lessons of love, Mario discovers that he too has a gift for poetry. Soon the island air is thick with the exchange of sensuous metaphors.",

At first, he believes he hates Sarah and her husband, Henry. Yet as he delves deeper into his emotional outlook, Bendrix's hatred shifts to the God he feels has broken his life, but whose existence at last comes to recognize.",

    "description": "It is hard to believe it now, but in 1863, the French painter, Ernest Meissonier was one of the most famous artists in the world. The darling of the 'Salon' - that all-important public exhibition of Art held biannually in Paris - he painted historical subjects in meticulous detail and sold his works for astronomical sums to collectors, who included Napoleon III himself. Manet, on the other hand, was struggling in obscurity. Famous today as the 'Father of Impressionism', when this book opens he was known only as the sloppy painter of a few much-derided canvases, depicting bourgeois gentlemen in top hats and Absinthe-drinking beggars. With his usual narrative brilliance, and eye for telling detail, Ross King has taken the parallel careers of Meissonier and Manet and used them as a lens for their times. Beginning with the year that Manet exhibited his ground-breaking 'Dejeuner sur l'herbe' and ending in 1874, with the first 'Impressionist' exhibition, King plunges us into Parisian life - on the streets and in the corridors of power - during a ten-year period full of social and political ferment. These were the years in which Napoleon III's censorious and pleasure-seeking Second Empire fell from its heights into the ignominy of the Franco-Prussian war and the ensuing Paris Commune of 1871. But also, when a group of artists, with Manet at the vanguard, began to challenge the establishment by refusing to paint classical or historical subjects and, instead, turning to the landscapes and ordinary people they saw around them. Benign as such paintings might seem today, they helped change the course of history. The struggle between Meissonier and Manet to get their paintings exhibited in pride of place at the Salon was not just about Art, it was about how to see the world.",

    "description": "In this much needed resource, Maryellen Weimer-one of the nation's most highly regarded authorities on effective college teaching-offers a comprehensive work on the topic of learner-centered teaching in the college and university classroom. As the author explains, learner-centered teaching focuses attention on what the student is learning, how the student is learning, the conditions under which the student is learning, whether the student is retaining and applying the learning, and how current learning positions the student for future learning. To help educators accomplish the goals of learner-centered teaching, this important book presents the meaning, practice, and ramifications of the learner-centered approach, and how this approach transforms the college classroom environment. Learner-Centered Teaching shows how to tie teaching and curriculum to the process and objectives of learning rather than to the content delivery alone.",

Name that Demon!!! Freaky boyfriends! Shouting Moms! Innocence betrayed! These are some of the pickled demons you'll meet as Lynda Barry mixes the true and the un-true into something she calls \"autobificitionalography.\" From her nattering and intolerant/loving Filipina grandmother to the ex-boyfriend from hell who had lice,\u00a0Lynda Barry's demons jump out of these pages and double-dare you to speak their names. Called by Time magazine \"a work of art as well as literature,\" <i>One Hundred Demons </i>has been hailed for its shimmering watercolor images and unforgettable stories about life's little monsters.",

    "description": "Louis-Ferdinand Celine's revulsion and anger at what he considered the idiocy and hypocrisy of society explodes from nearly every page of this novel. Filled with slang and obscenities and written in raw, colloquial language, <em>Journey to the End of the Night</em> is a literary symphony of violence, cruelty and obscene nihilism. This book shocked most critics when it was first published in France in 1932, but quickly became a success with the reading public in Europe, and later in America where it was first published by New Directions in 1952. The story of the improbable yet convincingly described travels of the petit-bourgeois (and largely autobiographical) antihero, Bardamu, from the trenches of World War I, to the African jungle, to New York and Detroit, and finally to life as a failed doctor in Paris, takes the readers by the scruff and hurtles them toward the novel's inevitable, sad conclusion.",

    "description": "In the tradition of grand sweeping histories such as <em>From Dawn To Decadence</em>, <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>, and <em>A History of God</em>, Hecht champions doubt and questioning as one of the great and noble, if unheralded, intellectual traditions that distinguish the Western mind especially-from Socrates to Galileo and Darwin to Wittgenstein and Hawking. This is an account of the world's greatest \u2018intellectual virtuosos,' who are also humanity's greatest doubters and disbelievers, from the ancient Greek philosophers, Jesus, and the Eastern religions, to modern secular equivalents Marx, Freud and Darwin\u2014and their attempts to reconcile the seeming meaninglessness of the universe with the human need for meaning,<br /><br />This remarkable book ranges from the early Greeks, Hebrew figures such as Job and Ecclesiastes, Eastern critical wisdom, Roman stoicism, Jesus as a man of doubt, Gnosticism and Christian mystics, medieval Islamic, Jewish and Christian skeptics, secularism, the rise of science, modern and contemporary critical thinkers such as Schopenhauer, Darwin, Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, the existentialists.",

    "description": "Tristan Tzara\u2014poet, literary iconoclast, and catalyst\u2014was the founder of the Dada movement that began in Z\u00fcrich during World War I. His ideas were inspired by his contempt for the bourgeois values and traditional attitudes towards art that existed at the time. This volume contains the famous manifestos that first appeared between 1916 and 1921 that would become the basic texts upon which Dada was based. For Tzara, art was both deadly serious and a game. The playfulness of Dada is evident in the manifestos, both in Tzara's polemic\u2014which often uses dadaist typography\u2014as well as in the delightful doodles and drawings contributed by Francis Picabia. Also included are Tzara's <i>Lampisteries</i>, a series of articles that throw light on the various art forms contemporary to his own work. Post-war art had grown weary of the old certainties and the carnage they caused. Tzara was on the cutting edge at a time when art was becoming more subjective and abstract, and beginning to reject the reality of the mind for that of the senses.",

    "description": "Singular, capital, wonderfully enjoyable, this is the biggest collection of new Sherlock Holmes stories published since Sir Arthur Conan Doyle laid down his pen - nearly 200,000 words of superb fiction featuring the Great Detective by masters of historical crime. Almost all the stories are specially written for the collection and the cases are presented in the order in which Holmes solved them. <br /><br />The result is a life of Sherlock Holmes, with a continuous narrative alongside the stories which identities the gaps in the canon and places the new and hitherto unrecorded cases in their correct sequence - plus there is an invaluable, complete Holmes chronology.<br />(back cover)",

    "description": "Amid the disapproving gossip of the Court, a royal romance defies all obstacles.<br /><br />The Court of Fran\u00e7ois I is full of lust, intrigue, and bawdy bon temps\u2014a different world from the quiet country life Diane de Poitiers led with her elderly husband. Now a widow, the elegant Diane is called back to Court, where the King\u2019s obvious interest marks her as an enemy to the King\u2019s favourite, Anne d\u2019Heilly. The Court is soon electrified by rumors of their confrontations. As Anne calls on her most venomous tricks to drive Diane away, Diane finds an ally in the one member of Court with no allegiance to the King\u2019s mistress: his teenage second son, Henri.<br /><br />Neglected by his father and disliked by his brothers, Prince Henri expects little from his life. But as his friendship with Diane deepens into infatuation and then a romance that scandalizes the Court, the Prince begins to discover hope for a future with Diane. But fate and his father have other plans for Henri\u2014including a political marriage with Catherine de Medici. Despite daunting obstacles, Henri\u2019s devotion to Diane never wanes; their passion becomes one of the most legendary romances in the history of France.",

Confined to bedrest during a difficult pregnancy, she happily awaits the return of her husband and little girl from a ballet recital, only to find that her worst fears have finally been realized. All seems lost until a phone call to her grandmother in America unexpectedly revives a decades-old oath, creating a force that transends time and place, to rescue her loved ones. Over the course of five terror- and hope-filled days, the ties that bind two generations forge a potent alliance against contemporary evil.",

One woman stands between those determined to control history and those who will risk their lives for freedom.<br /><br />A world that exists in the shadows of our own.<br /><br />A conflict we will never see.<br /><br />One woman stands between those determined to control history and those who will risk their lives for freedom.<br /><br />Maya is hiding in plain sight in London. The twenty-six-year-old has abandoned the dangerous obligations pressed upon her by her father, and chosen instead to live a normal life. But Maya comes from a long line of people who call themselves Harlequins\u2014a fierce group of warriors willing to sacrifice their lives to protect a select few known as Travelers.<br /><br />Gabriel and Michael Corrigan are brothers living in Los Angeles. Since childhood, the young men have been shaped by stories that their late father was a Traveler, one of a small band of prophets who have vastly influenced the course of history. Travelers are able to attain pure enlightenment, and have for centuries ushered change into the world. Gabriel and Michael, who may have inherited their father's gifts, have always protected themselves by living \u201coff the Grid\u201d\u2014that is, invisible to the real-life surveillance networks that monitor people in our modern society.<br /><br />Summoned by her ailing father, Maya is told of the existence of the brothers. The Corrigans are in severe danger, stalked by powerful men known as the Tabula\u2014ruthless mercenaries who have hunted Travelers for generations. This group is determined to inflict order on the world by controlling it, and they view Travelers as an intolerable threat. As Maya races to California to protect the brothers, she is reluctantly pulled back into the cold and solitary Harlequin existence. A colossal battle looms\u2014one that will reveal not only the identities of Gabriel and Michael Corrigan but also a secret history of our time.<br /><br />Moving from the back alleys of Prague to the heart of Los Angeles, from the high deserts of Arizona to a guarded research facility in New York, The Traveler explores a parallel world that exists alongside our own. John Twelve Hawks' stunningly suspenseful debut is an international publishing sensation that marks the arrival of a major new talent.",

But when she heads west with high hopes and a barely functional car, she meets the human condition head-on. By the time Taylor arrives in Tucson, Arizona, she has acquired a completely unexpected child, a three-year-old American Indian girl named Turtle, and must somehow come to terms with both motherhood and the necessity for putting down roots. Hers is a story about love and friendship, abandonment and belonging, and the discovery of surprising resources in apparently empty places.",

But amidst the crowds of London's Crystal Palace, Passion finds herself discreetly, yet insistently, pursued by a sensual gentleman who awakens her long-supressed desires. After a loveless marriage of restrained propriety, Passion abandons herself to true bliss for the first time.<br /><br />Intoxicated by his encounter with the beautiful stranger, Mark Randolph Hawkmore, Earl of Langley, cannot wait to see her again. As a series of rapturous rendezvous follows, he and his mystery lover find something rare and wonderful blossoming between them. But a blackmail scheme against the Earl threatens to destroy everything. As a scandal brews, each will have to choose between duty and desire...their love for their families\u2014and their love for each other.",

She has never forgotten the values of her Irish granny--the everyday happiness of family, good friends, and hard work. Bay and her husband, Sean, have weathered rough spells and moved on. Now a perfect summer, filled with the scent of beach roses, lies before them. <br /><br />Charming and ambitious, Sean splits his energy between the town bank, his old fishing boat, and the family he seems to adore--until he leaves his young daughter stranded after school. As troubling memories resurface, a phone call confirms that Sean is missing. So begins a season that will change everything. As the door to all Bay cherishes seems to close forever, another opens, and an old love steps through. Embraced by enduring friendships, Bay will discover the truth of who she is--what love is--and how life's deepest mysteries are often those closest to home.",

He tells a lurid tale of greed, manipulation, power and prejudice that has made Los Angeles one of the most cosmopolitan and most class-divided cities in the United States.<br /><br />Davis' elegiac tale points to a future in which the sublime and the dreadful are inextricable. That future does not belong to Southern California alone. Terrifyingly it belongs to us all.<br /><br /><i>City of Quartz </i>won the 1990 American Social Science Association Best Book Award.",

    "description": "If humankind can be said to have a single greatest creation, it would be those places that represent the most eloquent expression of our species's ingenuity, beliefs, and ideals: the city. In this authoritative and engagingly written account, the acclaimed urbanist and bestselling author examines the evolution of urban life over the millennia and, in doing so, attempts to answer the age-old question: What makes a city great?<br /><br />Despite their infinite variety, all cities essentially serve three purposes: spiritual, political, and economic. Kotkin follows the progression of the city from the early religious centers of Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and China to the imperial centers of the Classical era, through the rise of the Islamic city and the European commercial capitals, ending with today's post-industrial suburban metropolis.<br /><br />Despite widespread optimistic claims that cities are \"back in style,\" Kotkin warns that whatever their form, cities can thrive only if they remain sacred, safe, and busy-and this is true for both the increasingly urbanized developing world and the often self-possessed \"global cities\" of the West and East Asia.<br /><br />Looking at cities in the twenty-first century, Kotkin discusses the effects of developments such as shifting demographics and emerging technologies. He also considers the effects of terrorism-how the religious and cultural struggles of the present pose the greatest challenge to the urban future.<br /><br />Truly global in scope, <b>The City</b> is a timely narrative that will place Kotkin in the company of Lewis Mumford, Jane Jacobs, and other preeminent urban scholars.",

    "description": "'Without question, Margaret MacMillan's Paris 1919 is the most honest and engaging history ever written about those fateful months after World War I when the maps of Europe were redrawn. Brimming with lucid analysis, elegant character sketches, and geopolitical pathos, it is essential reading.'<br /><br />Between January and July 1919, after \"the war to end all wars,\" men and women from around the world converged on Paris to shape the peace. Center stage, for the first time in history, was an American president, Woodrow Wilson, who with his Fourteen Points seemed to promise to so many people the fulfillment of their dreams. Stern, intransigent, impatient when it came to security concerns and wildly idealistic in his dream of a League of Nations that would resolve all future conflict peacefully, Wilson is only one of the larger-than-life characters who fill the pages of this extraordinary book. David Lloyd George, the gregarious and wily British prime minister, brought Winston Churchill and John Maynard Keynes. Lawrence of Arabia joined the Arab delegation. Ho Chi Minh, a kitchen assistant at the Ritz, submitted a petition for an independent Vietnam.<br /><br />For six months, Paris was effectively the center of the world as the peacemakers carved up bankrupt empires and created new countries. This book brings to life the personalities, ideals, and prejudices of the men who shaped the settlement. They pushed Russia to the sidelines, alienated China, and dismissed the Arabs. They struggled with the problems of Kosovo, of the Kurds, and of a homeland for the Jews.<br /><br />The peacemakers, so it has been said, failed dismally; above all they failed to prevent another war. Margaret MacMillan argues that they have unfairly been made the scapegoats for the mistakes of those who came later. She refutes received ideas about the path from Versailles to World War II and debunks the widely accepted notion that reparations imposed on the Germans were in large part responsible for the Second World War.<br /><br />A landmark work of narrative history, Paris 1919 is the first full-scale treatment of the Peace Conference in more than twenty-five years. It offers a scintillating view of those dramatic and fateful days when much of the modern world was sketched out, when countries were created--Iraq, Yugoslavia, Israel--whose troubles haunt us still.<br /><br />Winner of the Samuel Johnson Prize, the PEN Hessell Tiltman Prize and the Duff Cooper Prize",

    "description": "Christopher Marlowe (1564-1593), a man of extreme passions and a playwright of immense talent, is the most important of Shakespeare's contemporaries. This edition offers his five major plays, which show the radicalism and vitality of his writing in the few years before his violent death.<br /> Tamburlaine Part One and Part Two deal with the rise to world prominence of the great Scythian shepherd-robber; The Jew of Malta is a drama of villainy and revenge; Edward II was to influence Shakespeare's Richard II. Doctor Faustus, perhaps the first drama taken from the medieval legend of a man who sells his soul to the devil, is here in both its A- and its B- text, showing the enormous and fascinating differences between the two.<br /> Under the General Editorship of Dr. Michael Cordner of the University of York, the texts of the plays have been newly edited and are presented with modernized spelling and punctuation. In addition, there is a scholarly introduction and detailed annotation.",

    "description": "\u2022 Why are lovers quicker to forgive their partners for infidelity than for leaving dirty dishes in the sink? \u2022 Why will sighted people pay more to avoid going blind than blind people will pay to regain their sight? \u2022 Why do dining companions insist on ordering different meals instead of getting what they really want? \u2022 Why do pigeons seem to have such excellent aim; why can\u2019t we remember one song while listening to another; and why does the line at the grocery store always slow down the moment we join it? In this brilliant, witty, and accessible book, renowned Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert describes the foibles of imagination and illusions of foresight that cause each of us to misconceive our tomorrows and misestimate our satisfactions. Vividly bringing to life the latest scientific research in psychology, cognitive neuroscience, philosophy, and behavioral economics, Gilbert reveals what scientists have discovered about the uniquely human ability to imagine the future, and about our capacity to predict how much we will like it when we get there. With penetrating insight and sparkling prose, Gilbert explains why we seem to know so little about the hearts and minds of the people we are about to become.",

    "description": "Published in 1936, Absalom, Absalom! is considered by many to be William Faulkner's masterpiece. Although the novel's complex and fragmented structure poses considerable difficulty to readers, the book's literary merits place it squarely in the ranks of America's finest novels. The story concerns Thomas Sutpen, a poor man who finds wealth and then marries into a respectable family. His ambition and extreme need for control bring about his ruin and the ruin of his family. Sutpen's story is told by several narrators, allowing the reader to observe variations in the saga as it is recounted by different speakers. This unusual technique spotlights one of the novel's central questions: To what extent can people know the truth about the past?<br /><br />(from bookrags.com)",

With a teenager's eye for freakish detail and a nervous ability to make the most horrible scenes seem hilarious, <i>Cruddy</i> is a stunning achievement.",

Burroughs</b> comes thirteen unnerving and often breathtaking stories populated by punks and angels, skinheads and religious assassins, streetwalkers and fetishists--people who live outside the law and and the clear light of the every day. Set in landscapes as diverse as ancient Babylon, India, and the seamy underbelly of San Francisco, these daring and innovative tales are laced with Vollman's fertile imagination. <b>The Rainbow Stories</b> ushers us into a world that bears an awful yet hypnotic resemblance to that of our deepest nightmares, confirming Vollmann's reputation as a dark visionary of contemporary fiction.",

    "description": "In this quintessential adventure story, Jack London takes readers on an arduous journey through the forbidding Alaskan landscape during the gold rush of the 1890s. Buck, a rangy mixed breed used to a comfortable, sun-filled life as a family dog, is stolen by a greedy opportunist and sold to dog traffickers. In no time, Buck finds himself on a team of sled dogs run ragged in the harsh winter of the Klondike. In a climate where every day is a savage struggle for survival, the last traces of Buck's soft, pampered existence are erased as his dormant primordial urges -- deeply embedded for generations -- are brutally awakened. <br /> The superb detail, taken from London's firsthand knowledge of Alaskan frontier life, makes this classic tale as gripping today as it was almost a hundred years ago. No other novel has so clearly shown the fragile separation between tame and wild, between man and beast. Now, paired with master illustrator Wendell Minor's exquisite paintings, this timeless story is available in a handsome new addition to the Scribner Illustrated Classics collection.",
