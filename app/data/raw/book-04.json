In the years since she arrived at Green Gables as a freckle-faced orphan, she has earned the love of the people of Avonlea <i>and</i> a reputation for getting into scrapes. But when Anne begins her job as the new schoolteacher, the real test of her character begins. Along with teaching the three Rs, she is learning how complicated life can be when she meddles in someone else's romance, finds two new orphans at Green Gables, and wonders about the strange behaviour of the very handsome Gilbert Blythe. As Anne enters womanhood, her adventures touch the heart and the funny bone.",

    "description": "<i>In the near future, disease will be a condition of the past. Most genetic defects will be removed at birth; the remaining during infancy. Unfortunately, there will be a generation left behind. For members of that missed generation, small advances will be made. Through various programs, they will be taught to get along in the world despite their differences. They will be made active and contributing members of society. But they will never be normal.<br /></i><br />Lou Arrendale is a member of that lost generation, born at the wrong time to reap the awards of medical science. Part of a small group of high-functioning autistic adults, he has a steady job with a pharmaceutical company, a car, friends, and a passion for fencing. Aside from his annual visits to his counselor, he lives a low-key, independent life. He has learned to shake hands and make eye contact. He has taught himself to use \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d and other conventions of conversation because he knows it makes others comfortable. He does his best to be as normal as possible and not to draw attention to himself. <br /><br />But then his quiet life comes under attack. It starts with an experimental treatment that will reverse the effects of autism in adults. With this treatment Lou would think and act and <i>be</i> just like everyone else. But if he was suddenly free of autism, would he still be himself? Would he still love the same classical music\u2013with its complications and resolutions? Would he still see the same colors and patterns in the world\u2013shades and hues that others cannot see? Most importantly, would he still love Marjory, a woman who may never be able to reciprocate his feelings? Would it be easier for her to return the love of a \u201cnormal\u201d?<br /><br />There are intense pressures coming from the world around him\u2013including an angry supervisor who wants to cut costs by sacrificing the supports necessary to employ autistic workers. Perhaps even more disturbing are the barrage of questions within himself. For Lou must decide if he should submit to a surgery that might completely change the way he views the world . . . and the very essence of who he is.<br /><br />Thoughtful, provocative, poignant, unforgettable, <i>The Speed of Dark</i> is a gripping exploration into the mind of an autistic person as he struggles with profound questions of humanity and matters of the heart.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "In this literary tour de force, novelist Arthur Golden enters a remote and shimmeringly exotic world. For the protagonist of this peerlessly observant first novel is Sayuri, one of Japan's most celebrated geisha, a woman who is both performer and courtesan, slave and goddess.<br /><br />We follow Sayuri from her childhood in an impoverished fishing village, where in 1929, she is sold to a representative of a geisha house, who is drawn by the child's unusual blue-grey eyes. From there she is taken to Gion, the pleasure district of Kyoto. She is nine years old. In the years that follow, as she works to pay back the price of her purchase, Sayuri will be schooled in music and dance, learn to apply the geisha's elaborate makeup, wear elaborate kimono, and care for a coiffure so fragile that it requires a special pillow. She will also acquire a magnanimous tutor and a venomous rival. Surviving the intrigues of her trade and the upheavals of war, the resourceful Sayuri is a romantic heroine on the order of Jane Eyre and Scarlett O'Hara. And <i>Memoirs of a Geisha</i> is a triumphant work - suspenseful, and utterly persuasive.",

    "description": "A new edition of one of the best-selling and best-loved books of recent years, with a new introduction by the author. The publication of Wild Swans in 1991 was a worldwide phenomenon. Not only did it become the best-selling non-fiction book in British publishing history, with sales of well over two million, it was received with unanimous critical acclaim, and was named the winner of the 1992 NCR Book Award and the 1993 British Book of the Year Award. Few books have ever had such an impact on their readers. Through the story of three generations of women -- grandmother, mother and daughter -- Wild Swans tells nothing less than the whole tumultuous history of China's tragic twentieth century, from sword-bearing warlords to Chairman Mao, from the Manchu Empire to the Cultural Revolution. At times terrifying, at times astonishing, always deeply moving, Wild Swans is a book in a million, a true story with all the passion and grandeur of a great novel. For this new edition, Jung Chang has written a new introduction, bringing her own story up to date, and describing the effect Wild Swans' success has had on her life.",

    "description": "CHICAGO, 1893.<br />ONE MAN BUILT A HEAVEN ON EARTH.<br />ANOTHER BUILT HELL BESIDE IT.<br /><br />The Chicago World's Fair of 1893 was one of the greats wonders of the world. This is the extraordinary story of its realization, and of two men whose fates it linked: one was an architect, the other a serial killer...<br /><br />The architect was Daniel H. Burnham. He created the 'White City', a massive, visionary landscape of white buildings set in an incandescent wonderland of canals and gardens. The killer was H. H. Holmes, a handsome doctor with intense blue eyes, who used the attraction of the great fair - and his own devilish charms - to lure scores, perhaps hundreds, of young women to their deaths. And while Burnham overcame politics, infighting, personality clashes and Chicago's infamous weather to transform the swamps of Jackson Park into the greatest show on Earth, Holmes built his own edifice. He called it the World's Fair Hotel. In reality it was a torture palace, a gas chamber, a crematorium.<br /><br />These two disparate yet driven men together with a remarkable supporting cast, including Buffalo Bill, George Ferris and Thomas Edison, are brought to life in this mesmerizing, murderous tale of the spectacle that transformed America and set it on course for the 20th century.",

    "description": "<b><i>Can't Stop Won't Stop</i> is a powerful cultural and social history of the end of the American century, and a provocative look into the new world that the hip-hop generation created.</b><br /><br />Forged in the fires of the Bronx and Kingston, Jamaica, hip-hop became the Esperanto of youth rebellion and a generation-defining movement. In a post-civil rights era defined by deindustrialization and globalization, hip-hop crystallized a multiracial, polycultural generation's worldview, and transformed American politics and culture. But that epic story has never been told with this kind of breadth, insight, and style.<br /><br />Based on original interviews with DJs, b-boys, rappers, graffiti writers, activists, and gang members, with unforgettable portraits of many of hip-hop's forebears, founders, and mavericks, including DJ Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, Chuck D, and Ice Cube, <i>Can't Stop Won't Stop</i> chronicles the events, the ideas, the music, and the art that marked the hip-hop generation's rise from the ashes of the 60's into the new millennium.",

Although it was not published for over thirty years, it was an instant bestseller when it finally appeared in 1994. The 'first man' is Jacques Cormery, whose poverty-stricken childhood in Algiers is made bearable by his love for his silent and illiterate mother, and by the teacher who transforms his view of the world. The most autobiographical of Camus's novels, it gives profound insights into his life, and the powerful themes underlying his work.",

    "description": "Danny Williams didn't mean to be a lawyer, but somehow he is -- and for up to eighteen hours a day. He's well paid, home owning, and twenty-seven but is also overworked, lonely, and frequently stoned. The plan was to leave the troubles of a small town in Northern Ireland for the big city in England, but one evening an old school friend, Geordie, bursts into Danny's shiny new life. On the run from a Loyalist militia, Geordie brings everything Danny thought he had left behind and dumps it on his doorstep.<br /><br />With infectious wit and energy to burn, <em>Utterly Monkey</em> is a searing, fiercely funny, and ultimately redemptive novel about surviving an office job, outwitting the bad guys, and, hopefully, getting the girl.",

    "description": "Rarely have world writers of such variety and distinction appeared together in the same anthology. Their stories capture the range of emotions and situations of our human universe: tragedy, comedy, fantasy, satire, dramas of sexual love and of war in different continents and cultures. They are not about HIV / AIDS. But all twenty-one writers have given their stories--chosen by themselves as representing some of the best of their lifetime work as storytellers--without any fee or royalty.<br /><br /><i>Telling Tales</i> is being published in more than twelve countries. The publisher's profits from the sales of this book will go to HIV / AIDS preventive education and for medical treatment for people living with the suffering this pandemic infection brings to our contemporary world.<br /><br /><br /><i>Contents</i><br /><br />Acknowledgements<br />Introduction<br /><br />Bulldog (Arthur Miller)<br />The Centaur (Jos\u00e9 Saramago)<br />Down the Quiet Street (Es\u00b4kia Mphahlele)<br />The Firebird\u00b4s Nest (Salman Rushdie)<br />Cell Phone (Ingo Schulze)<br />Death Constant Beyond Love (Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez)<br />The Age of Lead (Margaret Atwood)<br />Witnesses of an Era (G\u00fcnter Grass)<br />The Journey to the Dead (John Updike)<br />Sugar Baby (Chinua Achebe)<br />The Way of the Wind (Amos Oz)<br />Warm Dogs (Paul Theroux)<br />The Ass and the Ox (Michel Tournier)<br />Death of a Son (Njabulo S.

    "description": "Margaret Atwood takes the art of storytelling to new heights in a dazzling novel that unfolds layer by astonishing layer and concludes in a brilliant and wonderfully satisfying twist. Told in a style that magnificently captures the colloquialisms and clich\u00e9s of the 1930s and 1940s, <i>The Blind Assassin</i> is a richly layered and uniquely rewarding experience.<br /><br />It opens with these simple, resonant words: \"Ten days after the war ended, my sister drove a car off the bridge.\" They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister Laura's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a-novel. Entitled <i>The Blind Assassin</i>, it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist.<br /><br />For the past twenty-five years, Margaret Atwood has written works of striking originality and imagination. In <i>The Blind Assassin</i>, she stretches the limits of her accomplishments as never before, creating a novel that is entertaining and profoundly serious. <i>The Blind Assassin</i> proves once again that Atwood is one of the most talented, daring, and exciting writers of our time. Like <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>, it is destined to become a classic.",

    "description": "As helicopters search Northern England's Peak District for fifteen year-old Laura Vernon, Detective Constable Ben Cooper quietly dreads the worst. And when her body is found in the woods, Cooper's investigation begins with a short list of markedly uncooperative suspects: retired miner Harry Dickinson, whose black Labrador discovered Laura's body, and Laura's wealthy parents. Uneasily teamed with ambitious newcomer Detective Constable Diane Fry, Cooper tests a town's family ties, friendships, and loyaties -- and finds that in order to understand the present, they must unearth the past.",

    "description": "The murder of brutal landowner Fyodor Karamazov changes the lives of his sons irrevocably: Mitya, the sensualist, whose bitter rivalry with his father immediately places him under suspicion for parricide; Ivan the intellectual, whose mental tortures drive him to breakdown; the spiritual Alyosha, who tries to heal the family's rifts; and the shadowy figure of their bastard half-brother, Smerdyakov. As the ensuing investigation and trial reveal the true identity of the murder, Dostoyevsky's dark masterwork evokes a world where the lines between innocence and corruption, good and evil, blur, and everyone's faith in humanity is tested.<br /><br />This powerful translation of The Brothers Karamazov features an introduction highlighting Dostoyevsky's recurrent themes of guilt and salvation, with a new chronology and further reading.<br /><br />(back cover)",

Darue Engineering &amp; Manufacturing and Exxon-Mobil Corporation v. Allapattah Services, Inc.<br />- a new chapter on Federal Rule 15 (Amendments to Pleadings), including amendments as of right, the relation back of amendments, and the confusing provision for amendments adding claims against new parties<br />- citations reflecting the most current law throughout the book, which has been entirely updated",

    "description": "A brilliant investigation of globalization, the most significant socioeconomic trend in the world today, and how it is affecting everything we do-economically, politically, and culturally-abroad and at home.<br /><br />As foreign affairs columnist for<i> The New York Times</i>, Thomas L. Friedman crisscrosses the globe talking with the world's economic and political leaders, and reporting, as only he can, on what he sees. Now he has used his years of experience as a reporter and columnist to produce a pithy, trenchant, riveting look at the worldwide market forces that are driving today's economies and how they are playing out both internationally and locally.<br /><br />Globalization is the technologically driven expression of free-market capitalism, and as such is essentially an American creation. It has irrevocably changed the way business is done and has raised living standards throughout the world. But powerful local forces-of religion, race, ethnicity, and cultural identity-are in competition with technology for the hearts and minds of their societies. Finding the proper balance between the Lexus and the olive tree is the great game of globalization-and the ultimate theme of Friedman's challenging, provocative book, essential reading for all who care about how the world really works.<br />",

It reveals the purpose of the moon, explains the difference between criminals and outlaws, examines the conflict between social activism and romantic individualism, and paints a portrait of contemporary society that includes powerful Arabs, exiled royalty, and pregnant cheerleaders. It also deals with the problem of redheads.",

    "description": "Naguib Mahfouz's haunting novella of post-revolutionary Egypt combines a vivid pychological portrait of an anguished man with the suspense and rapid pace of a detective story.<br /><br />After four years in prison, the skilled young thief Said Mahran emerges bent on revenge. He finds a world that has changed in more ways than one. Egypt has undergone a revolution and, on a more personal level, his beloved wife and his trusted henchman, who conspired to betray him to the police, are now married to each other and are keeping his six-year-old daughter from him. But in the most bitter betrayal, his mentor, Rauf Ilwan, once a firebrand revolutionary who convinced Said that stealing from the rich in a unjust society is an act of justice, is now himself a rich man, a respected newspaper editor who wants nothing to do with the disgraced Said. As Said's wild attempts to achieve his idea of justice badly misfire, he becomes a hunted man so driven by hatred that he can only recognize too late his last chance at redemption.",

    "description": "At last in paperback in one complete volume, here are the five novels from Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker series. <br /><br />\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\"<br /><br />Seconds before the Earth is demolished for a galactic freeway, Arthur Dent is saved by Ford Prefect, a researcher for the revised Guide. Together they stick out their thumbs to the stars and begin a wild journey through time and space.<br /><br />\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\"<br /><br />Facing annihilation at the hands of warmongers is a curious time to crave tea. It could only happen to the cosmically displaced Arthur Dent and his comrades as they hurtle across the galaxy in a desperate search for a place to eat.<br /><br />\"Life, the Universe and Everything\"<br /><br />The unhappy inhabitants of planet Krikkit are sick of looking at the night sky- so they plan to destroy it. The universe, that is. Now only five individuals can avert Armageddon: mild-mannered Arthur Dent and his stalwart crew.<br /><br />\"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\"<br /><br />Back on Earth, Arthur Dent is ready to believe that the past eight years were all just a figment of his stressed-out imagination. But a gift-wrapped fishbowl with a cryptic inscription conspires to thrust him back to reality. So to speak.<br /><br />\"Mostly Harmless\"<br /><br />Just when Arthur Dent makes the terrible mistake of starting to enjoy life, all hell breaks loose. Can he save the Earth from total obliteration? Can he save the Guide from a hostile alien takeover? Can he save his daughter from herself?<br /><br />Also includes the short story \"Young Zaphod Plays It Safe\".",

    "description": "At the turn of the century, the Storyville district of New Orleans had some 2,000 prostitutes, 70 professional gamblers, and 30 piano players. It had only one man who played the cornet like Buddy Bolden. By day he cut hair and purveyed gossip at N. Joseph's Shaving Parlor. At night he played jazz as though unleashing wild animals in a crowded room. At the age of thirty-one, Buddy Bolden went mad. From these sparse facts Michael Ondaatje has created a haunting, lushly atmospheric novel about one of jazz's legendary pioneers and martyrs. Obsessed with death, addicted to whiskey, and self-destructively in love with two women, Buddy Bolden embodies all the dire claims that music places on its acolytes.

    "description": "In addition to countless millions of conventional film cameras, digital cameras will be found in one out of every two American households this year. This authoritative guide provides a handy, all-in-one reference for photographers using either medium (or both), combining the practical know-how of more than 50 outstanding professional photographers with National Geographic's world-renowned tradition of excellence and expertise. <br /><br /><i>The Ultimate Field Guide to Photography</i> presents ten easy-to-read chapters exploring every aspect of the digital revolution. With straightforward explanations of both simple, all-but-foolproof equipment like inexpensive autofocus point-and-shoot cameras and of sophisticated, megapixel single lens reflex units boasting interchangeable lenses. It also covers important accessories; provides advice of all kinds, from key facts and basic tips for beginners to advanced techniques for skilled amateurs; and addresses the essentials of PhotoShop editing, scanning and printing, effective archiving, and more. Along with digital information, there's also plenty of material on traditional film, from old techniques to helpful sidebars on when to use film rather than digital. <br /><br />Throughout the book dozens of well-known, highly accomplished photographers showcase some of their most famous shots and share both the human stories behind them and the specific technical details of their creation. This wonderful mix of vivid examples and vital nuts-and-bolts information makes <i>The Ultimate Field Guide to Photography</i> a uniquely useful, indispensable reference for photographers everywhere.",

    "description": "Welcome to the most twisted high-school reunion imaginable, from a rising star of American satire. 'It's confession time, fellow alumni. Ever since Principal Fontana found me and commenced to bless my mail slot, monthly, with the Eastern Valley High School Alumni Newsletter, I've been meaning to pen my update. Sad to say, vanity slowed my hand. Let a fever for the truth speed it now. Let me stand on the rooftop of my reckoning and shout naught but the indisputable: I did not pan out.' The Eastern Valley High School alumni newsletter, Catamount Notes, is bursting with tales of success: we've got a bankable politician and a famous baseball star, not to mention a major label recording artist. And then there is the appalling, somewhat bitter and yet entirely loveable Lewis Miner, class of '89 -- who did not pan out. From perhaps the most gifted of the younger generation of US satirical novelists, Home Land is a marvel of playful prose and sustained invention -- and very, very funny.",

    "description": "<i>The Good Conscience</i> is Carlos Fuentes's second novel. The scene is Guanajuato, a provincial capital in Central Mexico, once one of the world's richest mining centers. The Ceballos family has been reinstated to power, and adolescent Jaime Ceballos, its only heir, is torn between the practical reality of his family's life and the idealism of his youth and his Catholic education. His father is a good man but weak; his uncle is powerful, yet his actions are inconsistent with his professed beliefs. Jaime's struggle to emerge as a man with a \"good conscience\" forms the theme of the book: can a rebel correct the evils of an established system and at the same time retain the integrity of his principles?",

This time they are heading to the blazing plains of Kenya, where Alex's grandmother Kate is writing an article about the first elephant-led safaris in Africa. Days into the tour, a Catholic missionary approaches the camp in search of companions who have mysteriously disappeared.<br /><br />As the group investigates, they discover a clan of Pygmies and a harsh world of corruption, slavery, and poaching. Alexander and Nadia must trust in the strength of their totemic animal spirits as they launch a spectacular struggle to restore freedom to the Pygmies and return leadership to its rightful hands.",

    "description": "A swashbuckling adventure story that reveals for the first time how Diego de la Vega became the masked man we all know so well Born in southern California late in the eighteenth century, Diego de la Vega is a child of two worlds. His father is an aristocratic Spanish military man turned landowner; his mother, a Shoshone warrior. At the age of sixteen, Diego is sent to Spain, a country chafing under the corruption of Napoleonic rule. He soon joins La Justicia, a secret underground resistance movement devoted to helping the powerless and the poor. Between the New World and the Old, the persona of Zorro is formed, a great hero is born, and the legend begins. After many adventures -- duels at dawn, fierce battles with pirates at sea, and impossible rescues -- Diego de la Vega, a.k.a. Zorro, returns to America to reclaim the hacienda on which he was raised and to seek justice for all who cannot fight for it themselves.",

Suddenly a terrible explosion lights up the sky. Grabbing the camera, the couple flees as approaching police cars speed toward the scene. Five years later, the crash of TWA Flight 800 has been attributed to a mechanical malfunction. But for John Corey and Kate Mayfield, both members of the elite Anti-terrorist Task Force, the case is not closed. Suspecting a cover-up at the highest levels and disobeying orders, they set out to find the one piece of evidence that will prove the truth about what really happened to Flight 800 - the videotape that shows a couple making love on the beach and the last moments of the doomed airliner.",

    "description": "National best seller and <i>Today</i> show Book Club selection, <i>Broken for You</i> is the story of two women in self-imposed exile whose lives are transformed when their paths intersect. Stephanie Kallos's debut novel is a work of infinite charm, wit and heart. It is also a glorious homage to the beauty of broken things. <br /><br />When we meet septuagenarian Margaret Hughes, she is living alone in a mansion in Seattle with only a massive collection of valuable antiques for company. Enter Wanda Schultz, a young woman with a broken heart who has come west to search for her wayward boyfriend. Both women are guarding dark secrets and have spent many years building up protective armor against the outside world. As their tentative friendship evolves, the armor begins to fall away and Margaret opens her house to the younger woman. This launches a series of unanticipated events, leading Margaret to discover a way to redeem her cursed past, and Wanda to learn the true purpose of her cross-country journey. <br /><br />Both funny and heartbreaking, <i>Broken for You</i> is a testament to the saving graces of surrogate families and shows how far the tiniest repair jobs can go in righting the world's wrongs.",

    "description": "<b>Journalist Susan Casey joins a strange band of surfer-scientists on a remote island off the California coast for some close encounters with the jaws of the world's most mysterious and fearsome predators in the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, <i>The Devil's Teeth: A True Story of Obsession and Survival Among America's Great White Sharks</i>.</b><br /><br />Susan Casey was in her living room when she first saw the great white sharks of the Farallon Islands, their dark fins swirling around a small motorboat in a documentary. These sharks were the alphas among alphas, some longer than twenty feet, and there were too many to count; even more incredible, this congregation was taking place just twenty-seven miles off the coast of San Francisco.<br /><br />In a matter of months, Casey was being hoisted out of the early-winter swells on a crane, up a cliff face to the barren surface of Southeast Farallon Island-dubbed by sailors in the 1850s the \"devil's teeth.\" There she joined Scot Anderson and Peter Pyle, the two biologists who bunk down during shark season each fall in the island's one habitable building, a haunted, 135-year-old house spackled with lichen and gull guano. Two days later, she got her first glimpse of the famous, terrifying jaws up close and she was instantly hooked; her fascination soon yielded to obsession-and an invitation to return for a full season. But as Casey readied herself for the eight-week stint, she had no way of preparing for what she would find among the dangerous, forgotten islands that have banished every campaign for civilization in the past two hundred years.<br /><br /><i>The Devil's Teeth</i> is a vivid dispatch from an otherworldly outpost, a story of crossing the boundary between society and an untamed place where humans are neither wanted nor needed.",

    "description": "In Paris, a physicist dies after performing a laboratory experiment for a beautiful visitor. In the jungles of Malaysia, a mysterious buyer purchases deadly cavitation technology, built to his specifications. In Vancouver, a small research submarine is leased for use in the waters off New Guinea. And in Tokyo, an intelligence agent tries to understand what it all means. Thus begins Michael Crichton's exciting and provocative technothriller, State of Fear. Only Michael Crichton's unique ability to blend science fact and pulse-pounding fiction could bring such disparate elements to a heart-stopping conclusion. This is Michael Crichton's most wide-ranging thriller. State of Fear takes the reader from the glaciers of Iceland to the volcanoes of Antarctica, from the Arizona desert to the deadly jungles of the Solomon Islands, from the streets of Paris to the beaches of Los Angeles. The novel races forward, taking the reader on a rollercoaster thrill ride, all the while keeping the brain in high gear. Gripping and thought-provoking, State of Fear is Michael Crichton at his very best.",

    "description": "Hemingway's Pulitzer Prize-winning classic <br /><br /><i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> is one of Hemingway's most enduring works. Told in language of great simplicity and power, it is the story of an old Cuban fisherman, down on his luck, and his supreme ordeal -- a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Here Hemingway recasts, in strikingly contemporary style, the classic theme of courage in the face of defeat, of personal triumph won from loss. Written in 1952, this hugely successful novella confirmed his power and presence in the literary world and played a large part in his winning the 1954 Nobel Prize for literature. <br /><br /><b>Ernest Hemingway</b> did more to change the style of English prose than any other writer in the twentieth century, and for his efforts he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1954. Hemingway wrote in short, declarative sentences and was known for his tough, terse prose. Publication of <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> and <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> immediately established Ernest Hemingway as one of the greatest literary lights of the twentieth century. As part of the expatriate community in 1920s Paris, the former journalist and World War I ambulance driver began a career that lead to international fame. Hemingway was an aficionado of bullfighting and big-game hunting, and his main protagonists were always men and women of courage and conviction, who suffered unseen scars, both physical and emotional. He covered the Spanish Civil War, portraying it in fiction in his brilliant novel <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i>, and he subsequently covered World War II. His classic novella <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. He died in 1961.",

    "description": "Does a god exist? This question has undoubtedly been asked, in one form or another, since man has had the ability to communicate. . . Thousands of volumes have been written on the subject of a god, and the vast majority have answered the questions with a resounding 'Yes!' \"<br /><br />\"You are about to read a minority viewpoint.\"<br /><br />With this intriguing introduction, George H. Smith sets out to demolish what he considers the most widespread and destructive of all the myths devised by man - the concept of a supreme being. With painstaking scholarship and rigorous arguments, Mr. Smith examines, dissects, and refutes the myriad \"proofs\" offered by theists - the defenses of sophisticated, professional theologians, as well as the average religious layman. He explores the historical and psychological havoc wrought by religion in general - and concludes that religious belief cannot have any place in the life of modern, rational man.<br /><br />\"It is not my purpose to convert people to atheism . . . (but to) demonstrate that the belief in God is irrational to the point of absurdity. If a person wishes to continue believing in a god, that is his prerogative, but he can no longer excuse his belief in the name of reason and moral necessity.",

    "description": "The only thing Shane cares about is leaving. Usually on a Greyhound bus, right before his life falls apart again. Just like he planned. But this time it's complicated: there's a sadistic corporate climber who thinks she's his girlfriend, a rent-subsidized affair with his landlord's wife, and the bizarrely appealing deaf assistant to Shane's cosmically unstable dentist. <br /><br />When one of the women is murdered, and Shane is the only suspect who doesn't care enough to act like he didn't do it, the question becomes just how he'll clear the good name he never had and doesn't particularly want: his own.<br />",

Dans l'atelier du peintre qui r\u00e9alise son portrait, il rencontre lord Henry Wotton, un dandy cynique imm\u00e9diatement s\u00e9duit par sa fra\u00eecheur. En contemplant son image sur la toile, Dorian prend subitement conscience que sa beaut\u00e9 n'est qu'\u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re. Il souhaite alors que ce soit le portrait qui accuse les marques du temps et non son visage. Les jours qui suivent, Dorian ne quitte plus lord Henry, qui exerce une influente grandissante sur lui. Une nuit, le jeune homme commet un acte d'une grande cruaut\u00e9. De retour chez lui, il remarque un l\u00e9ger changement sur le portrait... <br />En bonus : les in\u00e9dits de GEO. Pour d\u00e9couvrir l'\u0153uvre et son auteur \u00e0 travers un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 et une biographie. Pour mieux conna\u00eetre et comprendre le monde qui nous entoure des enqu\u00eates et des documents riches et passionnants autour des th\u00e8mes de l'\u0153uvre. Une nouvelle aventure commence... Dorian Gray subit l'ascendant n\u00e9faste d'un homme manipulateur. L'enfance et l'adolescence sont des moments de construction de la personnalit\u00e9 alors ouverte aux influences, et les publicitaires l'ont bien compris. Quelles sont donc leurs recettes pour s\u00e9duire cette classe d'\u00e2ge ? Avec son visage d'ange, Dorian est aim\u00e9 de tous. Il semblerait que la vie ne soit pas aussi facile pour les \" gueules cass\u00e9es \". Aujourd'hui, pour y rem\u00e9dier, nul besoin de signer un pacte avec le diable. La science peut reconstruire un visage et m\u00eame en greffer un nouveau ! Qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de tels progr\u00e8s ? Comment vivre avec le visage d'un autre ? \u00c0 travers l'\u00e9ternelle jeunesse, c'est l'immortalit\u00e9 que cherche Dorian. Cette qu\u00eate occupe les esprits depuis bien longtemps. Les recherches scientifiques actuelles veulent ouvrir les portes de l'\u00e9ternit\u00e9 aux vivants. Est-ce possible ?",

    "description": "Only a few nuclear weapons fell in America-the weapons that destroyed our nation were biological and, ultimately, cultural. But in the chaos, the famine, the plague, there exited a few pockets of order. The strongest of them was the state of Deseret, formed from the vestiges of Utah, Colorado, and Idaho. The climate has changed. The Great Salt Lake has filled up to prehistoric levels. But there, on the fringes, brave, hardworking pioneers are making the desert bloom again.<br /><br />A civilization cannot be reclaimed by powerful organizations, or even by great men alone. It must be renewed by individual men and women, one by one, working together to make a community, a nation, a new America.",

The progress of this spiritual odyssey involves him with some of Maugham's most brillant characters - his fiancee Isabel, whose choice between love and wealth have lifelong repercussions, and Elliot Templeton, her uncle, a classic expatriate American snob. The most ambitious of Maugham's novels, this is also one in which Maugham himself plays a considerable part as he wanders in and out of the story, to observe his characters struggling with their fates.",

    "description": "\"Nancy and Plum\" is a delightful old fashioned Christmas story about two sisters, Nancy, 10 and Plum, 8, whose parents died in an accident. Their only surviving relative is Uncle John, a wealthy bachelor with little patience or time for children. He puts the girls in Mrs. Monday's Boarding School in Heavenly Valley, persuaded by Mrs. Monday's promises and unctuous manner. <p>But Mrs. Monday is an ogre who pampers her niece, Maribelle, and persecutes the other girls in her custody. </p><p>Of the two sisters, Plum is the spunky one, leading Nancy on forays for food and initiating their running away. </p><p>There are lovely characters who are sympathetic and help the girls: Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, who find the girls on their farm and rescue them; Miss Waverly, the school teacher; Miss Appleby, the librarian, and Old Tom, the caretaker at the orphanage.</p>",

    "description": "In his most extraordinary book, \"one of the great clinical writers of the twentieth century\" (<i>The New York Times</i>) recounts the case histories of patients lost in the bizarre, apparently inescapable world of neurological disorders. Oliver Sacks's <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</i> tells the stories of individuals afflicted with fantastic perceptual and intellectual aberrations: patients who have lost their memories and with them the greater part of their pasts; who are no longer able to recognize people and common objects; who are stricken with violent tics and grimaces or who shout involuntary obscenities; whose limbs have become alien; who have been dismissed as retarded yet are gifted with uncanny artistic or mathematical talents.<br /><br />If inconceivably strange, these brilliant tales remain, in Dr. Sacks's splendid and sympathetic telling, deeply human. They are studies of life struggling against incredible adversity, and they enable us to enter the world of the neurologically impaired, to imagine with our hearts what it must be to live and feel as they do. A great healer, Sacks never loses sight of medicine's ultimate responsibility: \"the suffering, afflicted, fighting human subject.\"",

In the three-volume edition, the novels are titled \"<i>The Vicomte de Bragelonne</i>\", \"<i>Louise de la Valli\u00e8re</i>\" and \"<i>The Man in the Iron Mask</i>\".

    "description": "Published in 1992 in Europe and distributed in the U.S., the first book with photographs by Francesca Woodman immediately created great respect for this enigmatic artist. David Levi Strauss writes in his essay: \"The constitutive facts of Francesca Woodman's life are by now well known. We know that she was born in 1958, that she began taking photographs seriously at age thirteen or fourteen and continued this involvement into her twenty-second year, building up, in this brief time, a remarkably coherent and affecting body of work. And we know that on January 19, 1981, just two and a half months before her twenty-third birthday, she took her own life, leaping from a window on the Lower East Side in Manhattan to her death\". This volume, containing many unpublished images, finally allows us to discover the full body of work of this artist, created in Rhode Island, Rome, New York, MacDowell Colony, New Hampshire: self-portraits, mise-en-scenes, nudes, and deeply emotional collage-like images. They all show her intense relation with the camera and her own self, long before this kind of picture-making became fashionable.",

    "description": "The roots of alcoholism in the life of a brilliant daughter of an upper-class family are explored in this stylistic, literary memoir of drinking by a Massachusetts journalist. <br /><br />Caroline Knapp describes how the distorted world of her well-to-do parents pushed her toward anorexia and alcoholism. Fittingly, it was literature that saved her: she found inspiration in Pete Hamill's 'A Drinking Life' and sobered up. Her tale is spiced up with the characters she has known along the way. <br /><br />A journalist describes her twenty years as a functioning alcoholic, explaining how she used alcohol to escape personal relationships and the realities of life until a series of personal crises forced her to confront her problem.",

    "description": "After a violent storm in the South Pacific in the year 1643, Roberto della Griva finds himself shipwrecked-on a ship. Swept from the Amaryllis, he has managed to pull himself aboard the Daphne, anchored in the bay of a beautiful island. The ship is fully provisioned, he discovers, but the crew is missing. <br /><br />As Roberto explores the different cabinets in the hold, he remembers chapters from his youth: Ferrante, his imaginary evil brother; the siege of Casale, that meaningless chess move in the Thirty Years' War in which he lost his father and his illusions; and the lessons given him on Reasons of State, fencing, the writing of love letters, and blasphemy.<br /><br />In this fascinating, lyrical tale, Umberto Eco tells of a young dreamer searching for love and meaning; and of a most amazing old Jesuit who, with his clocks and maps, has plumbed the secrets of longitudes, the four moons of Jupiter, and the Flood.<br />",

Focusing on the mysteries\u2014romantic, scientific, literary\u2014that engage the minds and hearts of characters whose passions and lives intersect across scientific planes and centuries, it is \u201cStoppard\u2019s richest, most ravishing comedy to date, a play of wit, intellect, language, brio and . . . emotion. It\u2019s like a dream of levitation: you\u2019re instantaneously aloft, soaring, banking, doing loop-the-loops and then, when you think you\u2019re about to plummet to earth, swooping to a gentle touchdown of not easily described sweetness and sorrow . . . Exhilarating\u201d (Vincent Canby, The New York Times).<br />",

    "description": "Here is the shocking true saga of the Irish American mob. In <em>Paddy Whacked</em>, bestselling author and organized crime expert T. J. English brings to life nearly two centuries of Irish American gangsterism, which spawned such unforgettable characters as Mike \"King Mike\" McDonald, Chicago's subterranean godfather; Big Bill Dwyer, New York's most notorious rumrunner during Prohibition; Mickey Featherstone, troubled Vietnam vet turned Westies gang leader; and James \"Whitey\" Bulger, the ruthless and untouchable Southie legend. Stretching from the earliest New York and New Orleans street wars through decades of bootlegging scams, union strikes, gang wars, and FBI investigations, <em>Paddy Whacked</em> is a riveting tour de force that restores the Irish American gangster to his rightful preeminent place in our criminal history -- and penetrates to the heart of the American experience.",

His Moscow homecoming is anything but peaceful. In the hotel where he and his loyal if impertinent manservant Masa are staying, Fandorin\u2019s old war-hero friend General Michel Sobolev (\u201cAchilles\u201d to the crowd) has been found dead, felled in his armchair by an apparent heart attack. But Fandorin suspects an unnatural cause. His suspicions lead him to the boudoir of the beautiful singer\u2013\u201cnot exactly a courtesan\u201d\u2013known as Wanda. Apparently, in Wanda\u2019s bed, the general secretly breathed his last. . . .",

    "description": "A natural history rich in observation of the animal world and how humans participate in it, <i>Silent Thunder</i> is also a passionate story of scientist Katy Payne's spiritual quest as she turns a keen eye on her role in this world. Starting with the story of her revolutionary discovery that elephants use infrasonic sounds--sounds below the range of human hearing--to communicate, Payne shares what she learned from her fascinating field research in Africa, research that reveals new insights into elephants' social lives. When five of the elephant families she studies are the victims of culling, Payne's approach to her research changes, as she fights valiantly to protect the elephants. The result of her research, and the touching insights gained from Africans she worked with and the elephants she studied, give a vivid impression of Payne's view from the front lines of the natural preservation effort. Like Peter Matthiessen's <i>The Snow Leopard</i> and the writings of Jane Goodall, <i>Silent Thunder</i> demonstrates how a commitment to all life can bring one's own into a new focus.",

(See <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/56916-the-crow-tundra-press\">The Crow (Tundra Press)</a> for the three volume set)\n    \n    Following the success of <i>The Crow</i> graphic novel, Kitchen Sink Press published additional installments by other writers.  Each of these installments were originally published as 3 or 4 single issues.\n    \n    Each of the following graphic novels (i.e. trades) collects an installment of <i>The Crow</i> comic series from Kitchen Sink Press.\n    \n    There were two additional installments of <i>The Crow</i> released by Kitchen Sink Press: \"Waking Nightmares\" Vol. 1-4 and \"City of Angels\" Vol. 1-3.  These have not been released in trade format, and therefore are not listed below.\n    \n    Shortly after the demise of Kitchen Sink Press and their line of Crow comics, Image Comics released a new Crow comic series, <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/56933-the-crow-image-comics\">The Crow (Image Comics)</a>.\n    \n    \n    Other <i>The Crow</i> comic series include:\n    \n    <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/56916-the-crow-tundra-press\">The Crow (Tundra Press)</a>\n    <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/56933-the-crow-image-comics\">The Crow (Image Comics)</a>\n    \n    There have also been several full text novels written in The Crow universe.\n    \n    <A href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/56919-the-crow-novels\">The Crow Novels</a>",

    "description": "Abandoned pregnant and penniless on the teeming streets of London, 16-year-old Amber St. Clare manages, by using her wits, beauty, and courage, to climb to the highest position a woman could achieve in Restoration England-that of favorite mistress of the Merry Monarch, Charles II. From whores and highwaymen to courtiers and noblemen, from events such as the Great Plague and the Fire of London to the intimate passions of ordinary-and extraordinary-men and women, Amber experiences it all. But throughout her trials and escapades, she remains, in her heart, true to the one man she really loves, the one man she can never have. <br /><br />Frequently compared to <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, <i>Forever Amber</i> is the other great historical romance, outselling every other American novel of the 1940s-despite being banned in Boston for its sheer sexiness. A book to read and reread, this edition brings back to print an unforgettable romance and a timeless masterpiece.",

Along the way he reflects on the American character, racial hostility, the particular form of American loneliness he finds almost everywhere, and the unexpected kindness of strangers.",

    "description": "The Matrix conveys the horror of a false world made of nothing but perceptions. Based on the premise that reality is a dream controlled by malevolent forces, it is one of the most overtly philosophical movies ever to come out of Hollywood. These thought-provoking essays by the same team of young philosophers who created <i>The Simpsons and Philosophy</i> discuss different facets of the primary philosophical puzzle of The Matrix: Can we be sure the world is really there, and if not, what should we do about it? Other chapters address issues of religion, lifestyle, pop culture, the Zeitgeist, the nature of mind and matter, and the reality of fiction.",

    "description": "With his unique knack for making cutting-edge theoretical science effortlessly accessible, world-renowned physicist Paul Davies now tackles an issue that has boggled minds for centuries: Is time travel possible? The answer, insists Davies, is definitely yes--once you iron out a few kinks in the space-time continuum. With tongue placed firmly in cheek, Davies explains the theoretical physics that make visiting the future and revisiting the past possible, then proceeds to lay out a four-stage process for assembling a time machine and making it work. Wildly inventive and theoretically sound, <b>How to Build a Time Machine</b> is creative science at its best--illuminating, entertaining, and thought provoking.",

    "description": "Back in America after twenty years in Britain, Bill Bryson decided to reacquaint himself with his native country by walking the 2,100-mile Appalachian Trail, which stretches from Georgia to Maine. The AT offers an astonishing landscape of silent forests and sparkling lakes<b>\u2014</b>and to a writer with the comic genius of Bill Bryson, it also provides endless opportunities to witness the majestic silliness of his fellow human beings.<br /><br />For a start there's the gloriously out-of-shape Stephen Katz, a buddy from Iowa along for the walk. Despite Katz's overwhelming desire to find cozy restaurants, he and Bryson eventually settle into their stride, and while on the trail they meet a bizarre assortment of hilarious characters. But <i>A Walk in the Woods</i> is more than just a laugh-out-loud hike. Bryson's acute eye is a wise witness to this beautiful but fragile trail, and as he tells its fascinating history, he makes a moving plea for the conservation of America's last great wilderness. An adventure, a comedy, and a celebration, <i>A Walk in the Woods</i> has become\u00a0a modern classic of travel literature.",

    "description": "In the early 1990s three young people attracted to the ambitious global peacekeeping work of the UN cross paths in Cambodia. Andrew strives for a better world through his life-saving work as a doctor. Heidi, a social worker, is in need of a challenge and a paycheck, and Ken is fresh from Harvard and brimful of idealism. As their stories interweave through the years, from Rwanda, Bosnia and Somalia to Haiti, the trio reveal a world of witnessed atrocities, primal fear, desperate loneliness and base desires. They fend off terror and futility with revelry, humour and sex; ask hard questions about the world order America has created, the true power of the UN, and whether there is any possibility for change.<br /><br />This is a startling celebration of the power of humour and friendship, of the limits of human compassion, and the need for a warm body and a cold beer during a Condition Echo lockdown. A book that shows the human cost of global politics and the tragic truth that wars are much more avoidable than our governments would ever admit. A brilliant, provocatively funny and fast moving book.",

It is intimacy.\"<br /><br />\"Look in a mirror and one thing's sure: what we see is not who we are.\"<br /><br />\"Next to God, love is the word most mangled in every language. The highest form of regard between two people is friendship, and when love enters, friendship dies.\"<br /><br />\"There are no mistakes. The events we bring upon ourselves, no matter how unpleasant, are necessary in order to learn what we need to learn; whatever steps we take, they're necessary to reach the places we've chosen to go.\"",

    "description": "Every April, when the wind blows from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. <br /><br />A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out. Landon would never have dreamed of it. <br /><br />Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood...<br /><br /><i>Did You Know?-<br /><br />That Jamie was named after Nicholas's editor, Jamie Raab?<br /><br />That Landon is the name of his third son?<br /><br />That Nicholas Sparks recorded his own reading for the audio version of the novel?</i>",

But what of her stepsisters, the homely pair exiled into ignominy by the fame of their lovely sibling? What fate befell those untouched by beauty ... and what curses accompanied Cinderella's looks?<br /><br />Set against the backdrop of seventeenth-century Holland, <i>Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister</i> tells the story of Iris, an unlikely heroine who finds herself swept from the lowly streets of Haarlem to a strange world of wealth, artifice, and ambition. Iris's path quickly becomes intertwined with that of Clara, the mysterious and unnaturally beautiful girl destined to become her sister. While Clara retreats to the cinders of the family hearth, Iris seeks out the shadowy secrets of her new household -- and the treacherous truth of her former life.",

There's Eric, fiercely protective of his brother Mickey-but he has a secret that holds together his past and future. Sonia, struggling to live the life of a good Muslim girl in a foreign America. Gingerbread and Keisha, who fall in love despite themselves. <i>Life Is Funny</i> strips away the defenses of one group of teenagers living today, right now-and shows their unbearably real lives.<br /><br />\"First novelist Frank breaks new ground with a realistic, lyrical novel about eleven teens in Brooklyn now . . . Their talk is painful, rough, sexy, funny, fearful, furious, gentle. Each chapter, each vignette within a chapter, builds to its own climax, and the stories weave together to surprise you.\" (<i>Booklist</i>, starred review)<br /><br />\"An astounding first effort.\" (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, pointer review)",

    "description": "<i>Founders at Work: Stories of Startups' Early Days</i> is a collection of interviews with founders of famous technology companies about what happened in the very earliest days. These people are celebrities now. What was it like when they were just a couple friends with an idea? Founders like Steve Wozniak (Apple), Caterina Fake (Flickr), Mitch Kapor (Lotus), Max Levchin (PayPal), and Sabeer Bhatia (Hotmail) tell you in their own words about their surprising and often very funny discoveries as they learned how to build a company.<br /><br />Where did they get the ideas that made them rich? How did they convince investors to back them? What went wrong, and how did they recover?<br /><br />Nearly all technical people have thought of one day starting or working for a startup. For them, this book is the closest you can come to being a fly on the wall at a successful startup, to learn how it's done.<br /><br />But ultimately these interviews are required reading for anyone who wants to understand business, because startups are business reduced to its essence. The reason their founders become rich is that startups do what businesses do--create value--more intensively than almost any other part of the economy. How? What are the secrets that make successful startups so insanely productive? Read this book, and let the founders themselves tell you.",

    "description": "On January 28, 1945, 121 hand-selected U.S. troops slipped behind enemy lines in the Philippines. Their mission: March thirty rugged miles to rescue 513 POWs languishing in a hellish camp, among them the last survivors of the infamous Bataan Death March. A recent prison massacre by Japanese soldiers elsewhere in the Philippines made the stakes impossibly high and left little time to plan the complex operation.<br /><br />In <b>Ghost Soldiers</b> Hampton Sides vividly re-creates this daring raid, offering a minute-by-minute narration that unfolds alongside intimate portraits of the prisoners and their lives in the camp. Sides shows how the POWs banded together to survive, defying the Japanese authorities even as they endured starvation, tropical diseases, and torture. Harrowing, poignant, and inspiring, <b>Ghost Soldiers</b> is the mesmerizing story of a remarkable mission. It is also a testament to the human spirit, an account of enormous bravery and self-sacrifice amid the most trying conditions.",

Babel was best known for his mastery of the short story form\u2014in which he ranks alongside Kafka and Hemingway\u2014but his career was tragically cut short when he was murdered by Stalin's secret police. Edited by his daughter Nathalie Babel and translated by award-winner Peter Constantine, this paperback edition includes the stunning <em>Red Cavalry Stories; The Odessa Tales</em>, featuring the legendary gangster Benya Krik; and the tragic later stories, including \"Guy de Maupassant.\" This will be the standard edition of Babel's stories for years to come.",

    "description": "Breece D'J Pancake cut short a remarkably promising writing career when he took his own life in 1979 at the age of 26. In 1983 Little, Brown and Company's posthumous publication of this book electrified the literary world with a force that still resounds across two decades. A collection of stories that depict the world of Pancake's native rural West Virginia with astonishing power and grace, <i>The Stories of Breece D'J Pancake</i> has remained continuously in print and is a perennial favorite among aspiring writers, participants in creative writing programs, and students of contemporary American fiction. \"Trilobites\", the first of Pancake's stories to be published in The Atlantic, elicited an extraordinary immediate response from readers and continues to be widely anthologized.",

    "description": "This revised and expanded version of Walk On: The Spiritual Journey of U2 tackles the issues and questions everyone desires to know about the world's most popular rock band. Throughout Walk On, Steve Stockman follows the band from their early days in Dublin's Shalom Christian Fellowship all the way to their most recent album and world tour. Fortunately, Bono has never been more outspoken about his faith and the Church than he has in the past few years. From his involvement with fighting AIDS in Africa through the DATA organization to his quoting Psalms from the Superbowl stage, Bono is doing God's work in a very public and very vocal way.",

They regard their disappointment in him as an act of betrayal on his part, and react violently.",

A man sees his favorite elephant vanish into thin air; a newlywed couple suffers attacks of hunger that drive them to hold up a McDonald's in the middle of the night; and a young woman discovers that she has become irresistible to a little green monster who burrows up through her backyard.<br /><br />By turns haunting and hilarious, <i>The Elephant Vanishes</i> is further proof of Murakami's ability to cross the border between separate realities -- and to come back bearing treasure.",

    "description": "Begun in the autumn of 1957 and published posthumously in 1964, Ernest Hemingway's <i>A Moveable Feast</i> captures what it meant to be young and poor and writing in Paris during the 1920s. A correspondent for the <i>Toronto Star,</i> Hemingway arrived in Paris in 1921, three years after the trauma of the Great War and at the beginning of the transformation of Europe's cultural landscape: Braque and Picasso were experimenting with cubist form; James Joyce, long living in self-imposed exile from his native Dublin, had just completed <i>Ulysses;</i> Gertrude Stein held court at 27 Rue de Fleurus, and deemed young Ernest a member of <i>une gneration perdue;</i> and T.S. Eliot was a bank clerk in London. It was during these years that the as-of-yet unpublished young writer gathered the material for his first novel <i>The Sun Also Rises,</i> and the subsequent masterpieces that followed.<br /><p>Among these small, reflective sketches are unforgettable encounters with the members of Hemingway's slightly rag-tag circle of artists and writers, some also fated to achieve fame and glory, others to fall into obscurity. Here, too, is an evocation of the Paris that Hemingway knew as a young man - a map drawn in his distinct prose of the streets and cafes and bookshops that comprised the city in which he, as a young writer, sometimes struggling against the cold and hunger of near poverty, honed the skills of his craft.<br /></p><p><i>A Moveable Feast</i> is at once an elegy to the remarkable group for expatriates that gathered in Paris during the twenties and a testament to the risks and rewards of the writerly life.</p>",

    "description": "Alex-Li Tandem sells autographs. His business is to hunt for names on paper, collect them, sell them, and occasionally fake them\u2014all to give the people what they want: a little piece of Fame. But what does Alex want? Only the return of his father, the end of religion, something for his headache, three different girls, infinite grace, and the rare autograph of forties movie actress Kitty Alexander. With fries.<br /><br /><b>The Autograph Man</b> is a deeply funny existential tour around the hollow trappings of modernity: celebrity, cinema, and the ugly triumph of symbol over experience. It offers further proof that Zadie Smith is one of the most staggeringly talented writers of her generation.<i>\n  <br /></i>",

In this extraordinary novel, Tova Mirvis takes us into the fascinating and insular world of the Memphis Orthodox Jews, one ripe with tradition and contradiction. Warm and wise, enchanting and funny, The Ladies Auxiliary brilliantly illuminates the timeless struggle between mothers and daughters, family and self, religious freedom and personal revelation, honoring the past and facing the future. An unforgettable story of uncommon atmosphere, profound insight, and winning humor, The Ladies Auxiliary is a triumphant work of fiction.",

    "description": "This novel of Mark Twain's, <i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i>, gives us an odd view of the American literary genius: it shows is bent twoward science fictional. Twain wrote the book as a burlesque of Romantic notions of chivalry after being inspired by a dream in which he was a knight himself and severely inconvenienced by the weight and cumbersome nature of his armor.<br /><br />A Yankee engineer from Connecticut is accidentally transported back in time to the court of King Arthur, where he fools the inhabitants of that time into thinking he is a magician and soon uses his knowledge of modern technology to become a \"magician\" in earnest, stunning the English of the Early Middle Ages with such feats as demolitions, fireworks and the shoring up of a holy well. Twain's fascination appears in his time traveler (from contemporary America, yet!), using his knowledge of science to introduce modern technology to Arthurian England. As with all works of a master like Twain, we highly recommend this novel - but just between us, this book is a lot of fun, too. Go ahead, read it now.",

    "description": "From the Autobiography of Tiberius Claudius, Born 10 B.C., Murdered and Deified A.D. 54. <br /><br />Set in the first century A.D. in Rome and written as an autobiographical memoir, this colorful story of the life of the Roman emperor Claudius stands as one of the modern classics of historical fiction.<br /><br />Physically weak and afflicted with stuttering, Claudius is initially despised and dismissed as an idiot. Shunted to the background of imperial affairs by his embarrassed royal family, he becomes a scholar and historian, while palace intrigues and murders surround him. Observing these dramas from beyond the public eye, Claudius escapes the cruelties inflicted on the rest of the royal family by its own members and survives to become emperor of Rome in A.D. 41.",

Author of pervious studies of Joyce, T.S. Eliot, Wyndham Lewis and Pound (to name a few), Kenner bestrides modern literature if not like a colossus then at least a presence of formidable proportions. A new book by him is certainly an event....A demanding, enticing book that glitters at the same time it antagonizes....\"<i>The Pound Era</i>\u00a0presents us with an idiosyncratic but sharply etched skeletal view of our immediate literary heritage.\"\u2014<i>The New York Times</i>",

Within them was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. <br /><br />Thereafter, the unsullied Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils, but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, which was guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. <br /><br />The Silmarillion is the history of the rebellion of F\u00ebanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all their heroism, against the great Enemy.",

Charley Floyd, a good-looking, sweet-smiling country boy from Oklahoma, is about to rob his first armored car. <br /> Written by Pulitzer Prize winner Larry McMurtry and his writing partner, Diana Ossana, <i>Pretty Boy Floyd</i> traces the wild career of this legendary American folk hero, a young man so charming that it's hard not to like him, even as he's robbing you at gunpoint. From the bank heists and shootings that make him Public Enemy Number One to the women who love him, from the glamour-hungry nation that worships him to the G-men who track Charley down, <i>Pretty Boy Floyd</i> is both a richly comic masterpiece and an American tragedy about the price of fame and the corruption of innocence.",

    "description": "Exploring the world of plants and its relation to mankind as revealed by the latest discoveries of scientists, <i>The Secret Life of Plants</i> includes remarkable information about plants as lie detectors and plants as ecological sentinels; it describes their ability to adapt to human wishes, their response to music, their curative powers, and their ability to communicate with man. Authors Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird suggest that the most far-reaching revolution of the 20th century \u2014 one that could save or destroy the planet \u2014 may come from the bottom of your garden.<br /><br />\"<i>Almost incredible ... bristles with plenty of hard facts and astounding scientific and practical lore.</i>\" <br />\u2014S. K. Oberbeck, Newsweek<br /><br />\u201c<i>This fascinating book roams ... over that marvelous no man's land of mystical glimmerings into the nature of science and life itself.</i>\" <br />\u2014Henry Mitchell, Washington Post Book World<br /><br />\u201c<i>If I can't \u2018get inside a plant\u2019 or \u2018feel emanations\u2019 from a plant and don't know anyone else who can. that doesn't detract one whit from the possibility that some people can and do. . . .<br />According to The Secret Life of Plants, plants and men do inter-relate, with plants exhibiting empathetic and spiritual relationships and showing reactions interpreted as demonstrating physical-force connections with men. As my students say, \u2018hey, wow!\u2019</i>\"<br />\u2014Richard M. Klein, Professor of Botany, University of Vermont (in Smithsonian)",

    "description": "<b>Andrew George's \"masterly new translation\" (<i>The Times</i>) of the world's first truly great work of literature<br /></b><br />Miraculously preserved on clay tablets dating back as much as four thousand years, the poem of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, is the world\u2019s oldest epic, predating Homer by many centuries. The story tells of Gilgamesh\u2019s adventures with the wild man Enkidu, and of his arduous journey to the ends of the earth in quest of the Babylonian Noah and the secret of immortality. Alongside its themes of family, friendship and the duties of kings, the\u00a0<i>Epic of Gilgamesh</i>\u00a0is, above all, about mankind\u2019s eternal struggle with the fear of death.<br /><br />The Babylonian version has been known for over a century, but linguists are still deciphering new fragments in Akkadian and Sumerian. Andrew George\u2019s gripping translation brilliantly combines these into a fluent narrative and will long rank as the definitive English\u00a0Gilgamesh.<br /><br />For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700\u00a0titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the\u00a0series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date\u00a0translations by award-winning translators.",

    "description": "Mike Monaghan is the bartender at the Engine Room, a meeting place for the small but thriving community of gay men in Cold Falls, New York. As Mike pours beer, wipes glasses and hears everything, he's also witness to the men who come here looking for what they need--sex, direction, friendship, spiritual fulfillment, and love. People like: <br /> Stephen Darby--As an accountant, he knows many secrets. But Stephen has his own secret, one he's never been able to share with anyone close to him. Being the perfect son costs him dearly, and now it may take from him the one man he longs for. <br /> Pete Thayer--Playing it straight, Pete takes out his frustrations on transmissions and engines during the day, then spends his nights trying to quench his needs through anonymous sex. But once the thrill of the forbidden begins to fade, what will he be left with? <br /> John and Russell--The golden couple in town has the ideal relationship everyone wants. But behind the scenes, their storybook marriage is on the verge of facing some explosive trials that will shake both men completely. <br /> Father Thomas Dunn--More and more the gentle priest is feeling a need to express the secret desires that conflict with his devotion to the church, sending his faith into a tailspin and making him question what he really wants from life. <br /> Simon Bird--He's a fixture in town, an old queen everyone finds amusing and entertaining. Still mourning the loss of his longtime lover, Simon yearns to find love and a place in a culture that worships youth and beauty. <br /> As Mike hands these men their drinks, he marvels at their determination, strength and foolishness. But most of all, he begins to question his own dissatisfaction, pondering what's missing from his own life, and what risks he may have to take to find fulfillment. \"Looking For It\" is an extraordinarily human tale of community, friendship, and the search for happiness. With unflinching honesty, keen insight, and his trademark humor, Michael Thomas Ford weaves together the unforgettable stories of these seven men, chronicling their dreams, hurts, heartbreaks, joys, and hopes, while taking readers on an emotional journey to find what it is we're all looking for.",

    "description": "<i>Special Topics in Calamity Physics</i> is a darkly hilarious coming-of-age novel and a richly plotted suspense tale told through the distinctive voice of its heroine, Blue van Meer. After a childhood moving from one academic outpost to another with her father (a man prone to aphorisms and meteoric affairs), Blue is clever, deadpan, and possessed of a vast lexicon of literary, political, philosophical, and scientific knowledge\u2014and is quite the cineaste to boot. In her final year of high school at the elite (and unusual) St. Gallway School in Stockton, North Carolina, Blue falls in with a charismatic group of friends and their captivating teacher, Hannah Schneider. But when the drowning of one of Hannah's friends and the shocking death of Hannah herself lead to a confluence of mysteries, Blue is left to make sense of it all with only her gimlet-eyed instincts and cultural references to guide\u2014or misguide\u2014her.",

Praying God's Word is a topical prayer guide addressing fourteen strongholds and what Scripture reveals about each issue. The Scriptures are presented in prayer form to be incorporated into the daily prayer life as a way of letting God's Word, through prayer, help you overcome the strongholds of bitterness, anger, unforgiveness, and other areas as well.",

Rather, it is disruptive, courageous, and socially unacceptable. In <i>Bold Love</i>, Dr. Dan Allender and Dr. Tremper Longman III draw out the aggressive, unrelenting, passionate power of genuine love. Far from helping you \"get along\" with others, <i>Bold Love</i> introduces the outlandish possibility of making a significant, life-changing impact on family, friends, coworkers--even your enemies. Learn more about forgiveness, maturity, and seeing others through Jesus' eyes.",

    "description": "Virtually unobtainable for many years, these two books by Lewis Carroll (C. L. Dodgson) have now been reprinted in their entirety for the pleasure of modern enthusiasts of mathematical puzzles. Written by the 19th-century mathematician who gave us <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> and <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, they contain an unusual combination of wit and mathematical intricacy that will test your mathematical ingenuity and provide hours of stimulating entertainment.<br /><i>Pillow-Problems</i> is one of the rarest of all Lewis Carroll's works. It contains 72 mathematical posers ranging from those that can be solved by arithmetic, simple algebra, or plane geometry, to those that require more advanced algebra, trigonometry, algebraical geometry, differential calculus, and transcendental probabilities. Both numerical answers and fully worked out solutions are given, each in a separate section so that you can test your methods of problem-solving even after you have looked up the answer to a problem.<br />In <i>A Tangled Tale</i>, Carroll embodies some of his most perplexing mathematical puzzles in the ten knots or chapters of a delightful story that has all the charm and wit of his better-known works. The <i>Tale</i> was originally printed as a monthly magazine serial, and many readers sent in solutions to the problems that were posed in it. In the long Appendix to The <i>Tale</i>, which contains the answers and solutions to the problems, Carroll uses the answers sent in by readers as the basis for illuminating and entertaining discussions of the many wrong ways in which the problems can be attacked, as well as the right ways.",

This \u201cabounding, ebullient, effervescent emotion\u201d manifests itself everywhere from child\u2019s play to scientific breakthrough and is crucially important to learning, risk-taking, social cohesiveness, and survival itself. <b>Exuberance: The Passion for Life</b> introduces us to such notably irrepressible types as Teddy Roosevelt, John Muir, and Richard Feynman, as well as Peter Pan, dancing porcupines, and Charles Schulz\u2019s Snoopy. It explores whether exuberance can be inherited, parses its neurochemical grammar, and documents the methods people have used to stimulate it. The resulting book is an irresistible fusion of science and soul.",

    "description": "On May 2, 1973, Black Panther Assata Shakur (aka JoAnne Chesimard) lay in a hospital, close to death, handcuffed to her bed, while local, state, and federal police attempted to question her about the shootout on the New Jersey Turnpike that had claimed the life of a white state trooper. Long a target of J. Edgar Hoover's campaign to defame, infiltrate, and criminalize Black nationalist organizations and their leaders, Shakur was incarcerated for four years prior to her conviction on flimsy evidence in 1977 as an accomplice to murder.<br /><br />This intensely personal and political autobiography belies the fearsome image of JoAnne Chesimard long projected by the media and the state. With wit and candor, Assata Shakur recounts the experiences that led her to a life of activism and portrays the strengths, weaknesses, and eventual demise of Black and White revolutionary groups at the hand of\u00a0government officials. The result is a signal contribution to the literature about growing up Black in America that has already taken its place alongside <i>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</i> and the works of Maya Angelou.<br /><br />Two years after her conviction, Assata Shakur escaped from prison. She was given political asylum by Cuba, where she now resides.",

    "description": "With nearly a million copies sold, Joanna Weaver's popular book shows women how to blend intimacy with Jesus and service for Him.\u00a0 <br /><br /> An invitation for every woman who feels she isn't godly enough...isn't loving enough...isn't doing enough. The life of a woman today isn't really all that different from that of Mary and Martha in the New Testament.\u00a0Like Mary, you long to sit at the Lord's feet...but the daily demands of a busy world just won't leave you alone. Like Martha, you love Jesus and really want to serve him...yet you struggle with weariness, resentment, and feelings of inadequacy.<br /><br /> Then comes Jesus, right into the midst of your busy Mary/Martha life-and he extends the same invitation he issued long ago to the two sisters of Bethany. Tenderly he invites you to choose \"the better part\"-a joyful life of \"living-room\" intimacy with him that flows naturally into \"kitchen service\" for him.<br /><br /> How can you make that choice? With her fresh approach to the familiar Bible story and its creative, practical strategies, Joanna shows how all of us -Marys and Marthas alike- can draw closer to our Lord, deepening our devotion, strengthening our service, and doing both with less stress and greater joy.<br /><br /> This book includes a twelve-week Bible study.<br /><br /> Also look for the ten-week DVD study pack companion product to this book, which includes three DVDs and a separate, revised and expanded study guide.",

    "description": "Boston real estate agent William Collins knows that his habits are slipping out of control. Due to obsessive-compulsive daily cleaning binges and a penchant for nightly online cruising for hookups, he finds his sales figures slipping despite a booming market. There's also his ongoing struggle to collect the rent from his passive-aggressive tenant and his worries about his best friend, Edward, whom he's certainly <i>not</i> in love with. Just as he decides to do something about his life, he meets Charlotte and Samuel, wealthy suburbanites looking for the perfect city apartment. \"Happy couple,\" he writes in his notes. \"Maybe I can learn something from them.\" What he ultimately discovers challenges his own assumptions about real estate, love, and desire; and what they learn from him might unravel a budding friendship, not to mention a very promising sale. <br /><br /> Full of crackling dialogue delivered by a stellar ensemble of players, <i>Alternatives to Sex</i> is a smart, hilarious chronicle of life in post-traumatic, morally ambiguous America -- where the desire to do good is constantly being tripped up by the need to feel good. Right now.",

    "description": "Bestselling author Charles Todd has earned a special place among mystery\u2019s elite writers with his acclaimed series featuring Scotland Yard Inspector Ian Rutledge, a former soldier seeking to lay to rest the demons of his past in the aftermath of World War I. But that past bleeds into the present in a complex murder case that calls into question his own honor...and the crimes committed in the name of God, country, and righteous vengeance.<br /><br />In 1912 Ian Rutledge watched as a man was condemned to hang for the murders of elderly women. Rutledge helped gather the evidence that sent Ben Shaw to the gallows. And when justice was done, Rutledge closed the door on the case. But Shaw was not easily forgotten.<br /><br />Now, seven years later, that grim trial returns in the form of Ben Shaw\u2019s widow Nell, bringing Rutledge evidence she is convinced will prove her husband\u2019s innocence. It\u2019s a belief fraught with peril, threatening both Rutledge\u2019s professional stature and his faith in his judgment. But there is a darker reason for Rutledge\u2019s reluctance. Murder brings him back to Kent where, days earlier, he\u2019d glimpsed an all-too-familiar face beyond the leaping flames of a bonfire. Soon an unexpected encounter revives the end of his own war, as the country prepares for a somber commemoration on the anniversary of the Armistice. To battle the unsettled past and the haunted present at the same time is an appalling mandate. <br /><br />And the people around him? Among them the attractive widow of a friend, a remarkable woman who survived the Great Indian Mutiny; a bitter, dying barrister; and a man whose name he never knew\u2014unwittingly compete with the grieving Nell Shaw. They\u2019ll demand more than Rutledge can give, unaware that he is already carrying the burden of shell shock\u2014and the voice of Hamish MacLeod, the soldier he was forced to execute in the war. The killer in Marling is surprisingly adept at escaping detection. And Ben Shaw\u2019s past is a tangle of unsettling secrets that may or may not be true. Rutledge must walk a tortuous line between two murderers...one reaching out to ruin him, the other driven to destroy him.",

    "description": "Lust brings out the liar in everyone. Every erection has Pinocchio written up and down its length\u2014yes, everybody wants to be REAL, a real boy, an honest woman, unafraid and upright\u2014but then desire, the ultimate honesty, does us in. Desire doesn't give a whit about shame. Our secrets, our exaggerations and distractions, it's all just a lot of twisting in the wind as far as sex is concerned\u2014what we want WILL come out. <br />\"Is our sexuality a basic, good, and precious thing that somehow became terribly misunderstood? Or is there something really evil out there in Sex Land that attaches itself to our libidos and is only held back by vigilance and caution?\" asks Susie Bright in her bestselling book <i>The Sexual State of the Union.</i> Bright pushes the borders of propriety until they blur and become irrelevant in the face of our inherent need to touch and be touched. With candor and passion, Susie Bright proves that sexual knowledge can indeed be salvation and inspiration.",

And that's before the players even take the field.<br /><br />Nick Hornby has been a football fan since the moment he was conceived. Call it predestiny. Or call it preschool. <i>Fever Pitch</i> is his tribute to a lifelong obsession. Part autobiography, part comedy, part incisive analysis of insanity, Hornby's award-winning memoir captures the fever pitch of fandom \u2014 its agony and ecstasy, its community, its defining role in thousands of young mens' coming-of-age stories. <i>Fever Pitch</i> is one for the home team. But above all, it is one for everyone who knows what it really means to have a losing season.",

    "description": "\"To say that Babs has been my closest friend for sixteen years is rather like saying that Einstein was good at sums. We were blood sisters from the age of eleven (before my mother prized the razor out of Babs's hand).\"<br /><br />But now Babs, noisy and as fun as a day at the beach, is getting married. And Natalie Miller, twenty-seven, senior press officer for the London Ballet, panics. What happens when your best friend pledges everlasting love to someone else?<br /><br />It doesn't help that Nat is dating a guy named Saul Bowcock. As the confetti flutters, her good-girl veneer cracks, and she falls into an alluringly unsuitable affair that spins her crazily out of control. Nat is on the rebound and allergic to the truth\u2014about Babs's relationship, her boyfriend's ambition, her parents' divorce, and her golden-boy brother's little Australian secret. Her mother's lasagna and her roommate Andy's fuzzy slippers are also monstrous affronts. But what Nat really needs to face is the mirror\u2014and herself . . . .<br /><br />Wickedly witty and refreshingly honest, <em>Running in Heels</em> is a hilarious look at the lies we tell ourselves\u2014and the unwanted truths that only our best friends can tell us.",

    "description": "<b>From one of our most distinguished historians, an authoritative and vivid account of the devastating World War I battle that claimed more than 300,000 lives</b><br /><br />At 7:30 am on July 1, 1916, the first Allied soldiers climbed out of their trenches along the Somme River in France and charged out into no-man's-land toward the barbed wire and machine guns at the German front lines. <br /><br />By the end of this first day of the Allied attack, the British army alone would lose 20,000 men; in the coming months, the fifteen-mile-long territory along the river would erupt into the epicenter of the Great War. The Somme would mark a turning point in both the war and military history, as soldiers saw the first appearance of tanks on the battlefield, the emergence of the air war as a devastating and decisive factor in battle, and more than one million casualties (among them a young Adolf Hitler, who took a fragment in the leg). In just 138 days, 310,000 men died.<br /><br />In this vivid, deeply researched account of one history's most destructive battles, historian Martin Gilbert tracks the Battle of the Somme through the experiences of footsoldiers (known to the British as the PBI, for Poor Bloody Infantry), generals, and everyone in between. Interwoven with photographs, journal entries, original maps, and documents from every stage and level of planning, <i>The Somme</i> is the most authoritative and affecting account of this bloody turning point in the Great War.<br /><br />",

    "description": "In the span of five violent hours on August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina destroyed major Gulf Coast cities and flattened 150 miles of coastline. Yet those wind-torn hours represented only the first stage of the relentless triple tragedy that Katrina brought to the entire Gulf Coast, from Louisiana to Mississippi to Alabama.<br /><br />First came the hurricane, one of the three strongest ever to make landfall in the United States -- 150-mile-per-hour winds, with gusts measuring more than 180 miles per hour ripping buildings to pieces.<br /><br />Second, the storm-surge flooding, which submerged a half million homes, creating the largest domestic refugee crisis since the Civil War. Eighty percent of New Orleans was under water, as debris and sewage coursed through the streets, and whole towns in south-eastern Louisiana ceased to exist.<br /><br />And third, the human tragedy of government mis-management, which proved as cruel as the natural disaster itself. Ray Nagin, the mayor of New Orleans, implemented an evacuation plan that favored the rich and healthy. Kathleen Blanco, governor of Louisiana, dithered in the most important aspect of her job: providing leadership in a time of fear and confusion. Michael C. Brown, the FEMA director, seemed more concerned with his sartorial splendor than the specter of death and horror that was taking New Orleans into its grip.<br /><br />In <em>The Great Deluge</em>, bestselling author Douglas Brinkley, a New Orleans resident and professor of history at Tulane University, rips the story of Katrina apart and relates what the Category 3 hurricane was like from every point of view. The book finds the true heroes -- such as Coast Guard officer Jimmy Duckworth and hurricane jock Tony Zumbado.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Brinkley lets the Katrina survivors tell their own stories, masterly allowing them to record the nightmare that was Katrina. <em>The Great Deluge</em> investigates the failure of government at every level and breaks important new stories. Packed with interviews and original research, it traces the character flaws, inexperience, and ulterior motives that allowed the Katrina disaster to devastate the Gulf Coast.",

Looking back not only at his own much younger self, but also at the other writers who shared Paris with him - James Joyce, Wyndham Lewis, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald - he recalls the time when, poor, happy and writing in cafes, he discovered his vocation. Written during the last years of Hemingway's life, his memoir is a lively and powerful reflection of his genius that scintillates with the romance of the city.",

    "description": "Edith Wharton made the world of Old New York her own, the wealthy high society so powerfully depicted in these three elegantly ironic novels. Revolving around the marriage question, they explore the dilemma of women and men held within the rigid bounds of social convention. Thus in The House of Mirth, the novel that first brought Edith Wharton to fame, the complex, poignant heroine Lily Bart must either break away and find a more meaningful existence, or become a part of the superficial values of the nouveaux riches; in The Custom of the Country, the energetic and ambitious Undine Spragg works her way to wealth anti power through a succession of marriages; while Newland Archer in The Age of Innocence is caught in an agony of indecision: whether he should choose the duty of a socially approved marriage, or the love of a woman frowned upon by 'decent' society.",

    "description": "\"Thirty years ago my older brother, who was ten years old at the time, was trying to get a report on birds written that he'd had three months to write. [It] was due the next day. We were out at our family cabin in Bolinas, and he was at the kitchen table close to tears, surrounded by binder paper and pencils and unopened books on birds, immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead. Then my father sat down beside him, put his arm around my brother's shoulder, and said. 'Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.'\"<p>With this basic instruction always in mind, Anne Lamott returns to offer us a new gift: a step-by-step guide on how to write and on how to manage the writer's life. From \"Getting Started,' with \"Short Assignments,\" through \"Shitty First Drafts,\" \"Character,\" \"Plot,\" \"Dialogue.\" all the way from \"False Starts\" to \"How Do You Know When You're Done?\" Lamott encourages, instructs, and inspires. She discusses \"Writers Block,\" \"Writing Groups,\" and \"Publication.\" Bracingly honest, she is also one of the funniest people alive.</p><p>If you have ever wondered what it takes to be a writer, what it means to be a writer, what the contents of your school lunches said about what your parents were really like, this book is for you. From faith, love, and grace to pain, jealousy, and fear, Lamott insists that you keep your eyes open, and then shows you how to survive. And always, from the life of the artist she turns to the art of life.</p>",

    "description": "From the bestselling author of <b>Slaves of New York</b> comes a hilarious, clear-eyed, satiric novel about the sad plight of a misguided woman on the make in Manhattan. Thirty-two-year-old Florence Collins is an \"aging filly-about-town\"--still beautiful enough to be (sometimes) invited to the best parties and the right restaurants, but unmarried and rapidly going broke. In her world, marriage to a wealthy man is all that can save her, although Florence's hard-hearted search for security and status takes her on an inevitable downward spiral.<br /><br />New York \"society novels\" at the turn of the nineteenth century gave us a piercing look at the world and rituals of the city's wealthy; Janowitz here casts that tradition in a fresh light, giving us a tirn-of-the-century society novel that demonstrates how little seems to have changed. In a sly and unforgettable portrait of New York's <i>haute monde</i>, Janowitz brilliantly evokes a young woman's struggle for love and survival in the city that is as unforgiving today as it was a hundred years ago.",

    "description": "Her curiosity began as a teenager, with an awareness of her body and the reaction other people had to it. It continued with the realization that women\u2019s bodies often gave them a strange power over men. As an adult, it became a fascination with professional sex workers, leading to a plunge into their world. <i>Bare</i> follows the author and her fellow dancers through Seattle strip clubs and bachelor parties, exploring in riveting detail Eaves\u2019s own motivations and behavior, as well as those of her coworkers, as they make their way through the sometimes exhilarating, often disturbing world of stripping. This compelling, revealing memoir exposes the reader to that world behind the flashing lights and offers illuminating insights into the reasons women take up this work\u2014and how it affects their identities and lives off the job.<br />In its unstinting honesty, <i>Bare</i> demands that we take a closer look at the way sexuality is viewed in our culture; what, if anything, constitutes \"normal\" desire; the ethics of swapping money\u2014or anything else\u2014for sex; and how women and men navigate the perilous contradictions and double standards that make up today\u2019s socio-sexual conversation.",

    "description": "<b>From the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Hallelujah Anyway</i> and <i>Help, Thanks, Wow</i>, a spiritual antidote to anxiety and despair in increasingly fraught times.</b><br /><br />As Anne Lamott knows, the world is a dangerous place. Terrorism and war have become the new normal. Environmental devastation looms even closer. And there are personal demands on her faith as well: getting older; her mother's Alzheimer's; her son's adolescence; and the passing of friends and time.<br /><br />Fortunately for those of us who are anxious about the state of the world, whose parents are also aging and dying, whose children are growing harder to recognize as they become teenagers, <i>Plan B</i> offers hope that we\u2019re not alone in the midst of despair. It shares with us Lamott's ability to comfort and to make us laugh despite the grim realities.<br /><br />Anne Lamott is one of our most beloved writers, and <i>Plan B</i> is a book more necessary now than ever. It is further evidence that, as <i>The New Yorker</i> has written, \"Anne Lamott is a cause for celebration.\"",

    "description": "When Harvard medical student Alexa Albert conducted a public-health study as the Mustang Ranch brothel in Nevada, the only state in the union where prostitution is legal, neither she nor the brothel could have predicted the end result. Having worked with homeless prostitutes in Times Square, Albert was intimate with human devastation cause by the sex trade, and curious to see if Nevada\u2019s brothels offered a less harmful model for a business that will always be with us. The Mustang Ranch has never before given an outsider such access, but fear of AIDS was hurting the business, and the Ranch was eager to get publicity for its rigorous standards of sexual hygiene. Albert was drawn into the lives of the women of the Mustang Ranch, and what began as a public-health project evolved into something more intimate and ambitious, a six-year study of the brothel ecosystem, its lessons and significance. <br /><br />The women of the Mustang Ranch poured their stories out to Albert: how they came to be there, their surprisingly deep sense of craft and vocation, how they reconciled their profession with life on the outside. Dr. Albert went as far into this world as it is possible to go \u2014 some will say too far \u2014 including sitting in on sessions with customers, and the result is a book that puts an unforgettable face on America\u2019s maligned and caricatured subculture.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

What he discovers is unimaginable: a deadly vendetta against the Catholic Church by a centuries-old underground organization--- the Illuminati. Desperate to save the Vatican from a powerful time bomb, Langdon joins forces in Rome with the beautiful and mysterious scientist Vittoria Vetra. Together they embark on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and the most secretive vault on the earth... the long-forgotten Illuminati lair.",

    "description": "<b>From world-renowned scientist Jane Goodall, as seen in the new National Geographic documentary <i>Jane</i>, comes a provocative look into the ways we can positively impact the world by changing our eating habits. </b><br /><br /><b>\"One of those rare, truly great books that can change the world.\" - John Robbins, author of <i>The Food Revolution</i></b><br /><br />The renowned scientist who fundamentally changed the way we view primates and our relationship with the animal kingdom now turns her attention to an incredibly important and deeply personal issue-taking a stand for a more sustainable world. In this provocative and encouraging book, Jane Goodall sounds a clarion call to Western society, urging us to take a hard look at the food we produce and consume-and showing us how easy it is to create positive change.Offering her hopeful, but stirring vision, Goodall argues convincingly that each individual can make a difference. She offers simple strategies each of us can employ to foster a sustainable society. <br /><br />Brilliant, empowering, and irrepressibly optimistic, HARVEST FOR HOPE is one of the most crucial works of our age. If we follow Goodall's sound advice, we just might save ourselves before it's too late.",

    "description": "\"The most powerful challenge to be mounted against the principles of popular environmentalism in the last fifteen years.\"--The Washington Post Book World (on the first edition)Arguing that the ultimate resource is the human imagination coupled to the human spirit, Julian Simon has led a vigorous challenge to conventional beliefs about scarcity of energy and natural resources, pollution of the environment, the effects of immigration, and the \"perils of overpopulation.\" The comprehensive data, careful quantitative research, and economic logic contained in the first edition of The Ultimate Resource questioned widely held professional judgments about the threat of overpopulation, and Simon's celebrated bet with Paul Ehrlich about resource prices in the 1980s enhanced the public attention--both pro and con--that greeted this controversial book.Now Princeton University Press presents a revised and expanded edition of The Ultimate Resource. The new volume is thoroughly updated and provides a concise theory for the observed trends: Population growth and increased income put pressure on supplies of resources. This increases prices, which provides opportunity and incentive for innovation. Eventually the innovative responses are so successful that prices end up below what they were before the shortages occurred. The book also tackles timely issues such as the supposed rate of species extinction, the \"vanishing farmland crisis, \" and the wastefulness of coercive recycling.In Simon's view, the key factor in natural and world economic growth is our capacity for the creation of new ideas and contributions to knowledge. The more people alive who can be trained to help solve the problems that confrontus, the faster we can remove obstacles, and the greater the economic inheritance we shall bequeath to our descendants. In conjunction with the size of the educated population, the key constraint on human progress is the nature of the economic-political system: talented people need economic freedom and security to bring their talents to fruition.",

    "description": "The setting is Atlanta, Georgia \u2014 a racially mixed, late-century boomtown full of fresh wealth and wily politicians. The protagonist is Charles Croker, once a college football star, now a late-middle-aged Atlanta conglomerate king whose outsize ego has at last hit up against reality. Charlie has a 29,000 acre quail-shooting plantation, a young and demanding second wife, and a half-empty office complex with a staggering load of debt.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Conrad Hensley, idealistic young father of two, is laid off from his job at the Croker Global Foods warehouse near Oakland and finds himself spiraling into the lower depths of the American legal system.<br /><br />And back in Atlanta, when star Georgia Tech running back Fareek \u201cthe Canon\u201d Fanon, a homegrown product of the city\u2019s slums, is accused of date-raping the daughter of a pillar of the white establishment, upscale black lawyer Roger White II is asked to represent Fanon and help keep the city\u2019s delicate racial balance from blowing sky-high.<br /><br />Networks of illegal Asian immigrants crisscrossing the continent, daily life behind bars, shady real estate syndicates \u2014 Wolfe shows us contemporary America with all the verve, wit, and insight that have made him our most admired novelist. Charlie Croker\u2019s deliverance from his tribulations provides an unforgettable denouement to the most widely awaited, hilarious and telling novel America has seen in ages \u2014 Tom Wolfe\u2019s most outstanding achievement to date.",

    "description": "Tom Wolfe, the master social novelist of our time, the spot-on chronicler of all things contemporary and cultural, presents a sensational new novel about life, love, and learning--or the lack of it--amid today's American colleges.<br /><br />Our story unfolds at fictional Dupont University: those Olympian halls of scholarship housing the cream of America's youth, the roseate Gothic spires and manicured lawns suffused with tradition . . . Or so it appears to beautiful, brilliant Charlotte Simmons, a sheltered freshman from North Carolina. But Charlotte soon learns, to her mounting dismay, that for the upper-crust coeds of Dupont, sex, cool, and kegs trump academic achievement every time.<br /><br />As Charlotte encounters the paragons of Dupont's privileged elite--her roommate, Beverly, a Groton-educated Brahmin in lusty pursuit of lacrosse players; Jojo Johanssen, the only white starting player on Dupont's godlike basketball team, whose position is threatened by a hotshot black freshman from the projects; the Young Turk of Saint Ray fraternity, Hoyt Thorpe, whose heady sense of entitlement and social domination is clinched by his accidental brawl with a bodyguard for the governor of California; and Adam Geller, one of the Millennial Mutants who run the university's \"independent\" newspaper and who consider themselves the last bastion of intellectual endeavor on the sex-crazed, jock-obsessed campus--she is seduced by the heady glamour of acceptance, betraying both her values and upbringing before she grasps the power of being different--and the exotic allure of her own innocence.<br /><br />With his trademark satirical wit and famously sharp eye for telling detail, Wolfe's I Am Charlotte Simmons draws on extensive observations at campuses across the country to immortalize the early-21st-century college-going experience.",

    "description": "With 101 \"Life\" magazine covers to his credit, Philippe Halsman (1906-1979) was one of the leading portrait photographers of his time. In addition to his distinguished career in photojournalism, Halsman was one of the great pioneers of experimental photography, motivated by a profound desire to push this youngest of art forms toward new frontiers by using innovative and unorthodox photographic techniques. <br />One of Halsman's favorite subjects was Salvarod Dali, the glittering and controversial painter and theorist with whom the photographer shared a unique friendship and extraordinary professional collaboration that spanned over thirty years. Whenever Dali imagined a photograph so strange that its production seemed impossible, Halsman tried to find the solution, and invariably succeeded. <br />As Halsman explains in his postface, \"Dali's Mustache\" is the fruit of this marriage of the minds. The jointly conceived and seemingly nonsensical questions and answers reveal the gleeful humor and assumed cynicism for which Dali is famous, while the marvelous and inspired images of Dali's mustache brilliantly display Halsman's consummate skill and extraordinary inventiveness as a photographer. <br />This combination of wit, absurdity, and the offhandedly profound is irresistible and has contributed to the enduring fascination inspired by this unique photographic interview, which has become a cult classic and valuable collector's item since its original publication in 1954. The present volume faithfully reproduces the first edition and will introduce a new generation to the irreverent humor and imaginative genius of two great artists.<br />",

    "description": "Available for the first time, the full-length, unexpurgated version of the essay that incited one of the most passionate literary controversies ever in American letters . . .<br /><br />When the Atlantic Monthly first published an excerpted version of B.R. Myers' polemic\u2014in which he attacked literary giants such as Don Delillo, Annie Proulx, and Cormac McCarthy, quoting their work extensively to accuse them of mindless pretension\u2014it caused a world-wide sensation.<br /><br />\"A welcome contrarian takes on the state of contemporary American literary prose,\" said a Wall Street Journal review. \"Useful mischief,\" said Jonathan Yardley in The Washington Post. \"Brilliantly written,\" declared The Times of London.<br /><br />But Myers' expanded version of the essay does more than just attack sanctified literary heavyweights.It also:<br /><br />* Examines the literary hierarchy that perpetuates the status quo by looking at the reviews that the novelists in question received. It also considers the literary award system. \"Rick Moody received an O. Henry Award in 1997,\" Myers observes, \"whereupon he was made an O. Henry juror himself. And so it goes.\"<br />* Showcases Myers' biting sense of wit, as in the new section, \"Ten Rules for 'Serious' Writers,\" and his discussion of the sex scenes in the bestselling books of David Guterson (\"If Jackie Collins had written that,\" Myers says after one example, \"reviewers would have had a field day.\")<br />* Champions clear writing and storytelling in a wide range of writers, from \"pop\" novelists such as Stephen King to more \"serious\" literary heavyweights such as Somerset Maugham. Myers also considers the classics such as Balzac and Henry James, and recommends numerous other undeservedly obscure authors.<br />* Includes an all-new section in which Myers not only considers the controversy that followed the Atlantic essay, but responds to several of his most prominent critics.<br /><br />Published on the one-year anniversary of original Atlantic Monthly essay, the new, expanded A READER'S MANIFESTO continues B.R. Myers' fight on behalf of the American reader, arguing against pretension in so-called \"literary\" fiction, naming names and brilliantly exposing the literary status quo.",

    "description": "This is Goethe's first novel, published in 1774. Written in diary form, it tells the tale of an unhappy, passionate young man hopelessly in love with Charlotte, the wife of a friend - a man who he alternately admires and detests. 'The Sorrows of Young Werther' became an important part of the 'Sturm und Drang movement, and greatly influenced later 'Romanticism'. The work is semi-autobiographical - in 1772, two years before the novel was published, Goethe had passed through a similar tempestuous period, when he lost his heart to Charlotte Buff, who was at that time engaged to his friend Johann Christian Kestner.",

    "description": "On July 4, 1845, Henry David Thoreau moved into the cabin he had built on the shore of Walden Pond, thus beginning the most famous experiment in simple living in American history. On the 150th anniversary of that event, Houghton Mifflin, successor to Thoreau's original publisher, is proud to publish a new edition of Walden, annotated by the distinguished Thoreau scholar Walter Harding and illustrated with Thoreau's own drawings. Even those who have read Walden many times will find much that is new in this edition, and those reading the book for the first time will discover why it has changed the lives of generations of readers.",

One father (Robert's real father) was a highly educated man but fiscally poor. The other father was the father of Robert's best friend - that Dad was an eighth-grade drop-out who became a self-made multi-millionaire. The lifelong monetary problems experienced by his poor dad pounded home the counterpoint communicated by his rich dad. Taking that message to heart, Kiyosaki was able to retire at 47.",

    "description": "Thousands of people live in the subway, railroad, and sewage tunnels that form the bowels of New York City. This book is about them, the so-called \"mole people\" living alone and in communities, in the frescoed waiting rooms of long-forgotten subway tunnels and in pick-axed compartments below busway platforms. It is about how and why people move underground, who they are, and what they have to say about their lives and the treacherous \"topside\" world they've left behind. There are even the voices of young children taken down to the tunnels by parents who are determined to keep their families together, although as one tunnel dweller explains, \"once you go down there, you can't be a child anymore.\" Though they maintain an existence hidden from the world aboveground, tunnel dwellers form a large and growing sector of the homeless population. They are a diverse group, and they choose to live underground for many reasonssome rejecting society and its values, others reaffirming those values in what they view as purer terms, and still others seeking shelter from the harsh conditions on the streets. Their enemies include government agencies and homeless organizations as well as wandering crack addicts and marauding gangs. In communities underground, however, many homeless people find not only a place but also an identity. On these pages Jennifer Toth visits underground New York with various straight-talking guides, from outreach workers and transit police to vetern tunnel dwellers, graffiti artists, and even the \"mayor\" of a large, highly structured community several levels down. In addition to chilling and poignant firsthand accounts of tunnel life, she describes the fascinating and labryrinthine physical world beneath the city and discusses the literary allusions and historical points of view that prejudice our culture against those who \"go underground\". Toth has gained unprecedented access to a strange and frightening world, but The Mole People is not a daredevil jo",

    "description": "Love, like falling rain, can revive an arid life. But how can we find the love that brings true pleasure? How can we avoid the tragic love, with its lessons of sacrifice and loss, so deeply embedded in our culture? 'Pleasure is a sensation. It is written into our bodies; it is an experience of delight, of joy'In this inspiring book, Carol Gilligan sets out to create a radical new map of love. Although old patriarchal structures have been challenged the underlying patterns remain: the channeling of boys into 'masculinity'; the anxiety of girls in adolescence, the silences between men and women, the split between our social and our inner voice. In her work with children, adolescents and couples in crisis, Gilligan came to see how this 'double consciousness' - already present in the violence and betrayal of ancient myths, like that of Oedipus - had developed over thousands of years. Hunting for a counter myth, she discovered the story of Psyche and Cupid, a haunting tale of love and the searching soul, a model of resistance which she uses to frame her quest, showing how joy can be discovered in the heart of pain. The Birth of Pleasure rings with the voices of girls and boys, mothers and fathers, lovers and couples and echoes with telling readings of familiar writers, from Greek tragedy to Anne Frank, from Shakespeare to Proust, from Freud to Toni Morrison. All of us will find something that we recognise - and with luck, this brilliant, compassionate, flame-like book could really change our lives.",

    "description": "This book started a revolution. Published decades ago, it made women's voices heard, in their own right, with their own integrity, for virtually the 1st time in social scientific theorizing about women. Its impact was immediate &amp; continues in the academic world &amp; beyond. Translated into 16 languages, with over 750,000 copies sold. <i>In a Different Voice</i> has inspired new research, new educational initiatives &amp; political debate--&amp; helped many women &amp; men to see themselves &amp; each other in a different light. Gilligan believes that psychology has persistently &amp; systematically misunderstood women: their motives, their moral commitments, the course of their psychological growth &amp; their special view of what is important in life. Here she sets out to correct psychology's misperceptions &amp; refocus its view of female personality. The result is a <i>tour de force</i>, which may reshape much of what psychology now has to say about female experience.<br />Acknowledgments<br />Introduction<br />Woman's place in man's life cycle<br />Images of relationship <br />Concepts of self &amp; morality<br />Crisis &amp; transition <br />Women's rights &amp; women's judgment<br />Visions of maturity<br />References<br />Index of Study Participants<br />General Index",

    "description": "\"The [Bush] administration has squandered the opportunity to eliminate al Qaeda....A new al Qaeda has emerged and is growing stronger, in part because of our own actions and inactions. It is in many ways a tougher opponent than the original threat we faced before September 11, and we are not doing what is necessary to make America safe from that threat.\" <p> No one has more authority to make that claim than Richard Clarke, the former counterterrorism czar for both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The one person who knows more about Usama bin Laden and al Qaeda than anyone else in this country, he has devoted two decades of his professional life to combating terrorism. Richard Clarke served seven presidents and worked inside the White House for George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush until he resigned in March 2003. He knows, better than anyone, the hidden successes and failures of the Clinton years. He knows, better than anyone, why we failed to prevent 9/11. He knows, better than anyone, how President Bush reacted to the attack and what happened behind the scenes in the days that followed. He knows whether or not Iraq presented a terrorist threat to the United States and whether there were hidden costs to the invasion of that country. </p><p> Most disturbing of all are Clarke's revelations about the Bush administration's lack of interest in al Qaeda prior to September 11. From the moment the Bush team took office and decided to retain Clarke in his post as the counterterrorism czar, Clarke tried to persuade them to take al Qaeda as seriously as had Bill Clinton. For months, he was denied the opportunity even to make his case to Bush. He encountered key officials who gave the impression that they had never heard of al Qaeda; who focused incessantly on Iraq; who even advocated long-discredited conspiracy theories about Saddam's involvement in previous attacks on the United States. </p><p> Clarke was the nation's crisis manager on 9/11, running the Situation Room -- a scene described here for the first time -- and then watched in dismay at what followed. After ignoring existing plans to attack al Qaeda when he first took office, George Bush made disastrous decisions when he finally did pay attention. Coming from a man known as one of the hard-liners against terrorists, <i>Against All Enemies</i> is both a powerful history of our two-decades-long confrontation with terrorism and a searing indictment of the current administration.</p>",

    "description": "Cry, the Beloved Country, the most famous and important novel in South Africa\u2019s history, was an immediate worldwide bestseller in 1948. Alan Paton\u2019s impassioned novel about a black man\u2019s country under white man\u2019s law is a work of searing beauty.<br /><br /><i>Cry, the beloved country, for the unborn child that is the inheritor of our fear. Let him not love the earth too deeply. Let him not laugh too gladly when the water runs through his fingers, nor stand too silent when the setting sun makes red the veld with fire. Let him not be too moved when the birds of his land are singing, nor give too much of his heart to a mountain or valley. For fear will rob him of all if he gives too much.</i><br /><br /><i></i>The eminent literary critic Lewis Gannett wrote, \u201cWe have had many novels from statesmen and reformers, almost all bad; many novels from poets, almost all thin. In Alan Paton\u2019s <i>Cry, the Beloved Country</i> the statesman, the poet and the novelist meet in a unique harmony.\u201d <br /><br /><i>Cry, the Beloved Country</i> is the deeply moving story of the Zulu pastor Stephen Kumalo and his son, Absalom, set against the background of a land and a people riven by racial injustice. Remarkable for its lyricism, unforgettable for character and incident, <i>Cry, the Beloved Country</i> is a classic work of love and hope, courage and endurance, born of the dignity of man.",

    "description": "Imagine earthy Tolkienesque characters in a setting full of cemeteries, graverobbers, necromancers, corpse-eaters--even a huge labyrinthine necropolis. Imagine mephitic gardens where the sarcophage, selenotrope, and necrophilium bloom. Then throw in star-crossed lovers, crazed zealots, stalwart heroes, bloodthirsty renegade armies, hideous monsters, and likeable misfits. You've got just a hint of the wondrous and original visions in the dark fantasy world of Brian McNaughton. <p> Horror scholar S. T. Joshi, in the afterword to this collection of stories, notes the strong influence of Clark Ashton Smith, Lord Dunsany, H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, and Greco-Roman decadent works such as Petronius's <i>Satyricon</i>. \"McNaughton seems to have mastered one of the most difficult of literary arts: to draw upon the classics of the field without losing his own voice.... The world that McNaughton has created in this book is the world of the ghoul; and who knows but that <i>The Throne of Bones</i> will become the standard textbook for the care and feeding of ghouls just as <i>Dracula</i> has become that for vampires?\"<br /><br />Contents:<br />Ringard and Dendra (1996)<br />The Throne of Bones (1997)<br />The Vendren Worm (1990)<br />Meryphillia (1990)<br />Reunion in Cephalune (1997)<br />The Art of Tiphytsorn Glocque (1997)<br />A Scholar from Sythiphore (1995)<br />Vendriel and Vendreela (1988)<br />The Retrograde Necromancer (1993)<br />The Return of Liron Wolfbaiter (1997)</p>",

But he is foiled at the last moment and falls into the hands of ruthless and inventive torturers. They devise for him an ingenious and diplomatic death but, for once, they bungle the job and he escapes.

I can feel them . . . this is the voice we're going to be hearing for a long time.\"--Harlan Ellison </b><br /><br />In an old car rocking down a North Carolina highway with the radio on so loud you can't hear the music. . . Behind a dusty Georgia carny show. . . In a mausoleum in Baton Rouge, or in an alley in Calcutta. . . Here wanderers come to rest, the lost and lonely press their bodies up against each other, the heat rises, flesh yields, bones are bared, blood spills. This is the landscape of today's most brilliant young horror writer, Poppy Z. Brite.<br /><br />Now, in a collection that sings like cutting edge rock 'n' roll and shows the deft touch of a master storyteller, Poppy Z. Brite weaves her unique spell of the sensual, the frightening, and the forbidden. . .<br /><br /><b>\"Every page of Brite's work stresses the beautiful and heartbreaking strangeness of the world.\"--<i>Fangoria</i> </b>",

The bodies pile up like dirty laundry: sex-obsessed tramps used as playthings by some unspeakable creature. Straker is determined to solve the rash of rape and mutilation murders with trimmings that beggar description. Reporter Melinda Pierce will do anything to find out, by offering herself up in order to infiltrate the arcane and lust-drenched warrens of backstage wrestling. This human juggernaut, this masked rack of guts, muscle, and mayhem... Is Goon just a wrestler gone insane? Or is he something hideously worse? \"A raunchy riot of wraslin', ringrats, and no-holds-barred-sex. A must for hardcore fans of over-the-top action, and outrageous thrills.\" -Lucy Taylor. Seven Pages of Artwork by noted artist Micah Hayes. Original Cover Art by Erik Wilson. Our edition completely re-typeset and the author's preferred edition.",

Robert Durling's translation brings a new power and accuracy to the rendering of Dante's extraordinary vision of Hell, with its terror, pathos, and sardonic humour, and its penetrating analyses of the psychology of sin and the ills that plague society. <br />A newly edited version of the Italian text is on facing pages, and this edition includes fully comprehensive notes as well as sixteen essays on special subjects.<br />",

            "description": "The fictional Multiverse, which consists of several universes, many layered dimensions, spheres, and alternative worlds, is the place where the eternal struggle between Law and Chaos, the two main forces of Moorcock's worlds, takes place. In all these dimensions and worlds, these forces constantly war for supremacy. Since the victory of Law or Chaos would cause the Multiverse either to become permanently static or totally formless, the Cosmic Balance enforces certain limits which the powers of Law and Chaos violate at their peril. Law, Chaos, and the Balance are active, but seemingly non-sentient, forces which empower various champions and representatives.\n    \n    The Eternal Champion, a Hero who exists in all dimensions, times and worlds, is the one who is chosen by fate to fight for the Cosmic Balance; however, he often does not know of his role, or, even worse, he struggles against it, never to succeed. Since his role is to intervene when either Law or Chaos have gained an excess of power, he is always doomed to be surrounded by strife and destruction, although he may go through long periods of relative quiet.\n    \n    All the incarnations of the Eternal Champion are facets of each other, and the Champion may also be aided by a companion, who, like himself, exists in various incarnations. Likewise the Champion is often associated with a romantic interest that is possibly an aspect of an eternal figure. Other characters in the various books have occasionally crossed over from one universe to another, although it is unclear what their status in the multiverse may be. Normally, the incarnations of the Champion do not interact and are treated as a series of serial incarnations for facets of a single consciousness, but various cataclysmic events (such as the end of a Cycle of Cycles of the multiverse's progression, or an invasion by hostile entities from an entirely separate multiverse) may bring them together in various ways. This is very dangerous (it causes strains on the fabric of the multiverse as well as mental issues for the Champion), but amplifies the Champion's power enormously.\n    \n    In every aspect, the Champion is a warrior almost without peer: when he wields some version of his usual weapon, the Black Sword (known by various names such as Stormbringer or Kanajana, although not all versions of the Sword are the same and some are active entities in their own right) few can stand against him. He is also usually an adept, if often unwilling, leader of fighters and has strategic and tactical abilities.

    "description": "In <b>The Beauty Myth</b> the fearless Naomi Wolf revolutionized the way we think about beauty. In <b>Misconceptions</b>, she demythologizes motherhood and reveals the dangers of common assumptions about childbirth. With uncompromising honesty she describes how hormones eroded her sense of independence, ultrasounds tested her commitment to abortion rights, and the keepers of the OB/GYN establishment lacked compassion. The weeks after her first daughter\u2019s birth taught her how society, employers, and even husbands can manipulate new mothers. She had bewildering post partum depression, but learned that a surprisingly high percentage of women experience it. <br />Wolf\u2019s courageous willingness to talk about the unexpected difficulties of childbirth will help every woman become a more knowledgeable planner of her pregnancy and better prepare her for the challenges of balancing a career, freedom, and a growing family. Invaluable in its advice to parents, <b>Misconceptions</b> speaks to anyone connected\u2013personally, medically, or professionally\u2013to a new mother.",

Ten years later, Billy, age thirty, returns from an extended stay at St Vitus' Hospital for the Mentally Ill to discover a world full of unimaginable strangeness: office buildings vanish without reason, small animals turn up without their heads, and cruel villains ride city buses to complete their evil schemes.\" <p>Lost within this unwelcoming place, Billy finds the companionship of two lonely children, Effie and Gus Mumford - one a science fair genius, the other a charming, silent bully. With a nearly forgotten bravery, Billy confronts the monotony of his job in telephone sales, the awkward beauty of a desperate pickpocket named Penny Maple, and the seemingly impossible solution to the mystery of his sister's death. Along the path laden with hidden clues and codes that dare to be deciphered, the boy detective may learn the greatest secret of all: the necessity of the unknown.</p>",

On the brink of twenty, Charles High-way preps desultorily for Oxford, cheerfully loathes his father, and meticulously plots the seduction of a girl named Rachel -- a girl who sorely tests the mettle of his cynicism when he finds himself falling in love with her.",

The story of Sackville-West's marriage to Harold Nicolson is one of intrigue and bewilderment. In <i>Portrait of a Marriage</i>, their son Nigel combines his mother's memoir with his own explanations and what he learned from their many letters. Even during her various love affairs with women, Vita maintained a loving marriage with Harold. <i>Portrait of a Marriage</i> presents an often misunderstood but always fascinating couple.",

    "description": "During one month in the autumn of election year 2000, scores of movie-business strivers are focused on one goal: getting a piece of an elusive, but surely huge, television saga, the one that opens with Huns sweeping through Mongolia and closes with a Mormon diviner in the Las Vegas desert; the sure-to-please-everyone multigenerational TV miniseries about diviners, those miracle workers who bring water to perpetually thirsty (and hungry and love-starved) humankind. Among the wannabes: Vanessa Meandro, hot-tempered head of Means of Production, an indie film company; her harried and varied staff; a Sikh cab driver, promoted to the office of -theory and practice of TV; a bipolar bicycle messenger, who makes a fateful mis-delivery; two celebrity publicists, the Vanderbilt girls; a thriller writer who gives Botox parties; the daughter of an L.A. big-shot, who is hired to fetch Vanessa+s Krispy Kremes and more; a word man who coined the phrase--inspired by a true story; and a supreme court justice who wants to write the script.A few true artists surface in the course of Moody+s rollicking but intricately woven novel, and real emotion eventually blossoms for most of Vanessa's staff at Means of Production, even herself. THE DIVINERS is a cautionary tale about pointless ambition; a richly detailed look at the interlocking worlds of money, politics, addiction, sex, work, and family in modern America; and a masterpiece of comedy that will bring Rick Moody to a still higher level of appreciation.",

En Emilio se encuentra la concentraci\u00f3n o s\u00edntesis de sus ideas educativas. Podemos decir que en casi todos sus libros y folletos retoma, con mayor o menor \u00e9nfasis, dicha cuesti\u00f3n. Emilio o de la educaci\u00f3n ha orientado gran parte de la pedagog\u00eda moderna. Pocas obras tienen la riqueza conceptual que \u00e9sta. Los educadores contempor\u00e1neos a\u00fan tienen mucho que aprender de Rousseau.",

    "description": "In the decade since it won the Booker Prize, Ben Okri's <b>Famished Road</b> has become a classic. Like Salman Rushdie's <i>Midnight's Children</i> or Gabriel Garcia Marquez's <b>One Hundred Years of Solitude</b>, it combines brilliant narrative technique with a fresh vision to create an essential work of world literature.<br /><br />The narrator, Azaro, is an <i>abiku</i>, a spirit child, who in the Yoruba tradition of Nigeria exists between life and death. The life he foresees for himself and the tale he tells is full of sadness and tragedy, but inexplicably he is born with a smile on his face. Nearly called back to the land of the dead, he is resurrected. But in their efforts to save their child, Azaro's loving parents are made destitute. The tension between the land of the living, with its violence and political struggles, and the temptations of the carefree kingdom of the spirits propels this latter-day Lazarus's story.",

Haunting and hypnotic, these five novels by Ana\u00efs Nin began in 1946 to appear in quiet succession. Though published separately over the next fifteen years, the five were conceived as a continuous experience\u2014a continuous novel like Proust's, real and flowing as a river. <br /><br />The full impact of Ana\u00efs Nin's genius is only to be found through reading the novels in context and in succession. They form a rich, luminous tapestry whose overall theme Nin has called \u201cwoman at war with herself.\u201d Characters, symbols appear and reappear: now one, now another unfolding, gradually revealing, changing, struggling, growing, and Nin had forged an evocative language all her own for the telling.<br /><br />\u201cThe diary taught me that there were no neat ends to novels, no neat denouement, no neat synthesis,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo I began an endless novel, a novel in which the climaxes consisted of discoveries in awareness, each step in awareness becoming a stage in the growth like the layers in trees.\u201d<br /><br /><i>Cities of the Interior</i> fulfills a long\u2013time desire on the part of readers, publisher, and Ana\u00efs Nin herself to reunite the five novels in a single volume.",

This combined volume was first published, by the author, in 1959. Its central figures are three women resembling different aspects of the author, and in some superficial ways June Miller. In some of the books they interact with each other, with a painter resembling Henry Miller and with South Americans resembling Gonzalo Mor\u00e9 and Helba. Most of the content is taken from her diaries, polished and thinly disguised. It was followed by her last novel Collages.",

    "description": "Considered by many to be her masterpiece, Edith Wharton's second full-length work is a scathing yet personal examination of the exploits and follies of the modern upper class. As she unfolds the story of Undine Spragg, from New York to Europe, Wharton affords us a detailed glimpse of what might be called the interior d\u00e9cor of this America and its nouveau riche fringes. Through a heroine who is as vain, spoiled, and selfish as she is irresistibly fascinating, and through a most intricate and satisfying plot that follows Undine's marriages and affairs, she conveys a vision of social behavior that is both supremely informed and supremely disenchanted. <i>- Anita Brookner</i>",

    "description": "<b>The only English translation authorized by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn </b><br /><br />First published in the Soviet journal <i>Novy Mir</i> in 1962, <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i> stands as a classic of contemporary literature. The story of labor-camp inmate Ivan Denisovich Shukhov, it graphically describes his struggle to maintain his dignity in the face of communist oppression. An unforgettable portrait of the entire world of Stalin's forced work camps, <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i> is one of the most extraordinary literary documents to have emerged from the Soviet Union and confirms Solzhenitsyn's stature as \"a literary genius whose talent matches that of Dosotevsky, Turgenev, Tolstoy\"--Harrison Salisbury<br /><br />This unexpurgated 1991 translation by H. T. Willetts is the only authorized edition available and fully captures the power and beauty of the original Russian.",

    "description": "Alternate Cover Edition ISBN 0141180145 (ISBN13: 9780141180144)<br /><br />Surely, no stranger work exists in the annals of protest literature than <i>The Master and Margarita</i>. Written during the Soviet crackdown of the 1930s, when Mikhail Bulgakov's works were effectively banned, it wraps its anti-Stalinist message in a complex allegory of good and evil. Or would that be the other way around? The book's chief character is Satan, who appears in the guise of a foreigner and self-proclaimed black magician named Woland. Accompanied by a talking black tomcat and a \"translator\" wearing a jockey's cap and cracked pince-nez, Woland wreaks havoc throughout literary Moscow. First, he predicts that the head of noted editor Berlioz will be cut off; when it is, he appropriates Berlioz's apartment. (A puzzled relative receives the following telegram: \"Have just been run over by streetcar at Patriarch's Ponds funeral Friday three afternoon come Berlioz.\") Woland and his minions transport one bureaucrat to Yalta, make another one disappear entirely except for his suit, and frighten several others so badly that they end up in a psychiatric hospital. In fact, it seems half of Moscow shows up in the bin, demanding to be placed in a locked cell for protection. <p> Meanwhile, a few doors down in the hospital lives the true object of Woland's visit: the author of an unpublished novel about Pontius Pilate. This Master \u2014 as he calls himself \u2014 has been driven mad by rejection, broken not only by editors' harsh criticism of his novel but, Bulgakov suggests, by political persecution as well. Yet Pilate's story becomes a kind of parallel narrative, appearing in different forms throughout Bulgakov's novel: as a manuscript read by the Master's indefatigable love, Margarita, as a scene dreamed by the poet \u2014 and fellow lunatic \u2014 Ivan Homeless, and even as a story told by Woland himself. Since we see this narrative from so many different points of view, who is truly its author? Given that the Master's novel and this one end the same way, are they in fact the same book? These are only a few of the many questions Bulgakov provokes, in a novel that reads like a set of infinitely nested Russian dolls: inside one narrative there is another, and then another, and yet another. His devil is not only entertaining, he is <i>necessary</i>: \"What would your good be doing if there were no evil, and what would the earth look like if shadows disappeared from it?\"</p><p> Unsurprisingly \u2014 in view of its frequent, scarcely disguised references to interrogation and terror \u2014 Bulgakov's master work was not published until 1967, almost three decades after his death. Yet one wonders if the world was really ready for this book in the late 1930s, if, indeed, we are ready for it now. Shocking, touching, and scathingly funny, it is a novel like no other. Woland may re-attach heads or produce 10-ruble notes from the air, but Bulgakov proves to be the true magician here. <i>The Master and Margarita</i> is a different book each time it is opened. <i>\u2014 Mary Park</i></p>",

    "description": "The Book of Dede Korkut is a collection of twelve stories set in the heroic age of the Oghuz Turks, a nomadic tribe who had journeyed westwards through Central Asia from the ninth century onwards. The stories are peopled by characters as bizarre as they are unforgettable: Crazy Karchar, whose unpredictability requires an army of fleas to manage it; Kazan, who cheerfully pretends to necrophilia in order to escape from prison; the monster Goggle-eye; and the heroine Chichek, who shoots, races on horseback and wrestles her lover. Geoffrey Lewis's classic translation retains the odd and oddly appealing style of the stories, with their mixture of the colloquial, the poetic and the dignified, and magnificently conveys the way in which they bring to life a wild society and its inhabitants. This edition also includes an introduction, a map and explanatory notes.",

Galsworthy went on to write more books about the Forsyte family.  These subsequent books, however, were published as elements of two other series, named \"A Modern Comedy\" and \"The End of the Chapter\".

Now she has married a man she adores who is from a prominent New England family, and she is about to give birth to their first child. But what should be the happiest day of her life becomes the day her world falls apart. Her daughter is born beautiful and healthy, but no one can help noticing the African American traits in her appearance. Dana's husband, to her great shock and dismay, begins to worry that people will think Dana has had an affair.<br />The only way to repair the damage done is for Dana to track down the father she never knew and to explore the possibility of African American lineage in his family history. Dana's determination to discover the truth becomes a poignant journey back through her past and her husband's heritage that unearths secrets rooted in prejudice and fear.<br />Barbara Delinsky's \"Family Tree\" is an utterly unforgettable novel that asks penetrating questions about race, family, and the choices people make in times of crisis--choices that have profound consequences that can last for generations.",

    "description": "Ariana Costas may be a college professor in Vermont, but she's still a Jersey girl at heart-at least according to her lovable, eccentric Greek family. Then her twin sister, Zoe disappears and her Jersey roots tug hard. Soon Ari is back home, ducking bullets and, to her chagrin, getting rescued by a hunk in a black leather jacket. Detective Quinn Donovan takes one look at the windblown beauty-and then looks again. If this lady isn't Zoe Costas, it's someone who looks exactly like her. Suddenly, Ari's in trouble deeper than the Atlantic at high tide, and Quinn is trying to protect her without spilling his well-guarded secrets ... as deja vu just might become the love affair of a lifetime.",

    "description": "Aimee Bender\u2019s stunning debut collection, <b>The Girl in the Flammable Skirt</b><i>,</i> proved her to be one of the freshest voices in American fiction. Now, in her first novel, she builds on that early promise.<br /><br />Mona Gray was ten when her father contracted a mysterious illness and she became a quitter, abandoning each of her talents just as pleasure became intense. The only thing she can\u2019t stop doing is math: She knocks on wood, adds her steps, and multiplies people in the park against one another. When Mona begins teaching math to second-graders, she finds a ready audience. But the difficult and wonderful facts of life keep intruding. She finds herself drawn to the new science teacher, who has an unnerving way of seeing through her intricately built fa\u00e7ade. Bender brilliantly directs her characters, giving them unexpected emotional depth and setting them in a calamitous world, both fancifully surreal and startlingly familiar.",

Blessed with an ego the size of Mount Everest and virtually no sense of self, he blusters through life with cheerful obliviousness. <em>Who Moved My BlackBerry?</em> is the uproarious e-epistolary story of one spectacularly bad year in his life, during which Martin hires an executive coach to help him achieve \"22.5 percent better than my bestest,\" only to inadvertently insult his new boss, watch his wife get a job that threatens to eclipse his own, and allow his BlackBerry--complete with racy e-mails to his secretary/lover--to fall into the hands of his juvenile delinquent son. This novel is set in an office so dysfunctional, it's bound to strike a chord with any nine-to-fiver. Comic schadenfreude at its best!",

Taste, hearing, and smell. Amid the flavors of Mexico\u2019s fiery chilies and spices, a couple on holiday discovers dark truths about the maturing of desire in the title story, \u201cUnder the Jaguar Sun.\u201d In \u201cA King Listens,\u201d a gripping portrait of a frenzied mind, the menacing echoes in a huge palace spur a tyrant\u2019s thoughts to the heights of paranoid intensity. \u201cThe Name, the Nose\u201d drives to a startling conclusion as men across time and space pursue the women whose aromas have enchanted them. Mordant and deliciously offbeat, this trio of tales is a treat from a master of short fiction.<br /><br /> \u201c[Calvino is] a learned, daring, ingeniously gifted magus . . . <i>Under the Jaguar Sun . . . </i>fuses fable with neuron . . . The reader is likely to salivate.\u201d \u2014 Cynthia Ozick, <i>New York Times Book Review</i>",

    "description": "The time is the 1950s. The place is a blue-collar town in upstate New York, where five high school girls are joined in a gang dedicated to pride, power, and vengeance on a world they never made - a world that seems made to denigrate and destroy them. Foxfire is Joyce Carol Oates' strongest and most unsparing novel yet...an often engrossing, often shocking evocation of female rage, gallantry, and grit. Here, then, are the Foxfire chronicles - the secret history of a sisterhood of blood, a haven from a world of lechers and oppressors, marked by a liberating fury that burns too hot to last. It is the story of Maddy Monkey, who writes it...of Goldie, whose womanly body masks a fierce, explosive temper...of Lana, with her Marilyn Monroe hair and packs of Chesterfields...of timid Rita, whose humiliation leads to the first act of Foxfire revenge. Above all, it is the story of Legs Sadovsky, with her lean, on-the-edge, icy beauty, whose nerve, muscle, hate, and hurt make her the spark of Foxfire, its guiding spirit, its burning core. At once brutal and lyrical, this is a careening joyride of a novel - charged with outlaw energy and lit by intense emotion. The story moves over the years from the first eruption of adolescent anger at sexual abuse to a shared life financed by luring predatory men into traps baited with sex. But then the gang's very success leads to disaster - as Foxfire makes a last tragic stand against a society intent on swallowing it up. Yet amid scenes of violence, sexual abuse, exploitation, and vengeance lies this novel's greatest power: the exquisite, astonishing rendering of the bonds that link the girls of Foxfire together - especially that between Maddy, the teller ofthe tale, and Legs, whose quintessential strength and bedrock bravery make her one of the most vivid and vital heroines in modern fiction.",

    "description": "<i>A Breath of Snow and Ashes</i> continues the extraordinary story of 18th-century Scotsman Jamie Fraser and his 20th-century wife, Claire.<br /><br />The year is 1772, and on the eve of the American Revolution, the long fuse of rebellion has already been lit. Men lie dead in the streets of Boston, and in the backwoods of North Carolina, isolated cabins burn in the forest.<br /><br />With chaos brewing, the governor calls upon Jamie Fraser to unite the backcountry and safeguard the colony for King and Crown. But from his wife Jamie knows that three years hence the shot heard round the world will be fired, and the result will be independence \u2014 with those loyal to the King either dead or in exile. And there is also the matter of a tiny clipping from The Wilmington Gazette, dated 1776, which reports Jamie\u2019s death, along with his kin. For once, he hopes, his time-traveling family may be wrong about the future.",

Two decades before, she had traveled back in time and into the arms of a gallant eighteenth-century Scot named Jamie Fraser. Then she returned to her own century to bear his child, believing him dead in the tragic battle of Culloden. Yet his memory has never lessened its hold on her... and her body still cries out for him in her dreams.</p><p>Then Claire discovers that Jamie survived. Torn between returning to him and staying with their daughter in her own era, Claire must choose her destiny. And as time and space come full circle, she must find the courage to face the passion and pain awaiting her...the deadly intrigues raging in a divided Scotland... and the daring voyage into the dark unknown that can reunite or forever doom her timeless love.</p>",

But now she is returning with her grown daughter to Scotland's majestic mist-shrouded hills. Here Claire plans to reveal a truth as stunning as the events that gave it birth: about the mystery of an ancient circle of standing stones ...about a love that transcends the boundaries of time ...and about James Fraser, a Scottish warrior whose gallantry once drew a young Claire from the security of her century to the dangers of his ....<br /><br />Now a legacy of blood and desire will test her beautiful copper-haired daughter, Brianna, as Claire's spellbinding journey of self-discovery continues in the intrigue-ridden Paris court of Charles Stuart ...in a race to thwart a doomed Highlands uprising ...and in a desperate fight to save both the child and the man she loves....",

    "description": "Why would a cow lick a tractor? Why are collies getting dumber? Why do dolphins sometimes kill for fun? How can a parrot learn to spell? How did wolves teach man to evolve? <br /><br />Temple Grandin draws upon a long, distinguished career as an animal scientist and her own experiences with autism to deliver an extraordinary message about how animals act, think, and feel. She has a perspective like that of no other expert in the field, which allows her to offer unparalleled observations and groundbreaking ideas.<br /><br />People with autism can often think the way animals think, putting them in the perfect position to translate \"animal talk.\" Grandin is a faithful guide into their world, exploring animal pain, fear, aggression, love, friendship, communication, learning, and, yes, even animal genius. The sweep of Animals in Translation is immense and will forever change the way we think about animals.<br /><br /><br />*includes a Behavior and Training Troubleshooting Guide<br /><b></b>\u00a0<br /><b>Among its provocative ideas, the book:</b><br /><br /><br />~argues that language is not a requirement for consciousness--and that animals do have consciousness.<br /><br />~applies the autism theory of \"hyper-specificity\" to animals, showing that animals and autistic people are so sensitive to detail that they \"can't see the forest for the trees\"--a talent as well as a \"deficit\".<br /><br />~explores the \"interpreter\" in the normal human brain that filters out detail, leaving people blind to much of the reality that surrounds them--a reality animals and autistic people see, sometimes all too clearly.<br /><br />~explains how animals have \"superhuman\" skills: animals have animal genius.<br /><br />~compares animals to autistic savants, declaring that animals may in fact be autistic savants, with special forms of genius that normal people do not possess and sometimes cannot even see.<br /><br />~examines how humans and animals use their emotions to think, to decide, and even to predict the future.<br /><br />~reveals the remarkable abilities of handicapped people and animals\u00a0.<br /><br />~maintains that the single worst thing you can do to an animal is to make it feel afraid.",

She also lectures widely on autism\u2014because Temple Grandin is autistic, a woman who thinks, feels, and experiences the world in ways that are incomprehensible to the rest of us. <br /><br />In this unprecedented book, Grandin delivers a report from the country of autism. Writing from the dual perspectives of a scientist and an autistic person, she tells us how that country is experienced by its inhabitants and how she managed to breach its boundaries to function in the outside world. What emerges in <i>Thinking in Pictures </i>is the document of an extraordinary human being, one who, in gracefully and lucidly bridging the gulf between her condition and our own, sheds light on the riddle of our common identity.",

    "description": "He's one of America's most recognizable and acclaimed actors-a star on Broadway, an Oscar nominee for The Aviator, and the only person to ever win Emmys for acting, writing, and directing, during his eleven years on M*A*S*H. Now Alan Alda has written a memoir as elegant, funny, and affecting as his greatest performances.<br /><br />\"My mother didn't try to stab my father until I was six,\" begins Alda's irresistible story. The son of a popular actor and a loving but mentally ill mother, he spent his early childhood backstage in the erotic and comic world of burlesque and went on, after early struggles, to achieve extraordinary success in his profession.<br /><br />Yet <b>Never Have Your Dog Stuffed </b>is not a memoir of show-business ups and downs. It is a moving and funny story of a boy growing into a man who then realizes he has only just begun to grow.<br /><br />It is the story of turning points in Alda's life, events that would make him what he is-if only he could survive them.<br /><br />From the moment as a boy when his dead dog is returned from the taxidermist's shop with a hideous expression on his face, and he learns that death can't be undone, to the decades-long effort to find compassion for the mother he lived with but never knew, to his acceptance of his father, both personally and professionally, Alda learns the hard way that change, uncertainty, and transformation are what life is made of, and true happiness is found in embracing them.<br /><br /><b>Never Have Your Dog Stuffed</b>, filled with curiosity about nature, good humor, and honesty, is the crowning achievement of an actor, author, and director, but surprisingly, it is the story of a life more filled with turbulence and laughter than any Alda has ever played on the stage or screen.<b>\n  <br /></b>",

Worldwide, there are eight million copies in print in fifty different languages. This is Chinua Achebe's masterpiece and it is often compared to the great Greek tragedies, and currently sells more than one hundred thousand copies a year in the United States.<br /><br />A simple story of a \"strong man\" whose life is dominated by fear and anger, Things Fall Apart is written with remarkable economy and subtle irony. Uniquely and richly African, at the same time it reveals Achebe's keen awareness of the human qualities common to men of all times and places.<br />(back cover)",

    "description": "On a chilly February day, two old friends meet in the throng outside a London crematorium to pay their last respects to Molly Lane. Both Clive Linley and Vernon Halliday had been Molly's lovers in the days before they reached their current eminence: Clive is Britain's most successful modern composer, and Vernon is editor of the newspaper <i>The Judge.</i> Gorgeous, feisty Molly had other lovers, too, notably Julian Garmony, Foreign Secretary, a notorious right-winger tipped to be the next prime minister.<br /><br />In the days that follow Molly's funeral, Clive and Vernon will make a pact with consequences that neither could have foreseen. Each will make a disastrous moral decision, their friendship will be tested to its limits, and Julian Garmony will be fighting for his political life. A sharp contemporary morality tale, cleverly disguised as a comic novel, <b>Amsterdam</b> is \"as sheerly enjoyable a book as one is likely to pick up this year\" (<i>The Washington Post Book World</i>).",

Le Devin is shaped somewhat like a sleeping woman. At her head is the village of Les Salants, while its more prosperous rival, La Houssiniere, lies at her feet. Yet even though you can walk from one to the other in an hour, they are worlds apart. And now Mado is back in Les Salants hoping to reconcile with her estranged father. But what she doesn't realize is that it is not only her father whose trust she must regain.",

    "description": "Like her well-received 1999 novel, Chocolat, Harris's latest outing unfolds around the arrival of an outsider in a tiny French town. This time wine replaces chocolate as Harris's magic elixir, and the newcomer to the village of Lansquenet sur Tannes is Jay Mackintosh, a 37-year-old has-been writer from London. Fourteen years have passed since Jay's debut novel, Jackapple Joe, won the Prix Goncourt. Since then, he has been churning out B-novels under a pseudonym; he currently lives with his girlfriend, Kerry, an aggressively successful 25-year-old celebrity journalist. Flashbacks reveal that Jay's only recollections of happiness are the golden summers he spent as a youth with old Joseph \"Jackapple Joe\" Cox in the small English town of Kirby Monckton. Joe, a colorful character who made wines from fruits and berries, inspired Joe's successful first novel. But one day he disappeared. When Jay stumbles across an advertisement for an 18th-century \"chateau\" in wine-growing country, the spell of his misery is broken. After downing a bottle of Joe's '75 Special, which he has been hoarding for 24 years, Jay decides to buy the house sight unseen. Leaving Kerry in London, Jay moves to Lansquenet and starts a new rural life, beginning to write under his own name again. He is bewildered by his reclusive neighbor, Marise d'Api, who apparently coveted his derelict house and land, and is ostracized by the townspeople. Jay's quest to discover why everyone, including Marise's former mother-in-law, blames Marise for her husband's suicide keeps the plot moving at a steady clip. Despite some unbelievable twists and a slightly uneven paceAit begins slowly, but by the last quarter races aheadAthis is an entertaining narrative, equal parts whimsy and drama.",

And soon Framboise will realize that the journal also contains the key to the tragedy that indelibly marked that summer of her ninth year. . . .",

A gripping who-done-it journey back in time, it begins with Masters meeting a drunken Stuart lying on a sidewalk in Cambridge, England, and leads through layers of hell\u2026back through crimes and misdemeanors, prison and homelessness, suicide attempts, violence, drugs, juvenile halls and special schools\u2013to expose the smiling, gregarious thirteen-year-old boy who was Stuart before his long, sprawling, dangerous fall. <br /><br />Shocking, inspiring, and hilarious by turns, <b>Stuart: A Life Backwards</b> is a writer\u2019s quest to give voice to a man who, beneath his forbidding exterior, has a message for us all: that every life\u2013even the most chaotic and disreputable\u2013is a story worthy of being told.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "Praise for <i>Agile Estimating and Planning</i> \"Traditional, deterministic approaches to planning and estimating simply don't cut it on the slippery slopes of today's dynamic, change-driven projects. Mike Cohn's breakthrough book gives us not only the philosophy, but also the guidelines and a proven set of tools that we need to succeed in planning, estimating, and scheduling projects with a high uncertainty factor. At the same time, the author never loses sight of the need to deliver business value to the customer each step of the way.\"<br /><br />--Doug DeCarlo, author of <i>eXtreme Project Management: Using Leadership, Principles and Tools to Deliver Value in the Face of Volatility</i> (Jossey-Bass, 2004)<br /><br />\"We know how to build predictive plans and manage them. But building plans that only estimate the future and then embrace change, challenge most of our training and skills. In <i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning</b> </i>, Mike Cohn once again fills a hole in the Agile practices, this time by showing us a workable approach to Agile estimating and planning. Mike delves into the nooks and crannies of the subject and anticipates many of the questions and nuances of this topic. Students of Agile processes will recognize that this book is truly about agility, bridging many of the practices between Scrum and ExtremeProgramming.\"<br /><br />--Ken Schwaber, Scrum evangelist, Agile Alliance cofounder, and signatory to the Agile Manifesto<br /><br />\"In <b> <i>Agile Estimating and Planning</i> </b>, Mike Cohn has, for the first time, brought together most everything that the Agile community has learned about the subject. The book is clear, well organized, and a pleasant and valuable read. It goes into all the necessary detail, and at the same time keeps the reader's burden low. We can dig in as deeply as we need to, without too much detail before we need it. The book really brings together everything we have learned about Agile estimation and planning over the past decade. It will serve its readers well.\"<br /><br />--Ron Jeffries, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.XProgramming.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.XProgramming.com</a>, author of <i>Extreme Programming Installed </i>(Addison-Wesley, 2001) and <i>Extreme Programming Adventures in C#</i> (Microsoft Press, 2004)<br /><br />\"<i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning</b> </i> provides a view of planning that's balanced between theory and practice, and it is supported by enough concrete experiences to lend it credibility. I particularly like the quote 'planning is a quest for value.' It points to a new, more positive attitude toward planning that goes beyond the 'necessary evil' view that I sometimes hold.\"<br /><br />--Kent Beck, author of <i>Extreme Programming Explained, Second Edition</i> (Addison-Wesley, 2005)<br /><br />\"Up-front planning is still the most critical part of software development. Agile software development requires Agile planning techniques. This book shows you how to employ Agile planning in a succinct, practical, and easy-to-follow manner.\"<br /><br />--Adam Rogers, Ultimate Software<br /><br />\"Mike does a great follow-up to <i>User Stories Applied </i>by continuing to provide Agile teams with the practical approaches and techniques to increase agility. In this book, Mike provides time-proven and well-tested methods for being successful with the multiple levels of planning and estimating required by Agile. This book is the first to detail the disciplines of Agile estimating and planning, in ways that rival my 1980 civil engineering texts on CPM Planning and Estimating.\"<br /><br />--Ryan Martens, President and Founder, Rally Software Development Corporation<br /><br />\"With insight and clarity, Mike Cohn shows how to effectively produce software of high business value. With Agile estimation and planning, you focus effort where it really counts, and continue to do so as circumstances change.\"<br /><br />--Rick Mugridge, Rimu Research Ltd., and lead author, <i>Fit for Developing Software</i> (Prentice Hall, 2005)<br /><br />\"Finally! The groundbreaking book my clients have been clamoring for! <i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning</b> </i> demystifies the process of defining, driving, and delivering great software that matters to the business. Mike's clarity, insight, and experience leap out through every page of this book, offering an approach that is relevant and immediately useful to all members of an Agile project.\"<br /><br />--Kert D. Peterson, President, Enterprise Agile Group, LLC<br /><br />\"This isn't yet another generic book on Agile software development. <b> <i>Agile Estimating and Planning</i> </b> fills a gap left by most of the other books and gives you important, practical, down-to-earth techniques needed to be successful on Agile development projects.\"<br /><br />--Steve Tockey, Principal Consultant, Construx Software<br /><br />\"Estimation, planning, and tracking is a trinity. If you don't do one of them, you don't need the other two. This book provides very practical knowledge for estimation, planning, prioritizing, and tracking. It should be compulsory subject matter for project managers and their teams, even if they hesitate to call themselves Agile.\"<br /><br />--Niels Malotaux, Project Coach<br /><br />\"Effective planning is an important, but often misunderstood, part of any successful Agile project. With <i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning</b> </i>, Mike Cohn has given us a definitive guide to a wide range of Agile estimating and planning practices. With his clear and practical style, Mike not only explains how to successfully get started planning an Agile project, but also provides a wealth of tips and advice for improving any team's Agile planning process. This book is a must-read for managers, coaches, and members of Agile teams.\"<br /><br />--Paul Hodgetts, Agile coach and CEO, Agile Logic<br /><br />\"Mike's writing style captures the essence of agility-just the right amount of information to bring clarity to the reader. This book provides an excellent guide for all Agile practitioners, both seasoned and novice.\"<br /><br />--Robert Holler, President and CEO, VersionOne, LLC<br /><br />\"It is as if Mike took the distilled knowledge regarding planning and estimation of a great Agile developer (which he is) and laid out all he knows in an easily understandable manner. More importantly, he has a great mix of concepts with real-world examples finished off with a case study so the reader can relate the information to their own situation. Unless you are already an expert Agile planner and estimator, this book is for you.\"<br /><br />--Alan Shalloway, CEO, Senior Consultant, Net Objectives, and coauthor of <i>Design Patterns Explained, Second Edition</i> (Addison-Wesley, 2005)<br /><br />\"Although I had plenty of XP experience before trying out Mike Cohn's Agile planning practices, the effectiveness of the practical and proven techniques in this book blew me away! The book recognizes that people, not tools or processes, produce great software, and that teams benefit most by learning about their project and their product as they go. The examples in the book are concrete, easily grasped, and simply reek of common sense. This book will help teams (whether Agile or not) deliver more value, more often, and have fun doing it! Whether you're a manager or a programmer, a tester or a CEO, part of an Agile team, or just looking for a way to stamp out chaos and death marches, this book will guide you.\"<br /><br />--Lisa Crispin, coauthor of <i>Testing Extreme Programming</i> (Addison-Wesley, 2003)<br /><br />\"Mike Cohn does an excellent job demonstrating how an Agile approach can address issues of risk and uncertainty in order to provide more meaningful estimates and plans for software projects.\"<br /><br />--Todd Little, Senior Development Manager, Landmark Graphics<br /><br />\"Mike Cohn explains his approach to Agile planning, and shows how 'critical chain' thinking can be used to effectively buffer both schedule and features. As with <i>User Stories Applied</i>, this book is easy to read and grounded in real-world experience.\"<br /><br />--Bill Wake, author of <i>Refactoring Workbook</i> (Addison-Wesley, 2003)<br /><br />\"Mike brings this book to life with real-world examples that help reveal how and why an Agile approach works for planning software development projects. This book has great breadth, ranging from the fundamentals of release planning to advanced topics such as financial aspects of prioritization. I can see this book becoming an invaluable aid to Agile project managers, as it provides a wealth of practical tips such as how to set iteration length and boot-strap velocity, and communicate progress.\"<br /><br />--Rachel Davies, Independent Consultant<br /><br />\"There has been a need for a solid, pragmatic book on the long-term vision of an Agile Project for project managers. <i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning</b> </i> addresses this need. It's not theory--this book contains project-tested practices that have been used on Agile projects. As Mike's test subjects, we applied these practices to the development of video games (one of the most unpredictable project environments you can imagine) with success.\"<br /><br />--Clinton Keith, Chief Technical Officer, High Moon Studios<br /><br />\"When I first heard Mike Cohn speak, I was impressed by a rare combination of qualities: deep experience and understanding in modern iterative and Agile methods; a drive to find and validate easy, high-impact solutions beyond the status quo of traditional (usually ineffective) methods; and the passion and clarity of a natural coach. These qualities are evident in this wonderful, practical guide. I estimate you won't be disappointed in studying and applying his advice.\"<br /><br />--Craig Larman, Chief Scientist, Valtech, and author of <i>Applying UML and Patterns, Third Edition</i> (Prentice Hall, 2005) and <i>Agile and Iterative Development</i> (Addison-Wesley, 2004)<br /><br />\"<i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning</b> </i> is a critical guide on how to successfully provide value to customers of IT services. This book is filled with clear examples that are essential--from project team members to the executive level.\"<br /><br />--Lou Thomas, Director, Applications Development, Farm Credit Services of America<br /><br />\"This work is deeply significant in that it articulates and details structured techniques to realize a simple, but profound insight--planning is an iterative quest for value, rather than a perfunctory scheduling of activities. Mike presents processes to converge on this value while reducing risk and uncertainty, supporting decision making, establishing trust, and conveying information. Agile methodologies have shifted the emphasis from plans to planning, but have glossed over many of the finer details of Agile planning. Now, very simply and accessibly, Mike demonstrates how it can be done.\"<br /><br />--Sanjiv Augustine, Practice Director, Lean-Agile Consulting at CC Pace, and author of <i>Managing Agile Projects</i> (Prentice Hall, 2005)<br /><br />\"The techniques described in <i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning</b> </i> have helped us tremendously with planning and managing our projects. It provides all you have ever wanted to know about Agile project management.\"<br /><br />--Roman Pichler, Engineering Manager, Siemens Communications<br /><br />\"Mike Cohn presents a highly pragmatic and logical approach to making projects successful in a world beset by uncertainty and change. With his trademark clarity and directness, Mike cuts through the management mumbo jumbo to present practical techniques that can be put into use immediately. Put the odds squarely in your favor by making Mike Cohn the planning guru on your next big project.\"<br /><br />--Pete Deemer, Vice President, Product Development, Yahoo!<br /><br />\"This book distills the fundamental ideas behind Agile estimating and planning, presenting them in a thoughtful and approachable manner. This is a 'must-have' book that presents clear, unambiguous, and practical advice for anyone who wants to successfully manage modern software development projects.\"<br /><br />--Scott W. Ambler, President, Ambysoft Inc.<br /><br />\"How do your projects go? Frustrating changes? Uncertainty? Product missing both the mark and the deadline? With insight and clarity, Mike Cohn shows how to effectively produce software that is of high business value. With agile estimation and planning, you focus effort where it really counts, and continue to do so as circumstances change.\"<br /><br />--Rick Mugridge, Rimu Research Ltd., and lead author of <i>Fit for Developing Software</i><br /><br />\"We are true believers in the agile methods described in this book, and have experienced a substantially positive impact from their implementation and continued use. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in making their software development more practical and effective.\"<br /><br />--Mark M. Gutrich, President and CEO, Fast 401k, Inc.<br /><br />Detailed, Proven Techniques for Estimating and Planning Any Agile Project <i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning </b> </i>is the definitive, practical guide to estimating and planning agile projects. In this book, Agile Alliance cofounder Mike Cohn discusses the philosophy of agile estimating and planning and shows you exactly how to get the job done, with real-world examples and case studies.<br /><br />Concepts are clearly illustrated and readers are guided, step by step, toward how to answer the following questions: What will we build? How big will it be? When must it be done? How much can I really complete by then? You will first learn what makes a good plan-and then what makes it agile.<br /><br />Using the techniques in <i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning</b> </i>, you can stay agile from start to finish, saving time, conserving resources, and accomplishing more. Highlights include:<br /><br /><br />Why conventional prescriptive planning fails and why agile planning works<br />How to estimate feature size using story points and ideal days--and when to use each<br />How and when to re-estimate<br />How to prioritize features using both financial and nonfinancial approaches<br />How to split large features into smaller, more manageable ones<br />How to plan iterations and predict your team's initial rate of progress<br />How to schedule projects that have unusually high uncertainty or schedule-related risk<br />How to estimate projects that will be worked on by multiple teams <i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning</b> </i> supports any agile, semiagile, or iterative process, including Scrum, XP, Feature-Driven Development, Crystal, Adaptive Software Development, DSDM, Unified Process, and many more. It will be an indispensable resource for every development manager, team leader, and team member.",

    "description": "From Dave Eggers: For this year\u2019s edition of The Best American Nonrequired Reading, we wanted to expand the scope of the book to include shorter pieces, and fragments of stories, and transcripts, screenplays, television scripts -- lots of things that we hadn\u2019t included before. Our publisher readily agreed, and so you\u2019ll see that this year\u2019s edition is far more eclectic in form than previous editions. Along the way to making the book, we also came across a variety of things that didn\u2019t fit neatly anywhere, but which we felt should be included, so we conceived the front section, which is a loose Best American roundup of notable words and sentences from 2005. It is, like this book in general, obviously and completely incomplete, but might be interesting nevertheless.",

    "description": "\"Sweet and Low\" is the amazing, bittersweet, hilarious story of an American family and its patriarch, a short-order cook named Ben Eisenstadt who, in the years after World War II, invented the sugar packet and Sweet'N Low, converting his Brooklyn cafeteria into a factory and amassing the great fortune that would destroy his family. It is also the story of immigrants to the New World, sugar, saccharine, obesity, and the health and diet craze, played out across countries and generations but also within the life of a single family, as the fortune and the factory passed from generation to generation. The author, Rich Cohen, a grandson (disinherited, and thus set free, along with his mother and siblings), has sought the truth of this rancorous, colorful history, mining thousands of pages of court documents accumulated in the long and sometimes corrupt life of the factor, and conducting interviews with members of his extended family. Along the way, the forty-year family battle over the fortune moves into its titanic phase, with the money and legacy up for grabs. \"Sweet and Low \"is the story of this struggle, a strange comic farce of machinations and double dealings, and of an extraordinary family and its fight for the American dream. Rich Cohen is the author of \"Tough Jews,\" \"The Avenger\"s, and \"Machers and Rockers,\" and the memoir \"Lake Effect.\" His work has appeared in \"The New Yorker\" and \"Vanity Fair,\" among many other publications, and he is a contributing editor to \"Rolling Stone.\" He lives in New York City. A \"New York Times\" Notable Book of the YearA \"Chicago Tribune\" Best Book of the Year\"\" \"Sweet and Low\" is the story of an American family and its patriarch, a short-order cook named Ben Eisenstadt who, in the years after World War II, invented the sugar packet and Sweet'N Low, converting his Brooklyn cafeteria into a factory and amassing the great fortune that would destroy his family. It is also the story of immigrants to the New World, sugar, saccharine, obesity, and the health and diet craze, played out across countries and generations but also within the life of a single family, as the fortune and the factory passed from generation to generation. The author, Rich Cohen, a grandson (disinherited, and thus set free, along with his mother and siblings), has sought the truth of this rancorous, colorful history, mining thousands of pages of court documents accumulated in the long and sometimes corrupt life of the factor, and conducting interviews with members of his extended family. Along the way, the forty-year family battle over the fortune moves into its titanic phase, with the money and legacy up for grabs. \"Sweet and Low \"is the story of this struggle, a strange comic farce of machinations and double dealings, and of an extraordinary family and its fight for the American dream.\"A rollicking, utterly compelling family saga that is part detective story, part morality tale, part tragedy and part farce. It is a story peopled with eccentrics and naifs and scoundrels, and a story recounted with uncommon acuity and wit . . . Mr. Cohen . . . writes about his family with a mixture of affection, outrage and bafflement, startled and often in awe at the strangeness of his relatives and the bizarre trajectory of their lives . . . He has not settled for writing a simple, straight-ahead memoir, however. Instead, he's intercut the story with tart and highly entertaining asides about everything from the history of Brooklyn to the history of the sugar business, from the legacy of the immigrant experience to the big business of diets and weight loss . . . [Cohen has] managed to turn his family's rancorous history into a gripping memoir: a small classic of familial triumph, travail and strife, and a telling--and often hilarious--parable about the pursuit and costs of the American Dream.\"--Michiko Kakutani, \"The New York Times\"\"\" \"Do not disinherit a man who makes his living with a pen. He may exact revenge by splashing the family's boils and foibles in black-and white on the pages of a spectacularly entertaining book. That is the misfortune of the family of the late Benjamin Eisenstadt, self-made scion behind those ubiquitous pink packages of fake sugar piled in bowls on restaurant tabletops the world over. But it's a riotous reading experience for the rest of us, who get to enjoy Rich Cohen's roiling, boisterous, hysterical and weirdly scholarly remembrance of his messy, badly behaved Jewish clan in \"Sweet and Low.\"\"--Michael Ollove, \"The Baltimore Sun\"\" \"\"\" \"How decadent . . . to indulge in Rich Cohen's rollicking acount of his family and the business it built, a book that aims mostly to settle old scores, air dirty laundry and answer decades of petty insults from relatives . . . He paints vividly, and not flatteringly . . . [Cohen] has a terrific eye for detail, the little things that affix people and places in our memories, the gestures and miscues that shape family history . . . Reading him savage his family, you sometimes wonder, is he allowed to do this? It's a guilty pleasure--sort of like sugar without the calories.\"--Kate Zernike, \"\"The New York Times Book Review\"\" \"A wildly addictive, high-octane narrative. Cohen sashays with boisterous panache from the history of the sugar trade to grandmother Betty's brooch . . . Cohen moves from journalistic objectivity to the intensely personal with ease, enjoying the kind of access that historians almost never get . . . Is Rich Cohen, the grandson who got squat from the Sweet'N Low millions, taking revenge? No; this book is about his mother, and the way that her family--the whole saccharine-sticky lot of them--were truly and unnaturally awful to her, a woman who makes but brief appearances in the narrative and is never eulogized. A woman who could have survived her vile relatives only through a tremendous inner strength. It is this strength which, subtly, gloriously, Rich Cohen celebrates.\"--John Barlowe, \"\"Washington Post\"\" \"The rollicking saga of Grandpa Ben's business, 'taken over and stripmined by hooligans.' The battle overt his vast family fortune leads to feuds between siblings, corruption, lawsuits and the ultimate disintegration of the clan. It is Cohen's good fortune to be on the side of the family that was disinherited. Sweet revenge is the energy behind this glorious book.\"--Andrea Sachs, \"Time\" \"Alternately delicious and sour . . . All these characters are portrayed with elegantly phrased detail, along with Cohen's insightful eye for the larger picture. \"Sweet and Low\" might as well be a Balzacian 19th-century novel complete with a crisis, a contested will and a tragic resolution . . . \"Sweet and Low\" is never less than fascinating reading, both for what it says and what it doesn't. Hell hath no fury like a writer deprived.\"--Melvin Bukiet, \"\"Los Angeles Times Book Review\"\" \"\"Sweet and Low\" is a wondrous evocation of an era and character types that won't be seen again.\"--Ron Grossman, \"Chicago\"\" Tribune\" \"The book is not just about settling scores . . . Mr. Cohen aims higher, writing not only about his family but also about the first Jewish settlers in N",

Then Cam swoops in and gives her a sparkling engagement ring, making her decision even more impossible. Husband vs. career. Vera Wang wedding dress vs. sexy first-date outfits.

Whenever she falls asleep in one, she wakes up in the other. She's got the best of both worlds and what more could a girl ask for? Right?</p>",

    "description": "Milkman Dead was born shortly after a neighborhood eccentric hurled himself off a rooftop in a vain attempt at flight. For the rest of his life he, too, will be trying to fly. With this brilliantly imagined novel, Toni Morrison transfigures the coming-of-age story as audaciously as Saul Bellow or Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. As she follows Milkman from his rustbelt city to the place of his family\u2019s origins, Morrison introduces an entire cast of strivers and seeresses, liars and assassins, the inhabitants of a fully realized black world.",

But on the other side, things seem different. Milo visits the island of Conclusions (you get there by jumping), learns about time from a ticking watchdog named Tock, and goes up against the dastardly Discord and Dynne. By the time Milo and Tock set off toward the Mountains of Ignorance to rescue the twin Princesses Rhyme and Reason, Milo realizes something astonishing. Life is far from dull. In fact, it's exciting beyond his wildest dreams...",

    "description": "An ideal starting-point for those interested in Buddhism, <i>Being Peace</i> contains Thich Nhat Hanh's teachings on peace and meditation. Using real examples from his own life, as well as poems and fables, Nhat Hanh explains his key practices for living \"right in the moment we are alive.\" These lessons are taught with fine writing and sparkling phrases that draw the reader in and make <i>Being Peace</i> a book that encourages multiple readings, both alone and in groups.<br />This new edition of Nhat Hanh's seminal bestseller marks the book's first update since it was released in 1987. It includes a new introduction by noted Buddhist Jack Kornfield and beautiful illustrations by internationally recognized artist Mayumi Oda. Still as timely as when it was first published over 15 years ago, <i>Being Peace</i> is a revelation for anyone concerned with the state of the world and the quality of life.",

Today\u2019s independent, self-sufficient lobstermen belong to the communities imbued with a European sense of ties between land and people, but threatened by the forces of homogenization spreading up the eastern seaboard.In the tradition of William Warner\u2019s <i>Beautiful Swimmers</i>, veteran journalist Colin Woodard (author of\u00a0<i>American Character: A History of the Epic Struggle Between Individual Liberty and the Common Good</i>) traces the history of the rugged fishing communities that dot the coast of Maine and the prized crustacean that has long provided their livelihood. Through forgotten wars and rebellions, and with a deep tradition of resistance to interference by people \u201cfrom away,\u201d Maine\u2019s lobstermen have defended an earlier vision of America while defying the \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d\u2014the notion that people always overexploit their shared property. Instead, these icons of American individualism represent a rare example of true communal values and collaboration through grit, courage, and hard-won wisdom.",

    "description": "Acclaimed by critics and readers on its first publication in 1987, winner of the Locus Award for Best First Novel, Emma Bull's <i>War for the Oaks</i> is one of the novels that has defined modern urban fantasy.<br /><br />Eddi McCandry sings rock and roll. But she's breaking up with her boyfriend, her band just broke up, and life could hardly be worse. Then, walking home through downtown Minneapolis on a dark night, she finds herself drafted into an invisible war between the faerie folk. Now, more than her own survival is at risk\u2014and her own preferences, musical and personal, are very much beside the point.<br /><br />By turns tough and lyrical, fabulous and down-to-earth, <i>War for the Oaks</i> is a fantasy novel that's as much about this world as about the other one. It's about real love and loyalty, about real music and musicians, about false glamour and true art. It will change the way you hear and see your own daily life.",

    "description": "The day after they moved in, Coraline went exploring....<br /><br />In Coraline's family's new flat are twenty-one windows and fourteen doors. Thirteen of the doors open and close. <br /><br />The fourteenth is locked, and on the other side is only a brick wall, until the day Coraline unlocks the door to find a passage to another flat in another house just like her own. <br /><br />Only it's different. <br /><br />At first, things seem marvelous in the other flat. The food is better. The toy box is filled with wind-up angels that flutter around the bedroom, books whose pictures writhe and crawl and shimmer, little dinosaur skulls that chatter their teeth. But there's another mother, and another father, and they want Coraline to stay with them and be their little girl. They want to change her and never let her go. <br /><br />Other children are trapped there as well, lost souls behind the mirrors. Coraline is their only hope of rescue. She will have to fight with all her wits and all the tools she can find if she is to save the lost children, her ordinary life, and herself. <br /><br />Critically acclaimed and award-winning author Neil Gaiman will delight readers with his first novel for all ages.",

    "description": "<strong>An unforgettable story of love, acceptance, and tradition.</strong> When Maude Chambliss first arrives at Retreat, the seasonal home of her husband's aristocratic family, she is a nineteen-year-old bride fresh from South Carolina's Low Country. Among the patrician men and women who reside in the summer colony on the coast of Maine, her gypsy-like beauty and impulsive behavior immediately brand her an outsider. She, as well as everyone else, is certain she will never fit in. And of course, she doesn't...at first.<br /><br />But over the many summers she spends there, Maude comes to cherish life in the colony, as she does the people who share it with her. There is her husband Peter, consumed with a darkness of spirit; her adored but dangerously fragile children; her domineering mother-in-law, who teaches her that it is the women who posses the strength to keep the colony intact; and Maine native Micah Willis, who is ultimately Maude's truest friend.<br /><br />This brilliant novel, rich with emotion, is filled with appealing, intense, and indomitable characters. Anne Rivers Siddons paints a portrait of a woman determined to preserve the spirit of past generations--and the future of aplaice where she became who she is...a place called <em>Colony</em>.<br /><br />\"An outstanding multigenerational novel...We are hooked from the moment we meet Maude.\" <br /><em>The New York Times</em>",

    "description": "George Eliot's tale of a solitary miser gradually redeemed by the joy of fatherhood, <i>Silas Marner</i> is edited with an introduction and notes by David Carroll in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />Wrongly accused of theft and exiled from a religious community many years before, the embittered weaver Silas Marner lives alone in Raveloe, living only for work and his precious hoard of money. But when his money is stolen and an orphaned child finds her way into his house, Silas is given the chance to transform his life. His fate, and that of Eppie, the little girl he adopts, is entwined with Godfrey Cass, son of the village Squire, who, like Silas, is trapped by his past. <i>Silas Marner</i>, George Eliot's favourite of her novels, combines humour, rich symbolism and pointed social criticism to create an unsentimental but affectionate portrait of rural life.<br /><br />This text uses the Cabinet edition, revised by George Eliot in 1878. David Carroll's introduction is complemented by the original Penguin Classics edition introduction by Q.D. Leavis.<br /><br />Mary Ann Evans (1819-80) began her literary career as a translator, and later editor, of the Westminster Review. In 1857, she published <i>Scenes of Clerical Life</i>, the first of eight novels she would publish under the name of 'George Eliot', including <i>The Mill on the Floss</i>, <i>Middlemarch</i>, and <i>Daniel Deronda</i>.<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>Silas Marner</i>, you might like Nathaniel Hawthorne's <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, also available in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />'I think <i>Silas Marner</i> holds a higher place than any of the author's works. It is more nearly a masterpiece; it has more of that simple, rounded, consummate aspect ... which marks a classical work'<br />Henry James",

    "description": "Enriched Classics offer readers accessible editions of great works of literature enhanced by helpful notes and commentary. Each book includes educational tools alongside the text, enabling students and readers alike to gain a deeper and more developed understanding of the writer and their work.<br /><br />An entrancing but sad story of a poverty-stricken Massachusetts farmer caught in a loveless marriage. The main characters are Ethan Frome, his wife Zenobia, called Zeena, and her young cousin Mattie Silver. Frome and Zeena marry after she nurses his mother in her last illness. Although Frome seems ambitious and intelligent, Zeena holds him back. When her young cousin Mattie comes to stay on their New England farm, Frome falls in love with her. But the social conventions of the day doom their love and their hopes. Ethan\u2019s love for his young cousin leads to one day of explosive emotions with tragic consequences. The story forcefully conveys Wharton\u2019s abhorrence of society\u2019s unbending standards of loyalty. <br /><br />Enriched Classics enhance your engagement by introducing and explaining the historical and cultural significance of the work, the author\u2019s personal history, and what impact this book had on subsequent scholarship. Each book includes discussion questions that help clarify and reinforce major themes and reading recommendations for further research.<br /><br />Read with confidence.",

    "description": "For 1600 years its message lay hidden. When the bound papyrus pages of this lost gospel finally reached scholars who could unlock its meaning, they were astounded. Here was a gospel that had not been seen since the early days of Xianity, &amp; which few experts had even thought existed\u2013a gospel told from the perspective of Judas Iscariot, history\u2019s ultimate traitor. Far from being a villain, the Judas that emerges in its pages is a hero. In this radical reinterpretation, Jesus asks Judas to betray him. In contrast to the New Testament Gospels, Judas is presented as a role model for all those who wish to be disciples of Jesus. He's the one apostle who truly understands Jesus. This volume is the 1st publication of the remarkable gospel since it was condemned as heresy by early Church leaders, most notably by Irenaeus, in 180. Hidden away in a cavern in Middle Egypt, the codex containing the gospel was discovered by farmers in the 1970s. In the intervening years the papyrus codex was bought &amp; sold by antiquities traders, hidden away &amp; carried across three continents, all the while suffering damage that reduced much of it to fragments. In 2001, it finally found its way into the hands of a team of experts who would painstakingly reassemble &amp; restore it. <i>The Gospel of Judas</i> has been translated from its original Coptic into clear prose. It's accompanied by commentary that explains its history in the context of the early Church, offering a new way of understanding the message of Jesus.",

    "description": "John Wood discovered his passion, his greatest success, and his life's work\u2014not at business school or leading Microsoft's charge into Asia in the 1990s\u2014but on a soul-searching trip to the Himalayas. Wood felt trapped between an all-consuming career and a desire to do something lasting and significant. Stressed from the demands of his job, he took a vacation trekking in Nepal because a friend had told him, \"If you get high enough in the mountains, you can't hear Steve Ballmer yelling at you anymore.\"<br /><br />Instead of being the antidote to the rat race, that trip convinced John Wood to divert the boundless energy he was devoting to Microsoft into a cause that desperately needed to be addressed. While visiting a remote Nepalese school, Wood learned that the students had few books in their library. When he offered to run a book drive to provide the school with books, his idea was met with polite skepticism. After all, no matter how well-intentioned, why would a successful software executive take valuable time out of his life and gather books for an impoverished school?<br /><br />But John Wood did return to that school and with thousands of books bundled on the back of a yak. And at that moment, Wood made the decision to walk away from Microsoft and create Room to Read\u2014an organization that has donated more than 1.2 million books, established more than 2,600 libraries and 200 schools, and sent 1,700 girls to school on scholarship\u2014ultimately touching the lives of 875,000 children with the lifelong gift of education.<br /><br /><em>Leaving Microsoft to Change the World</em> chronicles John Wood's struggle to find a meaningful outlet for his managerial talents and entrepreneurial zeal. For every high-achiever who has ever wondered what life might be like giving back, Wood offers a vivid, emotional, and absorbing tale of how to take the lessons learned at a hard-charging company like Microsoft and apply them to one of the world's most pressing problems: the lack of basic literacy.",

    "description": "Meet the little known and even less understood heroes of police work in Las Vegas -- the forensic investigators. Led by veteran Gil Grissom, the remarkable team assigned to the Criminalistics Bureau's graveyard shift -- including Catherine Willows, Warrick Brown, Nick Stokes, and Sara Sidle -- must combine cutting-edge scienti\u00dec methods and old-fashioned savvy as they work to untangle the evidence behind the yellow police tape. <br /><b>SIN CITY</b> <br /> \"If anything happens to me, get this cassette to the police,\" Lynn Pierce told her friends the night she disappeared without a trace. Pierce seemed to be a devout Christian, devoted wife and mother -- but she left behind a recording of her husband threatening to cut her into little pieces. <br /> Jenna Patrick was a professional stripper who said she was trying to get out of the sex trade and into junior college. She wound up strangled to death in a locked room in the back of the club where she worked. What could these two women possibly have had in common -- aside from the fact that they are both victims of homicide? <br /> Find out as Grissom, Willows, and the rest of the CSI team track down a sordid trail of secret lives and private dances, from the saintly to the seedier side of Sin City.",

It tells of a young woman\u2019s passionate love, held like a fortress against the corrupting evil of a totalitarian state.<br /><br />We the Living is not a story of politics, but of the men and women who have to struggle for existence behind the Red banners and slogans. It is a picture of what those slogans do to human beings. What happens to the defiant ones? What happens to those who succumb? <br /><br />Against a vivid panorama of political revolution and personal revolt, Ayn Rand shows what the theory of socialism means in practice.",

And meet Thrasne, a young boatman who trades from town to town, free from the iron control of the towers of the Awakeners, and the priests of the world of the River--free, that is, as long as he never speaks his mind. These two, by design and accident both, are about to discover many truths. And on the Northshore of the River, the truth can kill you.",

Joanna\u2019s first NDE is as fascinating as she imagined \u2014 so astounding that she knows she must go back, if only to find out why that place is so hauntingly familiar.<br /><br />But each time Joanna goes under, her sense of dread begins to grow, because part of her already knows why the experience is so familiar, and why she has every reason to be afraid.<br /><br />Yet just when Joanna thinks she understands, she\u2019s in for the biggest surprise of all \u2014 a shattering scenario that will keep you feverishly reading until the final climactic page.",

When Carlos Ruweda's wife is suddenly taken from him, he discovers a magical gift: In waking dreams, he had clear visions of the fates of \"the disappeared.\" But he cannot \"imagine\" what has happened to his own wife. Driven to near madness, his mind cannot be taken away: imagination, stories, and the mystical secrets of the human spirit.",

The daughter of a powerful lord, Sarah balks at the marriage her father has planned for her. On her wedding day, she impulsively \ufb02ees to the vast, empty marshes outside the city walls, where she meets a young man named Abram, son of a tribe of outsiders. Drawn to this exotic stranger, Sarah spends one night with him and reluctantly returns to her father\u2019s house. But on her return, she secretly drinks a poisonous potion that will make her barren and thus un\ufb01t for marriage.<br /><br />Many years later, Abram returns to Ur and discovers that the lost, rebellious girl from the marsh has been transformed into a splendid woman\u2014the high priestess of the goddess Ishtar. But Sarah gives up her exalted life to join Abram\u2019s tribe and follow the one true God, an invisible deity who speaks only to Abram. It is then that her journey truly begins.<br /><br />From the great ziggurat of Ishtar to the fertile valleys of Canaan to the bedchamber of the mighty Pharaoh himself, Sarah\u2019s story reveals an ancient world full of beauty, intrigue, and miracles.",

    "description": "The Mulvaneys of High Point Farm in Mt. Ephraim, New York, are a large and fortunate clan, blessed with good looks, abundant charisma, and boundless promise. But over the twenty-five year span of this ambitious novel, the Mulvaneys will slide, almost imperceptibly at first, from the pinnacle of happiness, transformed by the vagaries of fate into a scattered collection of lost and lonely souls.It is the youngest son, Judd, now an adult, who attempts to piece together the fragments of the Mulvaneys' former glory, seeking to uncover and understand the secret violation that occasioned the family's tragic downfall. Each of the Mulvaneys endures some form of exile- physical or spiritual - but in the end they find a way to bridge the chasms that have opened up among them, reuniting in the spirit of love and healing.",

    "description": "Yambo, a sixtyish rare-book dealer who lives in Milan, has suffered a loss of memory-he can remember the plot of every book he has ever read, every line of poetry, but he no longer knows his own name, doesn't recognize his wife or his daughters, and remembers nothing about his parents or his childhood. In an effort to retrieve his past, he withdraws to the family home somewhere in the hills between Milan and Turin. There, in the sprawling attic, he searches through boxes of old newspapers, comics, records, photo albums, and adolescent diaries. And so Yambo relives the story of his generation: Mussolini, Catholic education and guilt, Josephine Baker, Flash Gordon, Fred Astaire. His memories run wild, and the life racing before his eyes takes the form of a graphic novel. Yambo struggles through the frames to capture one simple, innocent image: that of his first love.<br /><br /> A fascinating, abundant novel-wide-ranging, nostalgic, funny, full of heart-from the incomparable Eco.",

    "description": "<em>All About Love</em> offers radical new ways to think about love by showing its interconnectedness in our private and public lives. In eleven concise chapters, hooks explains how our everyday notions of what it means to give and receive love often fail us, and how these ideals are established in early childhood. She offers a rethinking of self-love (without narcissism) that will bring peace and compassion to our personal and professional lives, and asserts the place of love to end struggles between individuals, in communities, and among societies. Moving from the cultural to the intimate, hooks notes the ties between love and loss and challenges the prevailing notion that romantic love is the most important love of all.<br /><br />Visionary and original, hooks shows how love heals the wounds we bear as individuals and as a nation, for it is the cornerstone of compassion and forgiveness and holds the power to overcome shame.<br /><br />For readers who have found ongoing delight and wisdom in bell hooks's life and work, and for those who are just now discovering her, <em>All About Love</em> is essential reading and a brilliant book that will change how we think about love, our culture-and one another.",

    "description": "<i>Special Topics in Calamity Physics</i> is a darkly hilarious coming-of-age novel and a richly plotted suspense tale told through the distinctive voice of its heroine, Blue van Meer. After a childhood moving from one academic outpost to another with her father (a man prone to aphorisms and meteoric affairs), Blue is clever, deadpan, and possessed of a vast lexicon of literary, political, philosophical, and scientific knowledge\u2014and is quite the cineaste to boot. In her final year of high school at the elite (and unusual) St. Gallway School in Stockton, North Carolina, Blue falls in with a charismatic group of friends and their captivating teacher, Hannah Schneider. But when the drowning of one of Hannah's friends and the shocking death of Hannah herself lead to a confluence of mysteries, Blue is left to make sense of it all with only her gimlet-eyed instincts and cultural references to guide\u2014or misguide\u2014her.",

Now, in the wake of a shocking crime in nearby Chattanooga, he's called upon by Jess Carter \u2014 the rising star of the state's medical examiners \u2014 to help her unravel a murderous puzzle. But after re-creating the death scene at the Body Farm, Brockton discovers his career, reputation, and life are in dire jeopardy when a second, unexplained corpse appears in the grisly setting.<br /><br />Accused of a horrific crime \u2014 transformed overnight from a respected professor to a hated and feared pariah \u2014 Bill Brockton will need every ounce of his formidable forensic skills to escape the ingeniously woven net that's tightening around him... and to prove the seemingly impossible: his own innocence.",

But when the librarian and his girlfriend must travel to Tijuana, they have a series of strange encounters in Brautigan's 1971 novel.<br /><br />SO THE WIND WON'T BLOW IT ALL AWAY: It is 1979, and a man is recalling the events of his twelfth summer, when he bought bullets for his gun instead of a hamburger. Written just before his death, and published in 1982, this novel foreshadowed Brautigan's suicide.",

C'\u00e9tait le seul gars qui lui faisait quelque chose. Il avait m\u00eame une photo de lui, qu'il regardait souvent. Les gars chez Bug Moran rigolaient, ils trouvaient \u00e7a marrant. \"Qu'est-ce que \u00e7a peut te foutre, Gary Cooper ?\" Lenny ne r\u00e9pondait pas et rangeait soigneusement la photo. \"Tu veux que je te dise, Lenny ? C'est fini, Gary Cooper. Fini pour toujours. Fini, l'Am\u00e9ricain tranquille, s\u00fbr de lui et de son droit, qui est contre les m\u00e9chants, toujours pour la bonne cause, et qui fait triompher la justice et gagne toujours \u00e0 la fin. Adieu l'Am\u00e9rique des certitudes. (...) Ciao, Gary Cooper.\" Les gars se taisaient. Lenny leur tournait le dos, faisait mine de fouiller dans son sac. \u00bb",

Praise for Scott Meyers' first book, <i>Effective C++</i> \"I heartily recommend <i>Effective C++</i> to anyone who aspires to mastery of C++ at the intermediate level or above.\"<br /><i>- The C/C++ User's Journal</i> From the author of the indispensable <i>Effective C++</i>, here are 35 new ways to improve your programs and designs. Drawing on years of experience, Meyers explains how to write software that is <i>more effective</i> more efficient, more robust, more consistent, more portable, and more reusable. In short, how to write C++ software that's just plain better. <i>More Effective C++</i> includes:<br />Proven methods for improving program efficiency, including incisive examinations of the time/space costs of C++ language features<br /><br /><br />Comprehensive descriptions of advanced techniques used by C++ experts, including placement new, virtual constructors, smart pointers, reference counting, proxy classes, and double-dispatching<br /><br /><br />Examples of the profound impact of exception handling on the structure and behavior of C++ classes and functions<br /><br /><br />Practical treatments of new language features, including bool, mutable, explicit, namespaces, member templates, the Standard Template Library, and more. If your compilers don't yet support these features, Meyers shows you how to get the job done without them. <i>More Effective C++</i> is filled with pragmatic, down-to-earth advice you'll use every day. Like <i>Effective C++</i> before it, <i>More Effective C++</i> is essential reading for anyone working with C++.",

    "description": "\"This is <i>Effective C++</i> volume three - it's really that good.\"<br />- Herb Sutter, independent consultant and secretary of the ISO/ANSI C++ standards committee \"There are very few books which all C++ programmers <i>must</i> have. Add <i>Effective STL</i> to that list.\"<br />- Thomas Becker, Senior Software Engineer, Zephyr Associates, Inc., and columnist, <i>C/C++ Users Journal</i> C++'s Standard Template Library is revolutionary, but learning to use it well has always been a challenge. Until now. In this book, best-selling author Scott Meyers (<i> Effective C++ </i>, and <i> More Effective C++ </i>) reveals the critical rules of thumb employed by the experts - the things they almost always do or almost always avoid doing - to get the most out of the library. Other books describe <i>what's in</i> the STL. <i>Effective STL</i> shows you <i>how to use it</i>. Each of the book's 50 guidelines is backed by Meyers' legendary analysis and incisive examples, so you'll learn not only what to do, but also <i>when</i> to do it - and <i>why</i>. Highlights of <i>Effective STL</i> include:<br />Advice on choosing among standard STL containers (like vector and list), nonstandard STL containers (like hash_set and hash_map), and non-STL containers (like bitset).<br />Techniques to maximize the efficiency of the STL and the programs that use it.<br />Insights into the behavior of iterators, function objects, and allocators, including things you should <i>not</i> do.<br />Guidance for the proper use of algorithms and member functions whose names are the same (e.g., find), but whose actions differ in subtle (but important) ways.<br />Discussions of potential portability problems, including straightforward ways to avoid them. Like Meyers' previous books, <i>Effective STL</i> is filled with proven wisdom that comes only from experience. Its clear, concise, penetrating style makes it an essential resource for every STL programmer.",

    "description": "<i>A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian</i> was bestselling author Marina Lewycka's bestselling debut novel which has sold over one million copies worldwide. Lewycka tells the side-splittingly funny story of two feuding sisters, Vera and Nadezhda, who join forces against their father's new, gold-digging girlfriend.<br /><br /><i>Two years after my mother died, my father fell in love with a glamorous blonde Ukrainian divorc\u00e9e. He was eighty-four and she was thirty-six. She exploded into our lives like a fluffy pink grenade, churning up the murky water, bringing to the surface a sludge of sloughed-off memories, giving the family ghosts a kick up the backside.</i><br /><br />Sisters Vera and Nadezhda must aside a lifetime of feuding to save their \u00e9migr\u00e9 engineer father from voluptuous gold-digger Valentina. With her proclivity for green satin underwear and boil-in-the-bag cuisine, she will stop at nothing in her pursuit of Western wealth.<br /><br />But the sisters' campaign to oust Valentina unearths family secrets, uncovers fifty years of Europe's darkest history and sends them back to roots they'd much rather forget . . . .",

    "description": "In the dazzling new thriller from the master of dark suspense, the hand of fate reaches out to touch an ordinary man with greatness. So long as he is ready. So long as he is, above all, afraid.<br /><br />Jimmy Tock comes into the world on the very night his grandfather leaves it. As a violent storm rages outside the hospital, Rudy Tock spends long hours walking the corridors between the expectant fathers' waiting room and his dying father's bedside. It's a strange vigil made all the stranger when, at the very height of the storm's fury, Josef Tock suddenly sits up in bed and speaks coherently for the first and last time since his stroke.<br /><br />What he says before he dies is that there will be five dark days in the life of his grandson \u2013 five dates whose terrible events Jimmy will have to prepare himself to face. The first is to occur in his 20th year; the second in his 23rd year; the third in his 28th; the fourth in his 29th; the fifth in his 30th.<br /><br />Rudy is all too ready to discount his father's last words as a dying man's delusional rambling. But then he discovers that Josef also predicted the moment of his grandson's birth to the minute, as well as his exact height, weight, and the fact that Jimmy would be born with syndactyly \u2013 the unexplained anomaly of fused digits on his left foot. Suddenly, the old man's predictions take on a chilling significance.<br /><br />What terrifying events await Jimmy on these five dark days? What nightmares will he face? What challenges must he survive? As the novel unfolds, picking up Jimmy's story at each of these crisis points, the path he must follow will defy every expectation. And with each crisis he faces, he will move closer to a fate he could never have imagined. For who Jimmy Tock is and what he must accomplish on the five days his world turns is a mystery as dangerous as it is wondrous \u2013 a struggle against an evil so dark and pervasive only the most extraordinary of human spirits can shine through.",

The family history refracted here is mutable, notable, more gravid than grave. THE BALLOONISTS holds a fresh line on confession, biography, and the formal uses of information in poetry\"-Rebecca Wolff.",

    "description": "A Christmas Carol is a novella by English author Charles Dickens. It was first published by Chapman &amp; Hall on 19 December 1843. Carol tells the story of a bitter old miser named Ebenezer Scrooge and his transformation resulting from a supernatural visit by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the Ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Yet to Come. The novella met with instant success and critical acclaim. The book was written and published in early Victorian era Britain, a period when there was strong nostalgia for old Christmas traditions together with the introduction of new customs, such as Christmas trees and greeting cards. Dickens' sources for the tale appear to be many and varied, but are, principally, the humiliating experiences of his childhood, his sympathy for the poor, and various Christmas stories and fairy tales.",

In the darkest years of Nazi occupation and genocide, Etty Hillesum remained a celebrant of life whose lucid intelligence, sympathy, and almost impossible gallantry were themselves a form of inner resistance. The adult counterpart to Anne Frank, Hillesum testifies to the possibility of awareness and compassion in the face of the most devastating challenge to one's humanity. She died at Auschwitz in 1943 at the age of twenty-nine.<br />",

    "description": "The award-winning Italian author Melania G. Mazzucco weaves her own family history into a great American novel of the immigrant experience. A sweeping tale of discovery, love, and loss, Vita is a passionate blend of biography and autobiography, of fantasy and fiction.<br /><br />In April 1903, the steamship Republic spills more than two thousand immigrants onto Ellis Island. Among them are Diamante, age twelve, and Vita, nine, sent by their poor families in southern Italy to make their way in America. Amid the chaos and splendor of New York, the misery and criminality of Little Italy, and the shady tenants of Vita's father's decrepit Prince Street boarding house, Diamante and Vita struggle to survive, to create a new life, and to become American. From journeys west in search of work to journeys back to Italy in search of their roots, to Vita's son's encounter with his mother's home town while serving as an army captain in World War II, Vita touches on every aspect of the heartbreaking and inspiring immigrant story.<br /><br />The award-winning Italian author Melania G. Mazzucco weaves her own family history into a great American novel of the immigrant experience. A sweeping tale of discovery, love, and loss, Vita is a passionate blend of biography and autobiography, of fantasy and fiction.",

Before she can blink, Ave's fielding marriage proposals, fighting off greedy family members, organizing a celebration for visiting celebrities, and planning the trip of a lifetime-a trip that could change her view of the world and her own place in it forever. <br /><br />Brimming with humor and wise notions of small-town life, <i>Big Stone Gap</i> is a gem of a book with a giant heart. . . .",

The postwar boom is ripe with opportunities for talented girls with ambition, and Lucia becomes an apprentice to an up-and-coming designer at chic B. Altman's department store on Fifth Avenue. Engaged to her childhood sweetheart, the steadfast Dante DeMartino, Lucia is torn when she meets a handsome stranger who promises a life of uptown luxury that career girls like her only read about in the society pages. Forced to choose between duty to her family and her own dreams, Lucia finds herself in the midst of a sizzling scandal in which secrets are revealed, her beloved career is jeopardized, and the Sartoris' honor is tested.",

Humiliated, his body truncated, his life circumscribed, he turns away from his friends.<br /><br />He hires a nurse named Marijana, with whom he has a European childhood in common: hers in Croatia, his in France. Tactfully and efficiently she ministers to his needs. But his feelings for her, and for her handsome teenage son, are complicated by the sudden arrival on his doorstep of the celebrated Australian novelist Elizabeth Costello, who threatens to take over the direction of his life and the affairs of his heart.",

    "description": "Winner of the 2006 Pulitzer Prize For Fiction. From the author of the acclaimed YEAR OF WONDERS, an historical novel and love story set during a time of catastrophe, on the front lines of the American Civil War. Acclaimed author Geraldine Brooks gives us the story of the absent father from Louisa May Alcott's Little Women - and conjures a world of brutality, stubborn courage and transcendent love. An idealistic abolitionist, March has gone as chaplain to serve the Union cause. But the war tests his faith not only in the Union - which is also capable of barbarism and racism - but in himself. As he recovers from a near-fatal illness, March must reassemble and reconnect with his family, who have no idea of what he has endured. A love story set in a time of catastrophe, March explores the passions between a man and a woman, the tenderness of parent and child, and the life-changing power of an ardently held belief.",

Now an ancient Russian immigrant, Leonka claims to be the last living witness to the Romanovs' brutal murders and sets down the dark secrets of his past with the imperial family. Does he hold the key to the many questions surrounding the family's murder? Historically vivid and compelling, The Kitchen Boy is also a touching portrait of a loving family that was in many ways similar, yet so different, from any other. <br />",

            "description": "The fictional Multiverse, which consists of several universes, many layered dimensions, spheres, and alternative worlds, is the place where the eternal struggle between Law and Chaos, the two main forces of Moorcock's worlds, takes place. In all these dimensions and worlds, these forces constantly war for supremacy. Since the victory of Law or Chaos would cause the Multiverse either to become permanently static or totally formless, the Cosmic Balance enforces certain limits which the powers of Law and Chaos violate at their peril. Law, Chaos, and the Balance are active, but seemingly non-sentient, forces which empower various champions and representatives.\n    \n    The Eternal Champion, a Hero who exists in all dimensions, times and worlds, is the one who is chosen by fate to fight for the Cosmic Balance; however, he often does not know of his role, or, even worse, he struggles against it, never to succeed. Since his role is to intervene when either Law or Chaos have gained an excess of power, he is always doomed to be surrounded by strife and destruction, although he may go through long periods of relative quiet.\n    \n    All the incarnations of the Eternal Champion are facets of each other, and the Champion may also be aided by a companion, who, like himself, exists in various incarnations. Likewise the Champion is often associated with a romantic interest that is possibly an aspect of an eternal figure. Other characters in the various books have occasionally crossed over from one universe to another, although it is unclear what their status in the multiverse may be. Normally, the incarnations of the Champion do not interact and are treated as a series of serial incarnations for facets of a single consciousness, but various cataclysmic events (such as the end of a Cycle of Cycles of the multiverse's progression, or an invasion by hostile entities from an entirely separate multiverse) may bring them together in various ways. This is very dangerous (it causes strains on the fabric of the multiverse as well as mental issues for the Champion), but amplifies the Champion's power enormously.\n    \n    In every aspect, the Champion is a warrior almost without peer: when he wields some version of his usual weapon, the Black Sword (known by various names such as Stormbringer or Kanajana, although not all versions of the Sword are the same and some are active entities in their own right) few can stand against him. He is also usually an adept, if often unwilling, leader of fighters and has strategic and tactical abilities.

    "description": "<blockquote>\n  <i>\"Like everyone, I am born naked.\"</i>\n  <br /><br /></blockquote>With this opening line of Naslund's compelling new novel, a very human Marie Antoinette invites readers to live her story as she herself experiences it. From the lush gardens of Versailles to the lights and gaiety of Paris, the verdant countryside of France, and finally the stark and terrifying isolation of a prison cell, the young queen's life is joyful, poignant, and harrowing by turns. As her world of unprecedented royal splendor crumbles, the charming Marie Antoinette matures into a heroine of inspiring stature, one whose nobility arises not from the circumstance of her birth but from her courageous spirit.<br /><br />Marie Antoinette was a child of fourteen when her mother, the Empress of Austria, arranged for her to leave her family and her country to become the wife of the fifteen-year-old Dauphin, the future King of France. Coming of age in the most public of arenas, the young queen embraces her new family and the French people, and she is embraced in return. Eager to be a good wife and strong queen, she shows her new husband nothing but love and encouragement, though he repeatedly fails to consummate their marriage and in doing so, fails to give her the thing she\u2014and the people of France\u2014desires most: a child and an heir to the throne.<br /><br />Deeply disappointed and isolated in her own intimate circle apart from the social life of the court, the queen allows herself to remain ignorant of the country's growing economic and political crises. She entrusts her soul to her women friends, her music teacher, her hairdresser, the ambassador from Austria, and a certain Swedish count so handsome that admirers label him \"the Picture.\" When her innocent and well-chaperoned pilgrimage to watch the sun rise is viciously misrepresented in satiric pamphlets as a drunken orgy, the people begin to turn against her. Poor harvests, bitter winters, war debts, and poverty precipitate rebellion and revenge as the royal family and many nobles are caught up in a murderous time known as \"the Terror.\"<br /><br />With penetrant insight into new historical scholarship and with wondrous narrative skill, Naslund offers an intimate, fresh, and dramatic re-creation of this compelling woman that goes beyond popular myth. <i>Abundance</i> reveals a compassionate and spontaneous Marie Antoinette who rejected the formality and rigid protocol of the court; an enchanting and tenderhearted outsider who was loved by her adopted homeland and people until she became the target of revolutionary cruelty and violence; a dethroned queen whose depth of character sustained her in even the worst of times.<br /><br />Once again, Sena Jeter Naslund has shed new light on an important moment of historical change and made that time as real to us as the one we are living now. Exquisitely detailed, beautifully written, heartbreaking and powerful, <i>Abundance</i> is a novel that is impossible to put down.",

    "description": "Piven and Cloward have updated their classic work on the history and function of welfare to cover the American welfare state's massive erosion during the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton years. The authors present a boldly comprehensive, brilliant new theory to explain the comparative underdevelopment of the U.S. welfare state among advanced industrial nations. Their conceptual framework promises to shape the debate within current and future administrations as they attempt to rethink the welfare system and its role in American society.<br /><br />\"Uncompromising and provocative. . . . By mixing history, political interpretation and sociological analysis, Piven and Cloward provide the best explanation to date of our present situation . . . no future discussion of welfare can afford to ignore them.\"<br /> --Peter Steinfels, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>",

    "description": "This is the story of Louis, as told in his own words, of his journey through mortal and immortal life. Louis recounts how he became a vampire at the hands of the radiant and sinister Lestat and how he became indoctrinated, unwillingly, into the vampire way of life. His story ebbs and flows through the streets of New Orleans, defining crucial moments such as his discovery of the exquisite lost young child Claudia, wanting not to hurt but to comfort her with the last breaths of humanity he has inside. Yet, he makes Claudia a vampire, trapping her womanly passion, will, and intelligence inside the body of a small child. Louis and Claudia form a seemingly unbreakable alliance and even \"settle down\" for a while in the opulent French Quarter. Louis remembers Claudia's struggle to understand herself and the hatred they both have for Lestat that sends them halfway across the world to seek others of their kind. Louis and Claudia are desperate to find somewhere they belong, to find others who understand, and someone who knows what and why they are.<br /><br />Louis and Claudia travel Europe, eventually coming to Paris and the ragingly successful Theatre des Vampires--a theatre of vampires pretending to be mortals pretending to be vampires. Here they meet the magnetic and ethereal Armand, who brings them into a whole society of vampires. But Louis and Claudia find that finding others like themselves provides no easy answers and in fact presents dangers they scarcely imagined.<br /><br />Originally begun as a short story, the book took off as Anne wrote it, spinning the tragic and triumphant life experiences of a soul. As well as the struggles of its characters, Interview captures the political and social changes of two continents. The novel also introduces Lestat, Anne's most enduring character, a heady mixture of attraction and revulsion. The book, full of lush description, centers on the themes of immortality, change, loss, sexuality, and power.<br />source: annerice.com",

    "description": "Marianne Dashwood wears her heart on her sleeve, and when she falls in love with the dashing but unsuitable John Willoughby she ignores her sister Elinor's warning that her impulsive behaviour leaves her open to gossip and innuendo. Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. Through their parallel experience of love - and its threatened loss - the sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love.",

It also offers some pretty important insights into the lives we lead in the here and now. Using the Wisdom Traditions of the Bible as a backdrop, Wisdom from the Five People You Meet in Heaven brings us into a discussion of what might truly be important in life. Illustrating biblical concepts with examples from Albom's novel, this study guide for individuals or groups parallels the characters in The Five People You Meet in Heaven with the themes and insights from Wisdom Literature. Wisdom from the Five People You Meet in Heaven explores the orientation of Wisdom Literature toward life, sharing its teachings on issues of fairness, sacrifice, forgiveness, love, suffering, and what we can learn about our own character. From the Popular Insights series.",

    "description": "<i>On Call</i> begins with a newly-minted doctor checking in for her first day of residency--wearing the long white coat of an MD and being called \"Doctor\" for the first time. Having studied at Yale and Dartmouth, Dr. Emily Transue arrives in Seattle to start her internship in Internal Medicine just after graduating from medical school. This series of loosely interconnected scenes from the author's medical training concludes her residency three years later.<br /><br />During her first week as a student on the medical wards, Dr. Transue watched someone come into the emergency room in cardiac arrest and die. Nothing like this had ever happened to her before-it was a long way from books and labs. So she began to record her experiences as she gained confidence putting her book knowledge to work.<br /><br />The stories focus on the patients Dr. Transue encountered in the hospital, ER and clinic; some are funny and others tragic. They range in scope from brief interactions in the clinic to prolonged relationships during hospitalization. There is a man newly diagnosed with lung cancer who is lyrical about his life on a sunny island far away, and a woman, just released from a breathing machine after nearly dying, who sits up and demands a cup of coffee.<br /><br />Though the book has a great deal of medical content, the focus is more on the stories of the patients' lives and illnesses and the relationships that developed between the patients and the author, and the way both parties grew in the course of these experiences.<br /><br />Along the way, the book describes the life of a resident physician and reflects on the way the medical system treats both its patients and doctors. <i>On Call</i> provides a window into the experience of patients at critical junctures in life and into the author's own experience as a new member of the medical profession.",

    "description": "Poetry. Sufism. Middle Eastern Literature. Arab American Studies. Translated from the Persian by Reza Ordoubadian. Shamsed-din Hafez was born some six hundred years ago in southern Iran, but his poems have universal and contemporary appeal. Wherever Persian is known, he is easily recited by both king and common man. Those uncertain about matters of love, fortune, or any other situation open a page of his collection of poems at random and in it see their dilemmas untangled. His turns of phrase have enriched the Persian lexicon and entered everyday language; this has made him Persian culture's most read, quoted, and revered figure. Reza Ordoubadian's translations make the poems of Hafez accessible to the English language reader, while remaining faithful to the nuances of Hafez's language and thought in the original Persian.",

In attempting to hitchhike round Ireland with a fridge, Tony Hawks did both, and his foolhardiness led him to one of the best experiences of his life. Joined by his trusty traveling companion-cum-domestic appliance, he made his way from Dublin to Donegal, from Sligo through Mayo, Galway, Clare, Kerry, Cork, Wexford, Wicklow--and back again to Dublin. In their month of madness, Tony and his fridge met a real prince, a bogus king, and the fridge got christened. They surfed together, entered a bachelor festival, and one of them had sex without the other knowing. And unexpectedly, the fridge itself became a momentary focus for the people of Ireland.<br /><br />An international bestseller, <i>Round Ireland with a Fridge</i> is a classic travel adventure in the tradition of Bill Bryson with a dash of Dave Barry.<br /></div>",

Little House in the Big Woods<br /><br />Wolves and panthers and bears roam the deep Wisconsin woods in the late 1870's. In those same woods, Laura lives with Pa and Ma, and her sisters, Mary and Baby Carrie, in a snug little house built of logs. Pa hunts and traps. Ma makes her own cheese and butter. All night long, the wind howls lonesomely, but Pa plays the fiddle and sings, keeping the family safe and cozy.Little House on the Prairie<br /><br />Pa Ingalls decides to sell the little log house, and the family sets out for Indian country They travel from Wisconsin to Kansas, and there, finally, Pa builds their little house on the prairie. Sometimes farm life is difficult, even dangerous, but Laura and her family are kept busy and are happy with the promise of their new life on the prairie.Farmer Boy<br /><br />While Laura Ingalls grows up in a little house on the western prairie, Almanzo Wilder is living on a big farm in New York State. Almanzo and his brother and sisters work at their chores from dawn to supper most days -- no matter what the weather. There is still time for fun, though, especially with the horses, which Almanzo loves more than anything.On the Banks of Plum Creek<br /><br />Laura's family's first home in Minnesota is made of sod, but Pa builds a clean new house made of sawed lumber beside Plum Creek. The money for materials will come from their first wheat crop. Then, just before the wheat is ready to harvest, a strange glittering cloud fills the sky, blocking out the sun. Soon millions of grasshoppers cover the field and everything on the farm. In a week's time, there is no wheat crop left at all.By the Shores of Silver Lake<br /><br />Pa Ingalls heads west to the unsettled wilderness of the Dakota Territory. When Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and baby Grace join him, they become the first settlers in the town of De Smet. And Pa begins work on the first building in what will soon be a brand-new town on the shores of Silver Lake.The Long Winter<br /><br />The first terrible storm comes to the barren prairie in October. Then it snows almost without stopping until April. Snow has reached the rooftops, and no trains can get through with food or coal. The people of De Smet are starving, including Laura's family, who wonder how they're going to make it through this terrible winter. It is young Almanzo Wilder who finally understands what needs to be done. He must save the town, even if it means risking his own life.Little Town on the Prairie<br /><br />The long winter is over. With spring come socials, parties, and \"Literaries.\" There is also work to be done. Laura spends many hours each day sewing shirts to help send Mary to a college for the blind. But in the evenings, Laura makes time for a new caller, Almanzo Wilder.These Happy Golden Years<br /><br />Laura is teaching school, and it's terrifying Most of the students are taller than she is, and she must sleep away from home for the first time. Laura is miserable, but the money is needed to keep Mary in a college for the blind. And every Friday -- no matter what the weather -- Almanzo Wilder arrives to take Laura home to her family for the weekend. Laura and Almanzo are courting, and even though she's not yet sixteen, she knows that this is a time for new beginnings.The First Four Years<br /><br />Laura and Almanzo Wilder have just been married Their life on a small prairie homestead begins with high hopes. But each year seems to bring unexpected disasters -- storms, sickness, fire, and unpaid debts. These first four years call for courage, strength, and a great deal of determination. Always, though, there is love, especially for the newest member of the family -- baby Rose.",

Drawing on hundreds of interviews, confidential internal memos, diaries, and meeting notes, Woodward shows how Clinton and his advisers grappled with questions of lasting importance -- the federal deficit, health care, welfare reform, taxes, jobs. One of the most intimate portraits of a sitting president ever published, this edition includes an afterword on Clinton's efforts to save his presidency.",

When the list of suspects includes her new lover, the celebrity chef at a posh Napa Valley eatery, the personal risks of her investigation rise dramatically. With the same eclectic crew of gourmet friends and sassy co-workers who helped her in Sharpshooter, Sunny proves that she has a nose for crime as well as for a good Cabernet Sauvignon.",

    "description": "The dust storms that terrorized the High Plains in the darkest years of the Depression were like nothing ever seen before or since. Timothy Egan\u2019s critically acclaimed account rescues this iconic chapter of American history from the shadows in a tour de force of historical reportage. Following a dozen families and their communities through the rise and fall of the region, Egan tells of their desperate attempts to carry on through blinding black dust blizzards, crop failure, and the death of loved ones. Brilliantly capturing the terrifying drama of catastrophe, Egan does equal justice to the human characters who become his heroes, \u201cthe stoic, long-suffering men and women whose lives he opens up with urgency and respect\u201d (New York Times).<br /><br />In an era that promises ever-greater natural disasters, The Worst Hard Time is \u201carguably the best nonfiction book yet\u201d (Austin Statesman Journal) on the greatest environmental disaster ever to be visited upon our land and a powerful cautionary tale about the dangers of trifling with nature.",

Here we see the system through the eyes of the men and women who experience it, not only in the courtroom but in the lockup, the jury room, the judge's chambers, the spectators' gallery. From the daily grind of the court to the highest-profile case of the year, Steve Bogira\u2019s masterful investigation raises fundamental issues of race, civil rights, and justice in America.",

Just hours after marrying the beautiful Angela Vicario, everyone agrees, Bayardo San Roman returned his bride in disgrace to her parents. Her distraught family forced her to name her first lover; and her twin brothers announced their intention to murder Santiago Nasar for dishonoring their sister.<br /><br />Yet if everyone knew the murder was going to happen, why did no one intervene to try and stop it? The more that is learned, the less is understood, and as the story races to its inexplicable conclusion, an entire society--not just a pair of murderers\u2014is put on trial.",

    "description": "Richard Jury returns to the back streets and back rooms of London in \"The New York Times\" bestselling series <br /> When an old friend pulls Richard Jury into the investigation of a wealthy bachelor's murder, Jury's not sure what's more perplexing: the circumstances of the fellow's death, the conflicted stories of the man's past, or the motivations of the case's lead detective?the beautiful and forbidding Lu Aguilar. What Jury is sure of is that he's in over his head, both with the inscrutable and challenging Aguilar and the false leads surrounding the once-charismatic Billy Maples, last seen in a club named Dust. <br /> A web of clues draws Jury to the trendy Clerkenwell galleries, clubs, and hotels, to the dark stories behind Maples's family, and to the Sussex town of Rye, where Billy had temporarily taken up the tenancy of Lamb House, the charming home where Henry James composed his three masterworks . . . and a place with secrets of its own. With Melrose Plant investigating Lamb House, Aguilar interceding, and the appearance of Maples's mysterious young nephew, Scotland Yard's finest?and now infamous?will need every bit of his intelligence and quiet charm to crack the case.",

    "description": "Millions of readers around the world have fallen in love with the novels of the New York Times bestselling author Adriana Trigiani. In\" Home to Big Stone Gap,\" she tells her most powerful story yet, full of humor and heart, wisdom and hope. <br />Nestled in the lush Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, the town of Big Stone Gap has been home for Ave Maria Mulligan Machesney and her family for generations. She's been married to her beloved Jack for nearly twenty years, raised one child and buried another, and run a business that binds her community together, all while holding her tight circle of family and friends close. <br />But with her daughter, Etta, having flown the nest to enchanting Italy, Ave Maria has reached a turning point. When a friend's postcard arrives with the message \"It's time to live your life for you,\" Ave Maria realizes that it's time to go in search of brand-new dreams. But before she can put her foot on the path, her life is turned upside down. <br />Ave Maria agrees to helm the town musical, a hilarious reunion of local talent past and present. A lifelong friendship collapses when a mysterious stranger comes to town and reveals a long-buried secret. An unexpected health crisis threatens her family. An old heartthrob reappears, challenging her marriage and offering a way out of her troubles. An opportunistic coal company comes to town and threatens to undermine the town's way of life and the mountain landscape Ave Maria has treasured since she was a girl. Now she has no choice but to reinvent her world, her life, and herself, whether she wants to or not. <br />Trigiani is at her best in this exquisite page-turner. \"Home to Big Stone Gap\" is an emotional and unforgettable journey that reminds us that you can go home again and again. <br />From \"BOOKLIST\"<br />*STAR* Trigiani, Adriana. Home to Big Stone Gap. Nov. 2006. 301p. Random, $25.95 (1-4000-6008-7). <br />Tucked in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia is Big Stone Gap, the bucolic backdrop for Trigiani's popular series. In this fourth entry, Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney and her husband, Jack, must come to terms with the absence of daughter Etta, newly married and living in Italy. (The country holds a special place in Ave Maria's heart: her biological father, Mario, whom she learned of and met only after her mother's death, is Italian). Ave Maria has plenty to keep her mind off missing her only child (the MacChesney's son, Joe, died of leukemia at age four). She's a full-time pharmacist and the newly appointed director of the town's annual musical. Then comes news that her longtime friend, glamorous librarian Iva Lou, has been keeping a startling secret for nearly 20 years. Other developments, including a health scare for Jack and a Christmas visit from a colorful former resident, move the plot along briskly. With her original cast of characters, playwright and television writer Trigiani blends playfulness and pathos in this evocative portrait of a small southern town. Fans of the Big Stone Gap series can look forward to a feature film; Trigiani has written the screenplay and is slated to direct. -\"Allison Block<br />\"\"Is there ever trouble for Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney, heroine of Trigiani's beloved Big Stone Gap novels, starting with her married daughter's move to Italy and leading right up to a stranger's disturbing appearance in town.\"-\"Library Journal\" <br />Praise for the Big Stone Gap novels: <br />\"Delightfully quirky . . . chock-full of engaging, oddball characters and unexpected plot twists.\"<br />-\"People\" (Book of the Week) <br />\"Funny, charming, and original.\"<br />-Fannie Flagg <br />\"Satisfying reading . . . As skillfully as Ms. Trigiani makes us laugh, she makes us cry.\"<br />-\"Richmond Times-Dispatch\" <br />\"Heartwarming . . . Everything that really matters is here: humor, romance, wisdom, and drama.\"<br />-\"The Dallas Morning News\"",

    "description": "New York Times bestselling author Adriana Trigiani, beloved by millions of readers around the world for her humor, warmth, and captivating storytelling in the Big Stone Gap trilogy and Lucia, Lucia, takes on love, lust, tricky family dynamics, and home decorating in Rococo, the uproarious tale of a small Italian American town poised for a makeover it never expected.<br /><br />Bartolomeo di Crespi is the acclaimed interior decorator of Our Lady of Fatima, New Jersey. To date, Bartolomeo has hand-selected every chandelier, sconce, and ottoman in OLOF, so when the renovation of the local church is scheduled, he assumes there is only one man for the job.<br /><br />From the dazzling shores of New Jersey to the legendary fabric houses of New York City, from the prickly purveyors of fine art in London to luscious Santa Margherita on the Mediterranean coast of Italy, Bartolomeo is on a mission to bring talent, sophistication, and his aesthetic vision to his hometown.<br /><br />Trigiani\u2019s glittering mosaic of small-town characters sparkles: Bartolomeo\u2019s hilarious sister, Toot, is in desperate need of a postdivorce transformation\u2013thirteen years after the fact; \u201cThe Benefactor,\u201d Aurelia Mandelbaum, the richest woman in New Jersey, has a lust for French interiors and a long-held hope that Bartolomeo will marry her myopic daughter, Capri; Father Porporino, the pastor with a secret, does his best to keep a lid on a simmering scandal; and Eydie Von Gunne, the chic international designer, steps in and changes the course of Bartolomeo\u2019s creative life, while his confidante, cousin Christina Menecola, awaits rescue from an inconsolable grief. <br /><br />Plaster of Paris, polished marble, and unbridled testosterone arrive in buckets when Bartolomeo recruits Rufus McSherry, a strapping, handsome artist, and Pedro Allercon, a stained-glass artisan, to work with him on the church\u2019s interior. Together, the three of them will do more than blow the dust off the old Fatima frescoes\u2013they will turn the town upside down, challenge the faithful, and restore hope where there once was none.<br /><br />Brilliantly funny and as fanciful as flocked wallpaper, filled with glamorous locales from New Jersey to Europe, from Sunday Mass to the American Society of Interior Designers soir\u00e9e at the Plaza Hotel, <b>Rococo</b> is Trigiani\u2019s masterpiece, a classic comedy with a heart of gold leaf.<br /><br /><br />\"A veritable crazy quilt of quirky Italian Americans ... Trigiani weaves all these subplots together with wonderful ease; every seam is perfectly straight, every pleat in place. Bartolomeo would expect no less. A-.\" -- Entertainment Weekly<br /><br />\"Clever ... Creating characters so lively they bounce off the page and possessing a wit so subtle that even the best jokes seem effortless, Trigiani is a master storyteller. Equal parts sass and silliness, Rococo is an artfully designed tale with enough brio to make Frank Gehry proud.\"-- People<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "Winner of the 2007 BookBrowse Award for Most Popular Book.<br /><br />An atmospheric, gritty, and compelling novel of star-crossed lovers, set in the circus world circa 1932, by the bestselling author of Riding Lessons. <br /><br />When Jacob Jankowski, recently orphaned and suddenly adrift, jumps onto a passing train, he enters a world of freaks, drifters, and misfits, a second-rate circus struggling to survive during the Great Depression, making one-night stands in town after endless town. A veterinary student who almost earned his degree, Jacob is put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It is there that he meets Marlena, the beautiful young star of the equestrian act, who is married to August, the charismatic but twisted animal trainer. He also meets Rosie, an elephant who seems untrainable until he discovers a way to reach her. <br /><br />Beautifully written, Water for Elephants is illuminated by a wonderful sense of time and place. It tells a story of a love between two people that overcomes incredible odds in a world in which even love is a luxury that few can afford.",

In death his hold on them may be even stronger. Wife, daughter, granddaughter, employee, mistress: As Morrison\u2019s protagonists stake their furious claim on Cosey\u2019s memory and estate, using everything from intrigue to outright violence, she creates a work that is shrewd, funny, erotic, and heartwrenching.",

    "description": "He is perhaps the most acclaimed, revered and widely read writer of our time, and in this first volume of a planned trilogy, Gabriel Garcia Marquez begins to tell the story of his life. <i>Living to Tell the Tale</i> spans Marquez's life from his birth in 1927 through the beginning of his career as a writer to the moment in the 1950s when he proposed to the woman who would become his wife. It is a tale of people, places and events as they occur to him: family, work, politics, books and music, his beloved Columbia, parts of his history until now undisclosed and incidents that would later appear, transmuted and transposed in his fiction. A vivid, powerful, beguiling memoir that gives us the formation of Marquez as a writer and as a man.",

    "description": "Cultural Writing. Latino/Latina Studies. Fiction. Perhaps the most admired of all Marguerite Duras's novels, MODERATO CANTABILE is almost a twentieth-century MADAME BOVARY in its picture of the dissatisfied wife of a rich provincial industrialist, who forms an attachment to one of her husband's workmen. This is not the normal chronicle of adultery but a carefully woven tapestry of emotion. A haunting, oblique love story, it perfectly demonstrates the Duras technique of associating human emotion with locales and landscapes, and of describing longing, loneliness and love through references to weather, temperature, the color of the sky and the sound of the sea.",

    "description": "The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it, To Kill A Mockingbird became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.<br /><br />Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.",

In this provocative, unfailingly intelligent, thoroughly researched, and surprisingly convincing big idea book, Steven Johnson draws from fields as diverse as neuroscience, economics, and media theory to argue that the pop culture we soak in every day\u2014from <b>Lord of the Rings</b> to <b>Grand Theft Auto</b> to <b>The Simpsons</b>\u2014has been growing more sophisticated with each passing year, and, far from rotting our brains, is actually posing new cognitive challenges that are actually making our minds measurably sharper. After reading <i>Everything Bad is Good for You</i>, you will never regard the glow of the video game or television screen the same way again.\u00a0<br /><br />With a new afterword by the author.<br /><br /> Steven Johnson's newest book, <i>How We Got to Now</i>, is now available from Riverhead Books.",

    "description": "The inspiration for the film that won the 2004 Sundance Film Festival Audience Award for Best Documentary, <i>The Corporation </i>contends that the corporation is created by law to function much like a psychopathic personality, whose destructive behavior, if unchecked, leads to scandal and ruin.<br /><br />Over the last 150 years the corporation has risen from relative obscurity to become the world\u2019s dominant economic institution. Eminent Canadian law professor and legal theorist Joel Bakan contends that today's corporation is a pathological institution, a dangerous possessor of the great power it wields over people and societies.<br /><br />In this revolutionary assessment of the history, character, and globalization of the modern business corporation, Bakan backs his premise with the following observations:<br /><br />-The corporation\u2019s legally defined mandate is to pursue relentlessly and without exception its own economic self-interest, regardless of the harmful consequences it might cause to others.<br /> -The corporation\u2019s unbridled self-interest victimizes individuals, society, and, when it goes awry, even shareholders and can cause corporations to self-destruct, as recent Wall Street scandals reveal.<br /> -Governments have freed the corporation, despite its flawed character, from legal constraints through deregulation and granted it ever greater authority over society through privatization.<br /><br />But Bakan believes change is possible and he outlines a far-reaching program of achievable reforms through legal regulation and democratic control.<br /><br />Featuring in-depth interviews with such wide-ranging figures as Nobel Prize winner Milton Friedman, business guru Peter Drucker, and cultural critic Noam Chomsky, <i>The Corporation </i>is an extraordinary work that will educate and enlighten students, CEOs, whistle-blowers, power brokers, pawns, pundits, and politicians alike.",

Thus began the holy wars that would focus the power of Europe against a common enemy and become the stuff of romantic legend. In reality the Crusades were a series of rabidly savage conflicts in the name of piety. And, as Armstrong demonstrates in this fascinating book, their legacy of religious violence continues today in the Middle East, where the age-old conflict of Christians, Jews, and Muslims persists.",

    "description": "<i>The New York Times</i> bestselling follow-up to the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>A Million Little Pieces</i>-the heartrending story of a friendship between a newly-sober James and the charismatic, high-living mobster he met in rehab, Leonard. <br /><br /><i>A Million Little Pieces</i> was the first Oprah Book Club pick by a living author in over two years. It instantly became a #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, a #1 <i>USA Today</i> bestseller, and a #1 <i>Publishers Weekly</i> bestseller, with over 1.7 million copies in print. <br /><br /><i>My Friend Leonard</i> picks up right where <i>Pieces</i> leaves off. A <i>New York Times</i> bestseller in its own right before the Oprah pick, <i>My Friend Leonard</i> is James Frey's story of his friendship with Leonard, the larger-than-life mobster who \"adopted\" James as he left rehab. Leonard, who offers James lucrative-if illegal, mysterious, and slightly dangerous-employment when he needs it. Leonard, of the secret deals, of the surprising passions that belie his violent career choice, of fantastic generosity and ferocious loyalty. Leonard, who has been holding on to some remarkable secrets, and who has invested in their friendship more than James could ever imagine. <br /><br /><i>My Friend Leonard</i> is, at its core, about the responsibility that comes with loving someone and going out on any number of limbs to care for them. And it is a book that proves that one of the most provocative literary voices of his generation is also one of the most emphatically human.",

Friedman, twice winner of the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting, and now the Foreign Affairs columnist on the op-ed page of the <i>New York Times</i>, drew on his ten years in the Middle East to write a book that <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> called \"a sparkling intellectual guidebook... an engrossing journey not to be missed.\" Now with a new chapter that brings the ever-changing history of the conflict in the Middle East up to date, this seminal historical work reaffirms both its timeliness and its timelessness. \"If you're only going to read one book on the Middle East, this is it.\" -- Seymour Hersh",

    "description": "<i>\"Like all of the other doors I had met in the castle, this one opened at my approach. The room it revealed was a large, warm, and gracious one. On one wall to my left a first was burning in a fireplace; two armchairs were drawn up before it. One chair was empty. In the other a massive shadow sat. I caught a gleam of dark-green velvet on what might have been a knee in the shadowed armchair.<br /><br />\"'Good evening, Beauty,' said a great harsh voice.\"</i><br /><br />A young woman, well educated and honourable, accepts responsibility for her father's act and leaves her family to enter the enchanted world of castle and Beast. The Beast she finds is not the one she imagined, but can she stay with him?<br /><br />A gifted storyteller embellishes the classic tale, developing a new and very real world of her own in a love story that has all the wonder and magic of the fairy tale.",

    "description": "In <i>A Room of One's Own</i>, Virginia Woolf imagines that Shakespeare had a sister. A sister equal to Shakespeare in talent, and equal in genius, but whose legacy is radically different. This imaginary woman never writes a word and dies by her own hand, her genius unexpressed. If only she had found the means to create, argues Woolf, she would have reached the same heights as her immortal sibling. In this classic essay, Virginia Woolf takes on the establishment, using her gift of language to dissect the world around her and give voice to those who are without. Her message is a simple one: women must have some money and a room of their own in order to have the freedom to create.",

    "description": "Why would a married woman with a thoroughly Protestant background and often more doubt than faith be drawn to the ancient practice of monasticism, to a community of celibate men whose days are centered around a rigid schedule of prayer, work, and scripture? This is the question that poet Kathleen Norris asks us as, somewhat to her own surprise, she found herself on two extended residencies at St. John's Abbey in Minnesota. Part record of her time among the Benedictines, part meditation on various aspects of monastic life, <i>The Cloister Walk</i> demonstrates, from the rare perspective of someone who is both an insider and outsider, how immersion in the cloistered world -- its liturgy, its ritual, its sense of community -- can impart meaning to everyday events and deepen our secular lives. In this stirring and lyrical work, the monastery, often considered archaic or otherworldly, becomes immediate, accessible, and relevant to us, no matter what our faith may be.<br /><br />* A New York Times bestseller for 23 weeks<br />* A New York Times Notable Book of the Year",

Through the ages, libraries have not only accumulated and preserved but also shaped, inspired, and obliterated knowledge. Matthew Battles, a rare books librarian and a gifted narrator, takes us on a spirited foray from Boston to Baghdad, from classical scriptoria to medieval monasteries, from the Vatican to the British Library, from socialist reading rooms and rural home libraries to the Information Age.<br /><br />He explores how libraries are built and how they are destroyed, from the decay of the great Alexandrian library to scroll burnings in ancient China to the destruction of Aztec books by the Spanish\u2014and in our own time, the burning of libraries in Europe and Bosnia.<br /><br />Encyclopedic in its breadth and novelistic in its telling, this volume will occupy a treasured place on the bookshelf next to Baker's <i>Double Fold</i>, Basbanes's <i>A Gentle Madness</i>, Manguel's <i>A History of Reading</i>, and Winchester's <i>The Professor and the Madman</i>.",

    "description": "<b>In <i>Persuasion</i>, her last novel, Jane Austen reveals her most mature dissection of people, place and social setting.</b><br /><br />Like the earlier works <i>Persuasion</i> is a tale of love and marriage, told with the irony, insight and just evaluation of human conduct which sets her novels apart. But the heroine - like the author - is more mature; the tone of the writing more sombre. Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth have met and separated years before. Their reunion forces a recognition of the false values that drove them apart. The characters who embody those values are the subjects of some of the most withering satire that Jane Austen ever wrote.",

But this coincidence of birth has consequences Saleem is not prepared for: telepathic powers that connect him with 1,000 other \"midnight's children\"--all born in the initial hour of India's independence--and an uncanny sense of smell that allows him to sniff out dangers others cannot perceive. Inextricably linked to his nation, Saleem's biography is a whirlwind of disasters and triumphs that mirror the course of modern India at its most impossible and glorious. <br /><br />Ebullient, operatic, comic, and serious, this novel is a wild, astonishing evocation of the maturity of a vast and complicated land and its people--a brilliant incarnation of the universal human comedy, Indian-style.<br />(back cover)",

Thoughtful and inspiring, it offers a rare vision of hope that will redefine what we think about our neighbors, our future, and ourselves.<br /><br />In this timely, provocative, and uplifting journey, the bestselling author of Walking the Bible searches for the man at the heart of the world's three monotheistic religions -- and today's deadliest conflicts.<br />At a moment when the world is asking, \"Can the religions get along?\" one figure stands out as the shared ancestor of Jews, Christians, and Muslims. One man holds the key to our deepest fears -- and our possible reconciliation. Abraham.<br />Bruce Feiler set out on a personal quest to better understand our common patriarch. Traveling in war zones, climbing through caves and ancient shrines, and sitting down with the world's leading religious minds, Feiler uncovers fascinating, little-known details of the man who defines faith for half the world.<br />Both immediate and timeless, Abraham is a powerful, universal story, the first-ever interfaith portrait of the man God chose to be his partner. Thoughtful and inspiring, it offers a rare vision of hope that will redefine what we think about our neighbors, our future, and ourselves.",

Elle va d\u00e9couvrir \u00e0 ses d\u00e9pens l'implacable rigeur de l'autorit\u00e9 d'entreprise, en m\u00eame temps qu les codes de conduite, incompr\u00e9hensibles au profane, qui gouvernent la vie sociale au pays du Soleil levant.<br /><br />D'erreurs en maladresses et en \u00e9checs, commence alors pour elle, comme dans un mauvais r\u00eave, la descente inexorable dans les degr\u00e9s de la hi\u00e9rarchie, jusqu'au rang de surveillante des toilettes, celui de l'humiliation derni\u00e8re. Une course absurde vers l'ab\u00eeme - image de la vie -, o\u00f9 l'humour percutant d'Am\u00e9lie Nothomb fait mouche \u00e0 chaque ligne.<br /><br />Entre le rire et l'angoisse, cette satire des nouveaux despotismes aux \u00e9chos kafka\u00efens a conquis un immense public et valu \u00e0 l'auteur d'<i>Hygi\u00e8ne de l'assassin</i> le Grand Prix du roman de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise en 1999.",

In it Strachey cleverly exposes the self-seeking ambitions of Cardinal Manning and the manipulative, neurotic Florence Nightingale; and in his essays on Dr Arnold and General Gordon his quarries are not only his subjects but also the public-school system and the whole structure of nineteenth-century liberal values.",

Gleaned from Pema Chdrn's best-selling books, these passages explore topics of loving-kindness, mindfulness, \"nowness,\" letting go, and working with painful emotions. They also offer meditation instructions for heightening awareness and overcoming habitual patterns that block happiness. By the end of the cycle of teachings, the listener will have completed the basic training for becoming a \"warrior-bodhisattva,\" one who courageously takes up the path of awakening compassion.",

    "description": "It is the year 4022; all of the ancient country of Usa has been buried under many feet of detritus from a catastrophe that occurred back in 1985. Imagine, then, the excitement that Howard Carson, an amateur archeologist at best, experienced when in crossing the perimeter of an abandoned excavation site he felt the ground give way beneath him and found himself at the bottom of a shaft, which, judging from the DO NOT DISTURB sign hanging from an archaic doorknob, was clearly the entrance to a still-sealed burial chamber. Carson's incredible discoveries, including the remains of two bodies, one of then on a ceremonial bed facing an altar that appeared to be a means of communicating with the Gods and the other lying in a porcelain sarcophagus in the Inner Chamber, permitted him to piece together the whole fabric of that extraordinary civilization.",

When the Buddha was asked to sum up his teaching in a single word, he said, \"Awareness.\" The Buddha taught how to see directly into the nature of experience. His observations and insights are plain, practical, and down-to-earth, and they deal exclusively with the present. In Buddhism Plain and Simple, Steve Hagen presents these uncluttered, original teachings in everyday, accessible language unencumbered by religious ritual, tradition, or belief.",

    "description": "There was a time when reading Joseph Heller's classic satire on the murderous insanity of war was nothing less than a rite of passage. Echoes of Yossarian, the wise-ass bombardier who was too smart to die but not smart enough to find a way out of his predicament, could be heard throughout the counterculture. As a result, it's impossible not to consider <i>Catch-22</i> to be something of a period piece. But 40 years on, the novel's undiminished strength is its looking-glass logic. Again and again, Heller's characters demonstrate that what is commonly held to be good, is bad; what is sensible, is nonsense. <p>Yossarian says, \"You're talking about winning the war, and I am talking about winning the war and keeping alive.\" </p><p> \"Exactly,\" Clevinger snapped smugly. \"And which do you think is more important?\" </p><p> \"To whom?\" Yossarian shot back. \"It doesn't make a damn bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead.\" </p><p> \"I can't think of another attitude that could be depended upon to give greater comfort to the enemy.\" </p><p> \"The enemy,\" retorted Yossarian with weighted precision, \"is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.\" </p><p> Mirabile dictu, the book holds up post-Reagan, post-Gulf War. It's a good thing, too. As long as there's a military, that engine of lethal authority, <i>Catch-22</i> will shine as a handbook for smart-alecky pacifists. It's an utterly serious and sad, but damn funny book.</p>",

    "description": "Bestselling winner of the 1986 Pulitzer Prize, Lonesome Dove is an American classic. First published in 1985, Larry McMurtry's epic novel combined flawless writing with a storyline and setting that gripped the popular imagination, and ultimately resulted in a series of four novels and an Emmy-winning television miniseries. Now, with an introduction by the author, Lonesome Dove is reprinted in an S&amp;S Classic Edition. <br />Lonesome Dove, by Larry McMurtry, the author of Terms of Endearment, is his long-awaited masterpiece, the major novel at last of the American West as it really was. <br />A love story, an adventure, an American epic, Lonesome Dove embraces all the West -- legend and fact, heroes and outlaws, whores and ladies, Indians and settiers -- in a novel that recreates the central American experience, the most enduring of our national myths. <br />Set in the late nineteenth century, Lonesome Dove is the story of a cattle drive from Texas to Montana -- and much more. It is a drive that represents for everybody involved not only a daring, even a foolhardy, adventure, but a part of the American Dream -- the attempt to carve out of the last remaining wilderness a new life. <br />Augustus McCrae and W. F. Call are former Texas Rangers, partners and friends who have shared hardship and danger together without ever quite understanding (or wanting to understand) each other's deepest emotions. Gus is the romantic, a reluctant rancher who has a way with women and the sense to leave well enough alone. Call is a driven, demanding man, a natural authority figure with no patience for weaknesses, and not many of his own. He is obsessed with the dream of creating his own empire, and with the need to conceal a secret sorrow of his own. The two men could hardly be more different, but both are tough, redoubtable fighters who have learned to count on each other, if nothing else. <br />(front flap)",

    "description": "The first edition of Programming Pearls was one of the most influential books I read early in my career, and many of the insights I first encountered in that book stayed with me long after I read it. Jon has done a wonderful job of updating the material. I am very impressed at how fresh the new examples seem. - Steve McConnell When programmers list their favorite books, Jon Bentley's collection of programming pearls is commonly included among the classics. Just as natural pearls grow from grains of sand that irritate oysters, programming pearls have grown from real problems that have irritated real programmers. With origins beyond solid engineering, in the realm of insight and creativity, Bentley's pearls offer unique and clever solutions to those nagging problems. Illustrated by programs designed as much for fun as for instruction, the book is filled with lucid and witty descriptions of practical programming techniques and fundamental design principles. It is not at all surprising that Programming Pearls has been so highly valued by programmers at every level of experience. In this revision, the first in 14 years, Bentley has substantially updated his essays to reflect",

Naipaul, benefit so obviously from the perspective Tharoor offers, that of an Indian with a profound empathy for his native culture, combined with the insight made possible by following India's progress from afar.\" <br />-- \"New York Times\" \"A hard-hitting, powerfully analytical and supremely articulate new book. . . . Tharoor discusses the flawed miracle of Indian democracy from various angles, opting for a take-no-prisoners approach as he criticizes politicians, unpacks layers of misguided governmental policies and exposes the atavistic tendencies of special-interest pols.\" <br />-- \"Newsday\"<br /><br />\"Tharoor looks back at his country's first 50 years of independence, describing its challenges (illiteracy, poverty, sectarian violence and the ever-present caste problem) and its triumphs (a thriving democracy, a burgeoning economy) in lively, informative prose. He is particularly adept at describing all that India and Indians are not--not the same ethnicity, religion or language--to arrive at the nation's essence: that the singular thing about India was that you could only speak of it in the plural.\" <br />-- \"Seattle Times",

    "description": "This modern classic by one of our leading scholars seeks to explain the values prevalent in today's mass culture by tracing them back to their roots in the Victorian era. As religion lost its hold on the public mind, clergymen and educated women, powerless and insignificant in the society of the time, together exerted a profound effect on the only areas open to their influence: the arts and literature. Women wrote books that idealized the very qualities that kept them powerless: timidity, piety, and a disdain for competition. Sentimental values that permeated popular literature continue to influence modern culture, preoccupied as it is with glamour, banal melodrama, and mindless consumption.<br /><br />This new paperback edition, with a new Preface, will reach yet more readers with its persuasive and provocative theory. Richard Bernstein of <i>The New York Times </i>said: \"Her remarkable scholarship is going to set the standard for a long time to come.\"",

    "description": "At once an incredible adventure narrative and a penetrating biographical portrait, <i>The River of Doubt</i> is the true story of Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s harrowing exploration of one of the most dangerous rivers on earth.<br /><br />The River of Doubt\u2014it is a black, uncharted tributary of the Amazon that snakes through one of the most treacherous jungles in the world. Indians armed with poison-tipped arrows haunt its shadows; piranhas glide through its waters; boulder-strewn rapids turn the river into a roiling cauldron.<br /><br />After his humiliating election defeat in 1912, Roosevelt set his sights on the most punishing physical challenge he could find, the first descent of an unmapped, rapids-choked tributary of the Amazon. Together with his son Kermit and Brazil\u2019s most famous explorer, C\u00e2ndido Mariano da Silva Rondon, Roosevelt accomplished a feat so great that many at the time refused to believe it. In the process, he changed the map of the western hemisphere forever.<br /><br />Along the way, Roosevelt and his men faced an unbelievable series of hardships, losing their canoes and supplies to punishing whitewater rapids, and enduring starvation, Indian attack, disease, drowning, and a murder within their own ranks. Three men died, and Roosevelt was brought to the brink of suicide. <i>The River of Doubt</i> brings alive these extraordinary events in a powerful nonfiction narrative thriller that happens to feature one of the most famous Americans who ever lived.<br />From the soaring beauty of the Amazon rain forest to the darkest night of Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s life, here is Candice Millard\u2019s dazzling debut.",

He had come to see if the rumors were true\u2014if an army of blue-suited soldiers had swept in from the East and utterly defeated his ancestral enemies. As Narbona gazed down on the battlements and cannons of a mighty fort the invaders had built, he realized his foes had been vanquished\u2014but what did the arrival of these \u201cNew Men\u201d portend for the Navajo?<br /><br />Narbona could not have known that \u201cThe Army of the West,\u201d in the midst of the longest march in American military history, was merely the vanguard of an inexorable tide fueled by a self-righteous ideology now known as \u201cManifest Destiny.\u201d For twenty years the Navajo, elusive lords of a huge swath of mountainous desert and pasturelands, would ferociously resist the flood of soldiers and settlers who wished to change their ancient way of life or destroy them.",

    "description": "Precious Ramotswe, of the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency, is on the case again, this time assisting the self-made founder of a chain of hairdressing salons who wants to unearth the real intentions of her four suitors, each possibly more interested in her money than her heart.<br /><br />Here is the fifth novel in the internationally bestselling No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency hit series. Once again we are transported to Gaborone, capital city of Botswana, and into the world of Mma Ramotswe and her friends. <br /><br />THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY.<br />FOR ALL CONFIDENTIAL MATTERS AND ENQUIRIES. <br />SATISFACTION GUARANTEED FOR ALL PARTIES.<br />UNDER PERSONAL MANAGEMENT. <br /><br />Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni are still engaged, but with no immediate plans to get married. Mma Ramotswe wonders when a wedding date will be named, but she is anxious to avoid putting pressure on her fianc\u00e9. For indeed he has other things on his mind -- particularly a frightening request (involving a parachute jump) made by Mma Potokwani, the persuasive matron of the orphan farm. <br /><br />Mma Ramotswe herself has weighty matters on her mind. She has been approached by a wealthy lady to check up on several suitors. Are these men interested in her or just her money? This may be difficult to find out, but it's just the kind of case Mma Ramotswe likes and she is, as we know, a very intuitive lady. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Mma Makutsi -- plucky assistant detective and deputy manager of the Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors garage -- is moving. Her entrepreneurial venture, the Kalahari Typing School for Men, is thriving and with this new income she has rented two rooms in a house. Her spare time is occupied with planning the move, the d\u00e9cor and her new life in a house with running water all to herself. <br /><br />In the background of all this is Botswana, a country of empty spaces and echoing skies, a country so beautiful and entrancing that it breaks your heart. Mma Ramotswe has prepared the bush tea and is waiting for us to join her.",

She is already busier than usual at the detective agency when added to her concerns are a strange intruder in her house on Zebra Drive and the baffling appearance of a pumpkin. And then there is Mma Makutsi, who decides to treat herself to dance lessons, only to be partnered with a man who seems to have two left feet. Nor are things running quite as smoothly as they usually do at Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. Mma Ramotswe\u2019s husband, the estimable Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, is overburdened with work even before one of his apprentices runs off with a wealthy woman. But what finally rattles Mma Ramotswe\u2019s normally unshakable composure is a visitor who forces her to confront a secret from her past. . . . <br /><br />All this unfolds against the sunlit background of Mma Ramotswe\u2019s beloved homeland, Botswana\u2013a land of empty spaces, echoing skies, and an endless supply of soothing bush tea.",

    "description": "Welcome to the critically acclaimed HBO drama series \"The Wire,\" hailed as \"the best show on television, period\" by the \"San Francisco Chronicle.\" \"The New York Times\" calls it \"a vital part of the television landscape...unvarnished realism.\" \"Time\" declares that \"The Wire,\" \"like its underfunded, workaday cops, just plugged away until it outshone everything else on TV.\"\"The Wire\" stands not only as riveting drama but also as a sociopolitical treatise with ambitions beyond any television serial. The failure of the drug war, the betrayal of the working class, the bureaucratization of the culture and the cost to individual dignity -- such are the themes of the drama's first two seasons. And with every new episode of season three and beyond, another layer of modern urban life will be revealed. Gritty, densely layered, and realistic, \"The Wire\" is series television at its very best, told from the point of view of the Baltimore police, their targets, and many of those caught in the middle.<br /><br />Rafael Alvarez -- a reporter, essayist, and staff writer for the show -- brings the reader inside, detailing many of the real-life incidents and personalities that have inspired the show's storylines and characters, providing the reader with insights into the city of Baltimore -- itself an undeniable character in the series. Packed with photographs and featuring an introduction by series creator and executive producer David Simon, as well as essays by acclaimed authors<br /><br />George Pelecanos, Laura Lippman, and Anthony Walton, here is an invaluable resource for both fans of the show and viewers who have yet to discover \"The Wire.\"<br /><br />Hollywood has long used the cop drama to excite andentertain, and Hollywood has always dictated the terms. But \"The Wire\" is filmed entirely in Baltimore, conceived by Baltimoreans, and written by rust-belt journalists and novelists intimately familiar with the urban landscape. It's as close as television has yet come to allowing an American city to tell its own tale.",

    "description": "Henri Charri\u00e8re, called \"Papillon,\" for the butterfly tattoo on his chest, was convicted in Paris in 1931 of a murder he did not commit. Sentenced to life imprisonment in the penal colony of French Guiana, he became obsessed with one goal: escape. After planning and executing a series of treacherous yet failed attempts over many years, he was eventually sent to the notorious prison, Devil's Island, a place from which no one had ever escaped . . . until Papillon. His flight to freedom remains one of the most incredible feats of human cunning, will, and endurance ever undertaken.<br /><br />Charri\u00e8re's astonishing autobiography, <i>Papillon</i>, was published in France to instant acclaim in 1968, more than twenty years after his final escape. Since then, it has become a treasured classic -- the gripping, shocking, ultimately uplifting odyssey of an innocent man who simply would not be defeated.",

    "description": "<p> From the acclaimed author of <i>River Town</i> comes a rare portrait, both intimate and epic, of twenty-first-century China as it opens its doors to the outside world. </p> <p> A century ago, outsiders saw China as a place where nothing ever changes. Today the country has become one of the most dynamic regions on earth. That sense of time\u2014the contrast between past and present, and the rhythms that emerge in a vast, ever-evolving country\u2014is brilliantly illuminated by Peter Hessler in <i>Oracle Bones</i>, a book that explores the human side of China's transformation. </p> <p> Hessler tells the story of modern-day China and its growing links to the Western world as seen through the lives of a handful of ordinary people. In addition to the author, an American writer living in Beijing, the narrative follows Polat, a member of a forgotten ethnic minority, who moves to the United States in search of freedom; William Jefferson Foster, who grew up in an illiterate family and becomes a teacher; Emily, a migrant factory worker in a city without a past; and Chen Mengjia, a scholar of oracle-bone inscriptions, the earliest known writing in East Asia, and a man whose tragic story has been lost since the Cultural Revolution. All are migrants, emigrants, or wanderers who find themselves far from home, their lives dramatically changed by historical forces they are struggling to understand. </p> <p> Peter Hessler excavates the past and puts a remarkable human face on the history he uncovers. In a narrative that gracefully moves between the ancient and the present, the East and the West, Hessler captures the soul of a country that is undergoing a momentous change before our eyes. </p>",

Now Turin himself describes in detail the science, evidence, and long history of this debate, from the beginnings of organic chemistry to the present day, and pays homage to those before him who got it right. This fascinating and accessible account will appeal to anyone who has ever wondered about smell, still the most mysterious of the senses.",

    "description": "We all witness, in advertising and on supermarket shelves, the fierce competition for our food dollars. In this engrossing expos\u00e9, Marion Nestle goes behind the scenes to reveal how the competition really works and how it affects our health. The abundance of food in the United States--enough calories to meet the needs of every man, woman, and child twice over--has a downside. Our overefficient food industry must do everything possible to persuade people to eat <i>more</i>--more food, more often, and in larger portions--no matter what it does to waistlines or well-being.<br /><br />Like manufacturing cigarettes or building weapons, making food is very big business. Food companies in 2000 generated nearly $900 billion in sales. They have stakeholders to please, shareholders to satisfy, and government regulations to deal with. It is nevertheless shocking to learn precisely how food companies lobby officials, co-opt experts, and expand sales by marketing to children, members of minority groups, and people in developing countries. We learn that the food industry plays politics as well as or better than other industries, not least because so much of its activity takes place outside the public view.<br /><br />Editor of the 1988 <i>Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health, </i>Nestle is uniquely qualified to lead us through the maze of food industry interests and influences. She vividly illustrates food politics in action: watered-down government dietary advice, schools pushing soft drinks, diet supplements promoted as if they were First Amendment rights. When it comes to the mass production and consumption of food, strategic decisions are driven by economics--not science, not common sense, and certainly not health.<br /><br />No wonder most of us are thoroughly confused about what to eat to stay healthy. An accessible and balanced account, <i>Food Politics </i>will forever change the way we respond to food industry marketing practices. By explaining how much the food industry influences government nutrition policies and how cleverly it links its interests to those of nutrition experts, this pathbreaking book helps us understand more clearly than ever before what we eat and why.",

    "description": "How do we decide what foods to eat? In recent years, this simple question has become complicated beyond belief--as supermarkets have grown to warehouse size, and as the old advice to eat foods from four food groups has been overrun by questions about organic foods, hormones, pesticides, carbohydrates, \"trans \"fats, omega-3s, supplements, health claims, extreme diets, and, above all, obesity.<br />Fortunately, Marion Nestle is here to tell us what's what--to give us the facts we need to make sensible choices from the bewildering array of foods available to us. With \"What to Eat,\" this renowned nutritionist takes us on a guided tour of the supermarket, explaining the issues with verve and wit as well as a scientist's expertise and a food lover's experience.<br />Today's supermarket is ground zero for the food industry, a place where the giants of agribusiness compete for sales with profits--not nutrition or health--in mind. Nestle walks us through the supermarket, section by section: produce, dairy, meat, fish, packaged foods, breads, juices, bottled waters, and more. Along<br />the way, she untangles the issues, decodes the labels, clarifies the health claims, and debunks the sales hype. She tells us how to make sensible choices based on freshness, taste, nutrition, health, effects on the environment, and, of course, price. With Nestle as our guide, we learn what it takes to make wise food choices<br />and are inspired to act with confidence on that knowledge.<br />\"What to Eat \"is \"the \"guide to healthy eating today: comprehensive, provocative, revealing, rich in common sense, informative, and a pleasure to read. Marion Nestle received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the James Beard Foundation--the food world's highest honor--as well as the foundation's book prize. She is the author of \"Food Politics\" and \"Safe Food,\" and was featured in the documentary \"Super Size Me.\" A native of New York, she raised her family in California and now lives in Greenwich Village, where she teaches at New York University. How should you decide what foods to eat? As supermarkets have grown to warehouse size, this simple question has become complicated beyond belief. Fortunately, Marion Nestle--renowned for her sage advice on food and nutrition--is here to cut through the confusion and lay out what you need to know. In \"What to Eat,\" she takes us on a guided tour of the American supermarket and shows us exactly how to feed ourselves and our families wisely and well. <br />With sharp humor, expertise, and a food-lover's delight, Nestle guides us through the supermarket sections--produce, dairy, meat, fish, breads, and juices, and then to the \"center aisles,\" where big profits are made. Along the way, she reveals the big food companies' marketing practices, explains complex labels in clear language, and tells us what we need to know about: <br />- wild and farm-raised<br />- frozen and fresh<br />- organic, natural, and conventional<br />- carbs, omega-3s, and \"trans\" fats<br />- pesticides and the environment <br />- portion size, labeling, and nutrition claims<br />- supplements, additives, and preservatives <br />- food safety \"The industry wants you to believe there are no good foods or bad foods. Well, that's not true. And I can't think of anyone who knows the difference better than Marion Nestle.\"--Eric Schlosser, author of \"Fast Food Nation\" \"Not only is \"What to Eat\" the most comprehensive guide to the political and nutritional choices we make shopping for food, but it's also full of up-to-date research on health.\"--Susan Salter Reynolds, \"Los Angeles\"\" Times Book Review\" \"With this comprehensive guide, Nestle, a nutritionist, makes the weekly trip to the grocery less daunting and a healthy diet more attainable.\"--\"Science News\" \"Part muckraking journalism, part reference book and part consumer guide, \"What to Eat\" is organized in the manner suggested by the subtitle: as a walk down each grocery store aisle with a companionable Ph. D. researcher as the guide. It is a simple, yet effective, concept for organizing what otherwise could have become a mind-numbing amount of information.\"--Steve Weinberg, \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" \"When it comes to the increasingly treacherous landscape of the American supermarket, with its marketing hype and competing health claims, Marion Nestle is an absolutely indispensable guide: knowledgeable, eminently sane--and wonderful company, too.\"--Michael Pollan, author of \"The Botany of Desire\" <br />\"The industry wants you to believe there are no good foods or bad foods. Well, that's not true. And I can't think of anyone who knows the difference better than Marion Nestle.\"--Eric Schlosser, author of \"Fast Food Nation\" <br />\"According to nutritionist Nestle, the increasing confusion among the general public about what to eat comes from two sources: experts who fail to create a holistic view by isolating food components and health issues, and a food industry that markets items on the basis of profits alone. She suggests that, often, research findings are deliberately obscure to placate special interests. Nestle says that simple, common-sense guidelines available decades ago still hold true: consume fewer calories, exercise more, eat more fruits and vegetables and, for today's consumers, less junk food. The key to eating well, Nestle advises, is to learn to navigate through the aisles (and thousands of items) in large supermarkets. To that end, she gives readers a virtual tour, highlighting the main concerns of each food group, including baby, health and prepared foods, and supplements. Nestle's prose is informative and entertaining; she takes on the role of detective, searching for clues to the puzzle of healthy and satisfying nutrition. Her intelligent and reassuring approach will likely make readers venture more confidently through the jungle of today's super-sized stores.\"--\"Publishers Weekly \"",

The most popular and beloved American historical novel ever written, Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind is unparalleled in its portrayal of men and women at once larger than life but as real as ourselves. Now bestselling writer Alexandra Ripley brings us back to Tara and reintroduces us to the characters we remember so well: Rhett, Ashley, Mammy, Suellen, Aunt Pittypat, and, of course, Scarlett. As the classic story, first told over half a century ago, moves forward, the greatest love affair in all fiction is reignited; amidst heartbreak and joy, the endless, consuming passion between Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler reaches its startling culmination. Rich with surprises at every turn and new emotional, breathtaking adventures, Scarlett satisfies our longing to reenter the world of Gone With the Wind, and like its predecessor, Scarlett will find an eternal place in our hearts.",

Their superiors are indifferent; the commanding officer of the air base stands in their way; but Silva and Lituma are determined to uncover the truth.<br /><br /><i>Who Killed Palomino Molero</i>, an entertaining and brilliantly plotted mystery, takes up one of Vargas Llosa\u2019s characteristic themes: the despair at how hard it is to be an honest man in a corrupt society.<br /></div>",

    "description": "Mario Vargas Llosa, renowned as a novelist, is one of our most brilliant and provocative public intellectuals as well. In \"Making Waves,\" the first collection of his essays, he explores, with characteristic brio and elegance, his long-standing preoccupations - literature and politics, Europe and the Americas, and the relations among them all. We follow Vargas Llosa from his native Peru to Madrid and then to Paris, the setting of essays on his great precursors Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Albert Camus, as well as a comic account of his visit to the tomb of Rin Tin Tin and an affecting memoir of his time in the city as an aspiring writer in the 1960s. In passionately critical essays on the Cuban revolution and its aftermath, Vargas Llosa takes up vital questions of Latin American independence, while in essays on Faulkner, Garcia Marquez, and Julio Cortazar - and in an exchange with Gunter Grass - he ponders magic realism. In more recent articles, he considers the terrorism of Peru's Shining Path and the presidency of Alberto Fujimori - and the failures of the English public-school system, which made his son into a Rastafarian. The essays in \"Making Waves\" are full of Mario Vargas Llosa's unflagging literary intensity and moral and political integrity. They are an important addition to the body of work of this major international writer.",

    "description": "With <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i>, Ann Radcliffe raised the Gothic romance to a new level and inspired a long line of imitators. Portraying her heroine's inner life, creating a thick atmosphere of fear, and providing a gripping plot that continues to thrill readers today, <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i> is the story of orphan Emily St. Aubert, who finds herself separated from the man she loves and confined within the medieval castle of her aunt's new husband, Montoni. Inside the castle, she must cope with an unwanted suitor, Montoni's threats, and the wild imaginings and terrors that threaten to overwhelm her.<br /><br /> This new edition includes an introduction that discusses the publication and early reception of the novel, the genre of Gothic romance, and Radcliffe's use of history, exotic settings, the supernatural, and poetry.",

    "description": "An acclaimed bestseller and international sensation, Patrick Suskind's classic novel provokes a terrifying examination of what happens when one man's indulgence in his greatest passion\u2014his sense of smell\u2014leads to murder.<br /><br />In the slums of eighteenth-century France, the infant Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is born with one sublime gift-an absolute sense of smell. As a boy, he lives to decipher the odors of Paris, and apprentices himself to a prominent perfumer who teaches him the ancient art of mixing precious oils and herbs. But Grenouille's genius is such that he is not satisfied to stop there, and he becomes obsessed with capturing the smells of objects such as brass doorknobs and frest-cut wood. Then one day he catches a hint of a scent that will drive him on an ever-more-terrifying quest to create the \"ultimate perfume\"\u2014the scent of a beautiful young virgin. Told with dazzling narrative brillance, <b>Perfume</b> is a hauntingly powerful tale of murder and sensual depravity.<br /><br />Translated from the German by John E. Woods.",
