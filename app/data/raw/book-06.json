    "description": "Years after his escape, posing as scholarly Dr. Fell, curator of a grand family's palazzo, Hannibal lives the good life in Florence, playing lovely tunes by serial killer/composer Henry VIII and killing hardly anyone himself. Clarice is unluckier: in the novel's action-film-like opening scene, she survives an FBI shootout gone wrong, and her nemesis, Paul Krendler, makes her the fall guy. Clarice is suspended, so, unfortunately, the first cop who stumbles on Hannibal is an Italian named Pazzi, who takes after his ancestors, greedy betrayers depicted in Dante's Inferno. Pazzi is on the take from a character as scary as Hannibal: Mason Verger. When Verger was a young man busted for raping children, his vast wealth saved him from jail. All he needed was psychotherapy--with Dr. Lecter. Thanks to the treatment, Verger is now on a respirator, paralyzed except for one crablike hand, watching his enormous, brutal moray eel swim figure eights and devour fish. His obsession is to feed Lecter to some other brutal pets.",

    "description": "Brilliantly weaving impeccable historical research with stirring storytelling, Edward Rutherfurd explores our shared Celtic roots in a magnificent epic of Ireland spanning eleven centuries. While vividly conveying the passions and struggles that shaped particularly the character of Dublin, Rutherfurd portrays the major events in Irish history: the tribal culture of pagan Ireland; the mission of Saint Patrick; the coming of the Vikings; the making of treasures like the Book of Kells; and the tricks of Henry II, which gave England its first foothold in medieval Ireland. Through the interlocking stories of a memorable cast of characters\u2013druids and chieftains, monks and smugglers, noblewomen and farmwives, laborers and orphans, rebels and cowards\u2013Rutherfurd captures the essence of a place and its people in a thrilling story steeped in the tragedy and glory that are Ireland.",

    "description": "Arthur Penhaligon's first days at his new school don't go too well, particularly when a fiendish Mister Monday appears, gives Arthur a magical clock hand, and then orders his gang of dog-faced goons to chase Arthur around and get it back. But when the confused and curious boy discovers that a mysterious virus is spreading through town, he decides to enter an otherworldly house to stop it. After meeting Suzy Blue and the first part of \"the Will\" (a frog-looking entity that knows everything about the House), Arthur learns that he's been selected as Rightful Heir to the House and must get the other part of the clock hand in order to defeat Monday. That means getting past Monday's henchmen and journeying to the Dayroom itself. Thankfully, Arthur is up to the challenge, but as he finds out, his fight seems to be only one-seventh over.<br /><br />With a weapon-wielding hero and a villain who doesn't make Mondays any nicer, Nix's Keys to the Kingdom launch is imaginative and gripping. After an action-packed crescendo to the book's middle -- when Arthur finally learns his destiny -- Nix keeps the drama going and doesn't let it fall. By the end, you might be winded from all the fantastic explanation, but you'll definitely be salivating for what's to come.",

Guiding the way are some of literature's most beguiling characters: the Russian brothers plagued by memories of a fateful sleigh ride, Antonia's desperately homesick father and self-indulgent mother, and the coy Lena Lingard. Holding the pastoral society's heart, of course, is the bewitching, free-spirited Antonia.",

    "description": "Preserved in China for more than 2,000 years before it was brought to the West by the French, this compact little book is widely regarded as the oldest military treatise in the world. Rumored to have been used by Napoleon in his campaigns to conquer Europe, it today retains much of its original merit. American officers read it closely during World War II. The Japanese army studied the work for decades, and many 20th-century Chinese officers are said to have known the book by heart. More recently, it has also been viewed as a valuable guide to competing successfully in business.<br />Stressing the importance of attacking your enemy when he is unprepared and scheming to discover his plans, the author advises avoiding the strong and striking at the weak, and using spies for every kind of business. Principles of strategy, tactics, maneuvering, and communications, the treatment of soldiers, the importance of strong troops and well-trained officers, and the administration of rewards and punishments all have a modern ring to them.<br />A valuable guide to the conduct of war, this classic of military strategy is indispensable to military personnel, history enthusiasts, and anyone intrigued by competition and rivalry.",

Written not only for martial artists but for anyone who wants to apply the timeless principles of this text to their life, the book analyzes the process of struggle and mastery over conflict that underlies every level of human interaction. <br /><br /><i>The Book of Five Rings</i> was composed in 1643 by the famed duelist and undefeated samurai Miyamoto Musashi. Thomas Cleary's translation is immediately accessible, with an introduction that presents the spiritual background of the warrior tradition. Along with Musashi's text, Cleary translates here another important Japanese classic on leadership and strategy, <i>The Book of Family Traditions on the Art of War</i> by Yagyu Munenori, which highlights the ethical and spiritual insights of Taoism and Zen as they apply to the way of the warrior.",

Sprawl is hard to pin down and the terms change every day. This concise book defines the vocabulary of sprawl from alligator to zoomburb, illustrating fifty-one colorful terms invented by real estate developers and designers to characterize contemporary building patterns. Sixty-nine aerial photographs, each paired with a definition, convey the impact of development and provide verbal and visual vocabulary needed by professionals, public officials, and citizens to critique uncontrolled growth in the American landscape. This \"devil's dictionary\" of American building accompanies a critique of metropolitan regions organized around unsustainable growth, where sprawling new areas of automobile-oriented construction flourish as older neighborhoods are left to decline.",

    "description": "The Development of an Extraordinary Species<br /><br />We human beings share 98 percent of our genes with chimpanzees. Yet humans are the dominant species on the planet -- having founded civilizations and religions, developed intricate and diverse forms of communication, learned science, built cities, and created breathtaking works of art -- while chimps remain animals concerned primarily with the basic necessities of survival. What is it about that two percent difference in DNA that has created such a divergence between evolutionary cousins? In this fascinating, provocative, passionate, funny, endlessly entertaining work, renowned Pulitzer Prize\u0096winning author and scientist Jared Diamond explores how the extraordinary human animal, in a remarkably short time, developed the capacity to rule the world . . . and the means to irrevocably destroy it.",

His love of women, his fondness for drink, and his loathing for the country prove formidable obstacles on his road to any kind of success. But when he becomes an operative in Operation Kingpin and is charged with monitoring the front runner in Kinjanja\u2019s national elections, Morgan senses an opportunity to achieve real professional recognition and, more importantly, reassignment.<br /><br />After he finds himself being blackmailed, diagnosed with a venereal disease, attempting bribery, and confounded with a dead body, Morgan realizes that very little is going according to plan.",

    "description": "First published in 1952 and immediately hailed as a masterpiece, <i>Invisible Man</i> is one of those rare novels that have changed the shape of American literature. For not only does Ralph Ellison's nightmare journey across the racial divide tell unparalleled truths about the nature of bigotry and its effects on the minds of both victims and perpetrators, it gives us an entirely new model of what a novel can be.<br /><br />As he journeys from the Deep South to the streets and basements of Harlem, from a horrifying \"battle royal\" where black men are reduced to fighting animals, to a Communist rally where they are elevated to the status of trophies, Ralph Ellison's nameless protagonist ushers readers into a parallel universe that throws our own into harsh and even hilarious relief. Suspenseful and sardonic, narrated in a voice that takes in the symphonic range of the American language, black and white, <i>Invisible Man</i> is one of the most audacious and dazzling novels of our century.",

    "description": "<b>Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time</b><br /><br />Set amid the splendor of London drawing rooms and gilded Venetian palazzos, <b>The Wings of the Dove</b> is the story of Milly Theale, a na\u00efve, doomed American heiress, and a pair of lovers, Kate Croy and Merton Densher, who conspire to obtain her fortune. In this witty tragedy of treachery, self-deception, and betrayal, Henry James weaves together three ill-fated and wholly human destinies unexpectedly linked by desire, greed, and salvation. As Amy Bloom writes in her Introduction, \u201c<b>The Wings of the Dove</b> is a novel of intimacy. . . . [James] gives us passion, he gives us love in its terrible and enchanting forms.\u201d",

It is a startlingly original first work by Japan's brightest young literary star and is now a cult film.<br /><br />When <b>Kitchen</b> was first published in Japan in 1987 it won two of Japan's most prestigious literary prizes, climbed its way to the top of the bestseller lists, then remained there for over a year and sold millions of copies. Banana Yoshimoto was hailed as a young writer of great talent and great passion whose work has quickly earned a place among the best of modern literature, and has been described as 'the voice of young Japan' by the <i>Independent on Sunday</i>.",

He arrives in New York at a time of unprecedented plenty, in the highest hour of America\u2019s wealth and power, seeking to \u201cerase\u201d himself. But fury is all around him. An astonishing work of explosive energy, Fury is by turns a pitiless and pitch-black comedy, a love story of mesmerizing force, and a disturbing inquiry into the darkest side of human nature.<br /><br />\u201cRushdie\u2019s ideas\u2013about society, about culture, about politics\u2013are embedded in his stories and in the interlocking momentum with which he tells them. . . .

    "description": "The award-winning poet Anne Carson reinvents a genre in Autobiography of Red, a stunning work that is both a novel and a poem, both an unconventional re-creation of an ancient Greek myth and a wholly original coming-of-age story set in the present.<br /><br />Geryon, a young boy who is also a winged red monster, reveals the volcanic terrain of his fragile, tormented soul in an autobiography he begins at the age of five. As he grows older, Geryon escapes his abusive brother and affectionate but ineffectual mother, finding solace behind the lens of his camera and in the arms of a young man named Herakles, a cavalier drifter who leaves him at the peak of infatuation. When Herakles reappears years later, Geryon confronts again the pain of his desire and embarks on a journey that will unleash his creative imagination to its fullest extent. By turns whimsical and haunting, erudite and accessible, richly layered and deceptively simple, Autobiography of Red is a profoundly moving portrait of an artist coming to terms with the fantastic accident of who he is.<br /><br />\"A profound love story . . . sensuous and funny, poignant, musical and tender.\"--The New York Times Book Review<br /><br />\"A deeply odd and immensely engaging book. . . . [Carson] exposes with passionate force the mythic underlying the explosive everyday.\"\u00a0\u00a0--The Village Voice<br /><br />A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF THE YEAR<br />National book Critics Circle Award Finalist",

    "description": "<b>The Barnes &amp; Noble Review</b><br />In the classical world, the muses -- all nine of them -- were daughters of Zeus who inspired poets, musicians, and other creative types to produce works of genius. Today, says Francine Prose, the word has been weakened and is used almost exclusively to refer to the chic women who help fashion designers inform their latest lines. But in her scholarly account, Prose (a National Book Award finalist for her novel <a href=\"http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?isbn=0060953713\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n  <i>Blue Angel</i>\n</a>) presents nine real women who moved men to greatness and who were not mere catalysts but worthy of note on their own, in many cases deserving a share of the credit for the work they helped create.<p><br /><br />Each chapter is a mini-biography of a woman's life and the way a male artist figured into it. We see the muse as prompter and creator in her own regard, like memoirist Hester Thrale, whose letters to Samuel Johnson helped form his later works. In Alice Liddell, the inspiration for Lewis Carroll's <a href=\"http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?isbn=0688110878\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i></a>, the muse is at her most passive, asserting her independence of the child-loving author only by failing to remain seven years old forever. And with Yoko Ono, there is the muse as artist in her own right, who claimed not to have heard of the Beatles before meeting John Lennon, and whose avant-garde tendencies some blamed for his musical downfall.</p><p><br /><br />To hit the mystical nine, Prose stretches a bit. For every Suzanne Farrell collaborating on ballets with George Balanchine, or every Gala Dal\ufffd cosigning canvases with spouse Salvador, there are personae only a graduate student would be likely to know. We learn of \"serial muse\" Lou Andreas-Salom\ufffd's involvement with Friedrich Nietzsche, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Sigmund Freud, and of how Charis Weston had to vie with a toilet for the attentions of her photographer husband, Edward. But these lesser-knowns help make the book a complete analysis of notable women who motivated men of achievement -- usually at the expense of their own -- and lived with the consequences. iKatherine Hottinger/i</p>",

But what is Maslow to make of this rough-looking stranger who claims to have read Maslow's books, who has Waffen-SS tattoos under his shirtsleeves, and who says that his mission is to save guys like him from becoming guys like him?<br /><br />As he gradually turns into the sort of person who might actually be able to do that, Vincent also transforms those around him: Maslow, who fears that heroism has become a desk job; Bonnie Kalen, the foundation's fund-raiser, a divorced single mother and a devoted believer in Maslow's crusade against intolerance and injustice; and Bonnie's teenage son, Danny, whose take on the world around him is at once openhearted, sharp-eyed, and as fundamentally decent as his mother's.<br /><br />Masterfully plotted, darkly comic, <strong>A Changed Man</strong> illuminates the everyday transactions in our lives, exposing what remains invisible in plain sight in our drug-addled and media-driven culture. Remarkable for the author's tender sympathy for her characters, <strong>A Changed Man</strong> poses the essential questions: What constitutes a life worth living? Is it possible to change? What does it mean to be a moral human being? The fearless intelligence, wit, and humanity that inform this novel make it Francine Prose's most accomplished yet.",

    "description": "<b>The Farming of Bones</b> begins in 1937 in a village on the Dominican side of the river that separates the country from Haiti. Amabelle Desir, Haitian-born and a faithful maidservant to the Dominican family that took her in when she was orphaned, and her lover Sebastien, an itinerant sugarcane cutter, decide they will marry and return to Haiti at the end of the cane season. However, hostilities toward Haitian laborers find a vitriolic spokesman in the ultra-nationalist Generalissimo Trujillo who calls for an ethnic cleansing of his Spanish-speaking country. As rumors of Haitian persecution become fact, as anxiety turns to terror, Amabelle and Sebastien's dreams are leveled to the most basic human desire: to endure. Based on a little-known historical event, this extraordinarily moving novel memorializes the forgotten victims of nationalist madness and the deeply felt passion and grief of its survivors.",

    "description": "As the day for Lincoln's second inauguration drew near, Americans wondered what their sixteenth president would say about the Civil War. Would Lincoln guide the nation toward \"Reconstruction\"? What about the slaves? They had been emancipated, but what about the matter of suffrage? When Lincoln finally stood before his fellow countrymen on March 4, 1865, and had only 703 words to share, the American public was stunned. The President had not offered the North a victory speech, nor did he excoriate the South for the sin of slavery. Instead, he called the whole country guilty of the sin and pleaded for reconciliation and unity.In this compelling account, noted historian Ronald C. White Jr. shows how Lincoln's speech was initially greeted with confusion and hostility by many in the Union; commended by the legions of African Americans in attendance, abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass among them; and ultimately appropriated by his assassin John Wilkes Booth forty-one days later.<br /><br />Filled with all the facts and factors surrounding the Second Inaugural, \"Lincoln's Greatest Speech\" is both an important historical document and a thoughtful analysis of Lincoln's moral and rhetorical genius.",

    "description": "<b>A gripping and page-turning thriller that explores themes of power, information, secrecy and war in the twentieth century. From the author of the three-volume historical epic 'The Baroque Cycle' and <i>Seveneves</i>.</b><br /><br />In his legendary, sprawling masterpiece, Neal Stephenson hacks into the secret histories of nations and the private obsessions of men, decrypting with dazzling virtuosity the forces that shaped this century.<br /><br />In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - a mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy - is assigned to Detachment 2702, an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists. Some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt.<br /><br />Their mission is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy's fabled Enigma code. Waterhouse is flung into a cryptographic chess match against his German counterpart - one where every move determines the fate of thousands.<br /><br />In the present day, Waterhouse's crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a \"data haven\" in Southeast Asia where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. Joining forces with the tough-as-nails Amy, Randy attempts tosecretly salvage a sunken Nazi submarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat.<br /><br />But their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 - and an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. There are two ways this could go: towards unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty - or towards a totalitarian nightmare...<br /><br />Profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyperactive, <i>Cryptonomicon</i> is a work of great art, thought and creative daring, the product of a ingenious imagination working with white-hot intensity.",

    "description": "After living in Britain for two decades, Bill Bryson recently moved back to the United States with his English wife and four children (he had read somewhere that nearly 3 million Americans believed they had been abducted by aliens--as he later put it, \"it was clear my people needed me\"). They were greeted by a new and improved America that boasts microwave pancakes, twenty-four-hour dental-floss hotlines, and the staunch conviction that ice is not a luxury item. <br /><br />Delivering the brilliant comic musings that are a Bryson hallmark, I'm a Stranger Here Myself recounts his sometimes disconcerting reunion with the land of his birth. The result is a book filled with hysterical scenes of one man's attempt to reacquaint himself with his own country, but it is also an extended if at times bemused love letter to the homeland he has returned to after twenty years away.",

    "description": "Nobel Prize-winning author Rudyard Kipling set his final and most famous novel in the complex, mystery-shrouded India of the mid-19th century where an exotic landscape teems with natives living under British colonial rule. <br />Kim, the poor orphaned son of an Irish soldier stationed in Lahore, straddles both worlds. Neither wholly British nor completely Indian, the young boy searches for his identity in the country where he was born; but at the same time, he struggles to create an identity for himself. Cunning and street wise, Kim is mature beyond his thirteen years and learns to move chameleon-like between the two cultures, becoming the disciple of a Tibetan monk while training as a spy for the British secret service.<br />Far above the average adventure story, Kim will captivate Kipling devotees as well as fans of tales brimming with foreign intrigue and treachery.",

    "description": "<br /><b>In the glossy private world of Fifth Avenue teens, some millionaire parents will do, pay, or say anything to help their children ace the SATs.</b> <p> Noah rose from humble beginnings and, through pure grit and resourcefulness, got himself through Princeton. Now staggering under the weight of massive student loans and dazzled by life in the big city, Noah enters the rarefied field of SAT tutoring in Manhattan, working one-on-one with the spoiled, gorgeous children of the American aristocracy. </p><p> He takes on the considerable academic challenges that are Dylan Thayer, a dissipated high school athlete-socialite, and his waifish sister Tuscany. Dylan won't lift a finger to do anything but pick up a lacrosse stick, and Tuscany is avidly pursuing her own downfall via drugs and relationships with men more than twice her age. But their mother, a self-medicating pediatrician, has ambitious plans for them in spite of their shortcomings -- and she has plans for their SAT tutor as well. </p><p> Trying to build his own life while living on a shoestring in Harlem and flirting with his beautiful roommate keeps Noah busy enough, but the needs of the glamorous, struggling Thayer kids and the inappropriate advances of their mother prove all-consuming. As deadlines for college admissions near and the SAT tension builds, Noah finds himself presented with a Faustian bargain, and he must make a moral decision that will affect him and his students for years to come. </p><p> With echoes of <i>The Devil Wears Prada, The Nanny Diaries</i>, and <i>Bright Lights, Big City, Glamorous Disasters</i> is an incisive portrayal of a small and privileged world, a cautionary tale written by a Harvard grad who was once an SAT tutor himself -- an outsider who became a magnificently observant insider.<br /></p>",

As she deftly and delicately exposes the cruelty that lurks behind the polished surfaces of conventional society, Bowen reveals herself as a masterful novelist who combines a sense of humor with a devastating gift for divining human motivations.<br /><br />In this piercing story of innocence betrayed set in the thirties, the orphaned Portia is stranded in the sophisticated and politely treacherous world of her wealthy half-brother's home in London. There she encounters the attractive, carefree cad Eddie. To him, Portia is at once child and woman, and he fears her gushing love. To her, Eddie is the only reason to be alive. But when Eddie follows Portia to a sea-side resort, the flash of a cigarette lighter in a darkened cinema illuminates a stunning romantic betrayal\u2014and sets in motion one of the most moving and desperate flights of the heart in modern literature.",

    "description": "Heavy-built Jack Burdette is quite literally too big for his boots - and too big, certainly for the small-town attitudes of Holt, Colorado. But when he fails to make the grade as a college footballer, and takes a job with the local farmers' co-operative, it seems he has finally settled into the rhythm and routine of everyday life. Outward appearances can be deceptive, however, as Jack proves: returning from a weekend conference with a new wife in tow, then leaving her behind and skipping town with a bundle of other folk's money.<br /><br />Nearly a decade later, no one has forgiven or forgotten, and when Jack reappears, resentment runs high. Once again though, it is Jack whose presence - even more than his eight-year absence - proves the most devastating.",

    "description": "Jane Austen's first novel\u2014published posthumously in 1818\u2014tells the story of Catherine Morland and her dangerously sweet nature, innocence, and sometime self-delusion. Though Austen's fallible heroine is repeatedly drawn into scrapes while vacationing at Bath and during her subsequent visit to Northanger Abbey, Catherine eventually triumphs, blossoming into a discerning woman who learns truths about love, life, and the heady power of literature. The satirical novel pokes fun at the gothic novel while earnestly emphasizing caution to the female sex.",

    "description": "<b>\n  <i>Fourteen of F. Scott Fitzgerald's best-loved and most beguiling stories, together in a single volume</i>\n</b> <br /> In 1928, while struggling with his novel <i>Tender Is the Night,</i> Fitzgerald began writing a series of stories about Basil Duke Lee, a fictionalized version of his younger self. Drawing on his childhood and adolescent experiences, Fitzgerald wrote nine tales that were published in the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> about his life from the time he was an eleven-year-old boy living in Buffalo, New York, until he entered Princeton University in 1913. Then from 1930 to 1931, with <i>Tender Is the Night</i> still unfinished, Fitzgerald wrote five more stories (also published in the <i>Post)</i> that centered around Josephine Perry, Basil's female counterpart. Although Fitzgerald intended to combine the fourteen Basil Lee and Josephine Perry stories into a single work, he never succeeded in doing so in his lifetime. Here, <i>The Basil and Josephine Stories</i> brings together in one volume the complete set, resulting in one of Fitzgerald's most charming and evocative works.",

    "description": "This is the most comprehensive anthology of Soren Kierkegaard's works ever assembled in English. Drawn from the volumes of Princeton's authoritative <i>Kierkegaard's Writings</i> series by editors Howard and Edna Hong, the selections represent every major aspect of Kierkegaard's extraordinary career. They reveal the powerful mix of philosophy, psychology, theology, and literary criticism that made Kierkegaard one of the most compelling writers of the nineteenth century and a shaping force in the twentieth. With an introduction to Kierkegaard's writings as a whole and explanatory notes for each selection, this is the essential one-volume guide to a thinker who changed the course of modern intellectual history.<br /><br /><br />The anthology begins with Kierkegaard's early journal entries and traces the development of his work chronologically to the final <i>The Changelessness of God</i>. The book presents generous selections from all of Kierkegaard's landmark works, including <i>Either/Or, Fear and Trembling, Works of Love</i>, and <i>The Sickness unto Death</i>, and draws new attention to a host of such lesser-known writings as <i>Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions</i> and <i>The Lily of the Field and the Bird of the Air</i>. The selections are carefully chosen to reflect the unique character of Kierkegaard's work, with its shifting pseudonyms, its complex dialogues, and its potent combination of irony, satire, sermon, polemic, humor, and fiction. We see the esthetic, ethical, and ethical-religious ways of life initially presented as dialogue in two parallel series of pseudonymous and signed works and later in the \"second authorship\" as direct address. And we see the themes that bind the whole together, in particular Kierkegaard's overarching concern with, in his own words, \"What it means to exist; . . . what it means to be a human being.?<br /><br /><br />Together, the selections provide the best available introduction to Kierkegaard's writings and show more completely than any other book why his work, in all its creativity, variety, and power, continues to speak so directly today to so many readers around the world.",

    "description": "From the fall of Rome to the rise of Charlemagne - the \"dark ages\" - learning, scholarship, and culture disappeared from the European continent. The great heritage of western civilization - from the Greek and Roman classics to Jewish and Christian works - would have been utterly lost were it not for the holy men and women of unconquered Ireland. <br /><br />In this delightful and illuminating look into a crucial but little-known \"hinge\" of history, Thomas Cahill takes us to the \"island of saints and scholars, \" the Ireland of St. Patrick and the Book of Kells. Here, far from the barbarian despoliation of the continent, monks and scribes laboriously, lovingly, even playfully preserved the west's written treasures. With the return of stability in Europe, these Irish scholars were instrumental in spreading learning. Thus the Irish not only were conservators of civilization, but became shapers of the medieval mind, putting their unique stamp on western culture.",

And surely this is, often enough, an adequate description. But history is also the narratives of grace, the recountings of those blessed and inexplicable moments when someone did something for someone else, saved a life, bestowed a gift, gave something beyond what was required by circumstance. - Thomas Cahill",

    "description": "Imagine beetles ejecting defensive sprays as hot as boiling water; female moths holding their mates for ransom; caterpillars disguising themselves as flowers by fastening petals to their bodies; termites emitting a viscous glue to rally fellow soldiers--and you will have entered an insect world once beyond imagining, a world observed and described down to its tiniest astonishing detail by Thomas Eisner. The story of a lifetime of such minute explorations, <i>For Love of Insects</i> celebrates the small creatures that have emerged triumphant on the planet, the beneficiaries of extraordinary evolutionary inventiveness and unparalleled reproductive capacity.<br /><br />To understand the success of insects is to appreciate our own shortcomings, Eisner tells us, but never has a reckoning been such a pleasure. Recounting exploits and discoveries in his lab at Cornell and in the field in Uruguay, Australia, Panama, Europe, and North America, Eisner time and again demonstrates how inquiry into the survival strategies of an insect leads to clarifications beyond the expected; insects are revealed as masters of achievement, forms of life worthy of study and respect from even the most recalcitrant entomophobe. Filled with descriptions of his ingenious experiments and illustrated with photographs unmatched for their combination of scientific content and delicate beauty, Eisner's book makes readers participants in the grand adventure of discovery on a scale infinitesimally small, and infinitely surprising.",

    "description": "In spring 2002, following the fall of the Taliban, \u00c5sne Seierstad spent four months living with a bookseller and his family in Kabul.<br /><br />For more than twenty years Sultan Khan defied the authorities\u2014be they communist or Taliban\u2014to supply books to the people of Kabul. He was arrested, interrogated and imprisoned by the communists, and watched illiterate Taliban soldiers burn piles of his books in the street. He even resorted to hiding most of his stock\u2014almost ten thousand books\u2014in attics all over Kabul.<br /><br />But while Khan is passionate in his love of books and his hatred of censorship, he also has strict views on family life and the role of women. As an outsider, \u00c5sne Seierstad found herself in a unique position, able to move freely between the private, restricted sphere of the women\u2014including Khan\u2019s two wives\u2014and the freer, more public lives of the men.<br /><br />It is an experience that Seierstad finds both fascinating and frustrating. As she steps back from the page and allows the Khans to speak for themselves, we learn of proposals and marriages, hope and fear, crime and punishment. The result is a genuinely gripping and moving portrait of a family, and a clear-eyed assessment of a country struggling to free itself from history.' to 'This mesmerizing portrait of a proud man who, through three decades and successive repressive regimes, heroically braved persecution to bring books to the people of Kabul has elicited extraordinary praise throughout the world and become a phenomenal international bestseller. <i>The Bookseller of Kabul</i> is startling in its intimacy and its details\u2014a revelation of the plight of Afghan women and a window into the surprising realities of daily life in today\u2019s Afghanistan.'",

Kinsella's trademark combination of \"sweet-natured prose and a richly imagined world\" (Philadelphia Inquirer), The Iowa Baseball Confederacy tells the story of Gideon Clark, a man on a quest. He is out to prove to the world that the indomitable Chicago Cubs traveled to Iowa in the summer of 1908 for an exhibition game against an amateur league, the Iowa Baseball Confederacy. But a simple game somehow turned into a titanic battle of more than two thousand innings, and Gideon Clark struggles to set the record straight on this infamous game that no one else believes ever happened.",

    "description": "On a wintry night in February 1989, 22-year-old Deborah Copaken Kogan is the lone female among a group of Afghan freedom fighters riding through the Hindu Kush mountains. 'In my lap, hopping atop my thighs as the truck lurches, as my body shivers, sits a sturdy canvas Domke bag filled with Nikons and Kodachrome film, which I'm hoping to use to photograph the pull-out of the Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Actually, I have no idea how to photograph a Soviet pull-out. Though this is my second story as a professional photojournalist, I'm still not clear on what it is photojournalists actually do in a real war.' What follows is the hilarious and winning memoir of a young woman finding and fighting her way through the war zones of the world. It is a thrilling coming-of-age story, told with humour and uncommon wisdom, about how one woman fought her way on to battlefields, and the danger, pain, truths and love she discovered there.",

    "description": "THINGS FALL APART tells two overlapping, intertwining stories, both of which center around Okonkwo, a \u201cstrong man\u201d of an Ibo village in Nigeria. The first of these stories traces Okonkwo's fall from grace with the tribal world in which he lives, and in its classical purity of line and economical beauty it provides us with a powerful fable about the immemorial conflict between the individual and society. <br /><br />The second story, which is as modern as the first is ancient, and which elevates the book to a tragic plane, concerns the clash of cultures and the destruction of Okonkwo's world through the arrival of aggressive, proselytizing European missionaries. These twin dramas are perfectly harmonized, and they are modulated by an awareness capable of encompassing at once the life of nature, human history, and the mysterious compulsions of the soul. THINGS FALL APART is the most illuminating and permanent monument we have to the modern African experience as seen from within.",

An exhilarating tale of legend and heroism, <i>Streets of Laredo</i> is classic Texas and Western literature at its finest.<br /><br />Captain Woodrow Call, August McCrae's old partner, is now a bounty hunter hired to track down a brutal young Mexican bandit.

This one is personal...because the murdered man was a fellow Vietnam \"tunnel rat\" who had fought side by side with him in a hellish underground war. Now Bosch is about to relive the horror of Nam. From a dangerous maze of blind alleys to a daring criminal heist beneath the city, his survival instincts will once again be tested to their limit.

National bestseller.<br /></div><br /><br />When King and Church exercise absolute power what happens to the dreams of ordinary people? In early eighteenth century Lisbon, Baltasar, a soldier who has lost a hand in battle, falls in love with Blimunda, a young girl with visionary powers. From the day that he follows her home from the auto-da-fe where her mother is condemned and burned at the stake, the two are bound body and soul by a love of unassailable strength. A third party shares their supper that evening: Pardere Bartolemeu Lourenco, whose fantasy is to invent a flying machine. As the inquisition rages and royalty and religion clash, they pursue his impossible, not to mention heretical, dream of flight.",

A household name as the host of <i>Rise and Shine</i>, the country\u2019s highest-rated morning talk show, Meghan cuts to a commercial break\u2013but not before she mutters two forbidden words into her open mike. <br /><br />In an instant, it\u2019s the end of an era, not only for Meghan, who is unaccustomed to dealing with adversity, but also for her younger sister, Bridget, a social worker in the Bronx who has always lived in Meghan\u2019s long shadow. The effect of Meghan\u2019s on-air truth telling reverberates through both their lives, affecting Meghan\u2019s son, husband, friends, and fans, as well as Bridget\u2019s perception of her sister, their complex childhood, and herself. What follows is a story about how, in very different ways, the Fitzmaurice women adapt, survive, and manage to bring the whole teeming world of New York to heel by dint of their smart mouths, quick wits, and the powerful connection between them that even the worst tragedy cannot shatter.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "<b> \"An insightful, dramatic and emotional tale that deserves a place alongside Dennis Smith's classic firefighting memoir, Report from Engine Co. 82.\" -Terry Golway, New York Post</b><br /><br />Brooklyn's Rescue 2 has long been known as one of the country's top firehouses, a model for departments nationwide. Recognized for their expertise and commitment, Rescue 2's men handle only big blazes where civilians and their fellow firemen are in danger.<br /><br />Beginning in 1996 with legendary Captain Ray Downey's promotion, the story follows the trials of his replacement, Phil Ruvolo, as he works to win over his headstrong men. A new Rescue 2 is forged through changes in firefighting methods and blazes that quickly become legend. Through the crisis of 9/11 and the subsequent rebuilding, Ruvolo triumphantly fills the late Downey's boots, heading Rescue 2 toward a future worthy of its past, its heroes, its city.<br /><br />Filled with firefighting detail, raucous humor, and gritty real-life scenes, <i>The Last Men Out</i> is a new classic for an era in firefighting that is more risky, complicated, and dramatic than any before.",

    "description": "Steve Silverman was looking for a way to add some spice to his high school lectures when he realized that weird and bizarre true-life stories would capture his students' attention. In fact, they worked so well that the science teacher then began posting his discoveries to his own Web site, which he dubbed <i>Useless Information</i>. Well-researched and clearly sourced, Silverman's unusual tidbits have gained a wide following.<br /><br />In <i>Einstein's Refrigerator</i>, Silverman collects more than 30 of the most fascinating stories he has gathered--tales of forgotten genius, great blunders, and incredible feats of survival, as well as answers to puzzling questions.<br /><br /><i>Einstein's Refrigerator</i> is a remarkable book with spellbinding stories. Whatever happened to the refrigerator Einstein helped invent? While it never became a commercial success, its underlying concepts became the basis for cooling nuclear breeder reactors.",

    "description": "Dramatically recolors the personality and accomplishment of a mythic figure whose seventeenth-century clash with Catholic doctrine continues to define the schism between science and religion.<br /><br />Inspired by a long fascination with Galileo, and by the remarkable surviving letters of Galileo's daughter, a cloistered nun, Dava Sobel has written a biography unlike any other of the man Albert Einstein called \"the father of modern physics--indeed of modern science altogether.\" Galileo's Daughter also presents a stunning portrait of a person hitherto lost to history, described by her father as \"a woman of exquisite mind, singular goodness, and most tenderly attached to me.\" <br /><br />The son of a musician, Galileo Gahlei (1564-1642) tried at first to enter a monastery before engaging the skills that made him the foremost scientist of his day. Though he never left Italy, his inventions and discoveries were heralded around the world. Most sensationally, his telescopes allowed him to reveal a new reality in the heavens and to reinforce the astounding argument that the Earth moves around the Sun. For this belief, he was brought before the Holy Office of the Inquisition, accused of heresy, and forced to spend his last years under house arrest. <br /><br />Of Galileo's three illegitimate children, the eldest best mirrored his own brilliance, industry, and sensibility, and by virtue of these qualities became his confidante. Born Virginia in 1600, she was thirteen when Galileo placed her in a convent near him in Florence, where she took the most appropriate name of Suor Maria Celeste. Her loving support, which Galileo repaid in kind, proved to be her father's greatest source of strength throughout his most productive and tumultuous years. Her presence, through letters which Sobel has translated from their original Italian and masterfully woven into the narrative, graces her father's life now as it did then. <br /><br />Galileo's Daughter dramatically recolors the personality and accomplishment of a mythic figure whose seventeenth-century clash with Catholic doctrine continues to define the schism between science and religion. Moving between Galileo's grand public life and Maria Celeste's sequestered world, Sobel illuminates the Florence of the Medicis and the papal court in Rome during the pivotal era when humanity's perception of its place in the cosmos was being overturned. In that same time, while the bubonic plague wreaked its terrible devastation and the Thirty Years' War tipped fortunes across Europe, one man sought to reconcile the Heaven he revered as a good Catholic with the heavens he revealed through his telescope. <br /><br />With all the human drama and scientific adventure that distinguished Longitude, Galileo's Daughter is an unforgettable story.",

    "description": "Jerri Nielsen was a forty-six-year-old doctor working in Ohio when she made the decision to take a year's sabbatical at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station on Antarctica, the most remote and perilous place on Earth. The \"Polies,\" as they are known, live in almost total darkness for six months of the year, in winter temperatures as low as 100 degrees below zero--with no way in or out before the spring.During the long winter of 1999, Dr. Nielsen, solely responsible for the mental and physical fitness of a team of researchers, construction workers, and support staff, discovered a lump in her breast. Consulting via email with doctors in the United States, she performed a biopsy on herself, and in July began chemotherapy treatments to ensure her survival until condition permitted her rescue in October. A daring rescue by the Air National Guard ensued, who landed, dropped off a replacement physician, and minutes later took off with Dr. Nielsen.<br /><br />This is Dr. Nielsen's own account of her experience at the Pole, the sea change as she becomes \"of the Ice,\" and her realization that as she would rather be on Antarctica than anywhere else on earth. It is also a thrilling adventure of researchers and scientists embattled by a hostile environment; a penetrating exploration of the dynamics of an isolated, intensely connected community faced with adversity; and, at its core, a powerfully moving drama of love and loss, of one woman's voyage of self-discovery through an extraordinary struggle for survival.",

Half a century later, one of the missing diamonds has reappeared... and the wolves are on the scent.</i><br /><br />Former Navajo Tribal Police Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn is coming out of retirement to help exonerate a slow, simple kid accused of robbing a trade post. Billy Tuve claims he received the diamond he tried to pawn from a mysterious old man in the canyon, and his story has attracted the dangerous attention of strangers to the Navajo lands - one more interested in a severed limb than the fortune it was attached to; another willing to murder to keep lost secrets hidden. But nature herself may prove the deadliest adversary, as Leaphorn and Sergeant Jim Chee follow a puzzle - and a killer - down into the dark realm of Skeleton Man.",

Now, in <i>Life Is Short\u2014Wear Your Party Pants, </i>she gives you the tools you need to not only <i>reduce </i>feelings of tension, but also to bring joy, passion, and gusto into your life. Her techniques are a brilliant blend of old-world common sense and the most contemporary research in brain chemistry, psychology, and mind-body studies. Loretta gives you dozens of proven techniques for recognizing the ten simple truths that will lead you to an intense, happy, successful life: <i>resilience, living in the moment, optimism, acceptance, humor, creativity, moderation, responsibility, meaning, </i>and <i>connection.</i><br /><br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Loretta\u2019s wisdom evolved from her own life\u2014one filled with the demands of being a single mother of three; of starting her own business when she was broke; and of the wacky invasiveness of her Italian family. She\u2019s like all of us: real, flawed, stressed out, and on edge. Her magic comes from an ability to not take herself too seriously, and to always shift her focus <i>away </i>from the self-destructive and <i>toward </i>the truly important things in life.<br /><br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In her work, Loretta has seen tens of thousands of people who live their lives as if they\u2019re sitting in a waiting room, hoping that their turn comes up next. This book will show you that life is not something to be <i>endured, </i>but is something to be truly appreciated. We need to remember how to access our inner abundance, which allows us to be heart-centered, joy-filled human beings.<br /><br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As Loretta says: <i>\u201cYesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, and today is a gift\u2014that\u2019s why they call it the present.\u201d </i>",

So no one is terribly upset when he's fatally mashed by a falling rock of hams at the new deli where suburban single mom Jane Jeffry's son works part-time.<br /><br />But when Stonecipher's most obnoxious employee meets an equally appropriate end, Jane knows the fat's really in the fire. And though her homicide detective honey Mel VanDyne disapproves, Jane is determined to dive headfirst into this deadly daze of swine and neuroses -- and hunt a hog-wild murderer despite her own killer agenda as homemaker/PTA/church/community busyperson.",

    "description": "<div>The historical record crowns success. Those enshrined in its annals are men and women whose ideas, accomplishments, or personalities have dominated, endured, and most important of all, found champions. John F. Kennedy's <i>Profiles in Courage</i>, Giorgio Vasari's <i>Lives of the Artists</i>, and Samuel Johnson's <i>Lives of the Poets</i> are classic celebrations of the greatest, the brightest, the eternally constellated.<br /><br />Paul Collins' <i>Banvard's Folly</i> is a different kind of book. Here are thirteen unforgettable portraits of forgotten people: men and women who might have claimed their share of renown but who, whether from ill timing, skullduggery, monomania, the tinge of madness, or plain bad luck-or perhaps some combination of them all-leapt straight from life into thankless obscurity. Among their number are scientists, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, and adventurers, from across the centuries and around the world. They hold in common the silenced aftermath of failure, the name that rings no bells.<br /><br />Collins brings them back to glorious life. John Banvard was an artist whose colossal panoramic canvasses (one behemoth depiction of the entire eastern shore of the Mississippi River was simply known as \"The Three Mile Painting\") made him the richest and most famous artist of his day. . . before he decided to go head to head with P. T. Barnum. Ren\u00e9 Blondot was a distinguished French physicist whose celebrated discovery of a new form of radiation, called the N-Ray, went terribly awry. At the tender age of seventeen, William Henry Ireland signed \"William Shakespeare\" to a book and launched a short but meteoric career as a forger of undiscovered works by the Bard -- until he pushed his luck too far. John Symmes, a hero of the War of 1812, nearly succeeded in convincing Congress to fund an expedition to the North Pole, where he intended to prove his theory that the earth was hollow and ripe for exploitation; his quixotic quest counted Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe among its greatest admirers.<br /><br />Collins' love for what he calls the \"forgotten ephemera of genius\" give his portraits of these figures and the other nine men and women in <i>Banvard's Folly</i> sympathetic depth and poignant relevance. Their effect is not to make us sneer or revel in schadenfreude; here are no cautionary tales. Rather, here are brief introductions-acts of excavation and reclamation-to people whom history may have forgotten, but whom now we cannot.<br /></div>",

    "description": "<div>A daring, deeply affecting third novel by the author of <i>A Home at the End of the World </i>and <i>Flesh and Blood</i>. <br /><br />In <i>The Hours</i>, Michael Cunningham, widely praised as one of the most gifted writers of his generation, draws inventively on the life and work of Virginia Woolf to tell the story of a group of contemporary characters struggling with the conflicting claims of love and inheritance, hope and despair. The narrative of Woolf's last days before her suicide early in World War II counterpoints the fictional stories of Samuel, a famous poet whose life has been shadowed by his talented and troubled mother, and his lifelong friend Clarissa, who strives to forge a balanced and rewarding life in spite of the demands of friends, lovers, and family. <br /><br />Passionate, profound, and deeply moving, this is Cunningham's most remarkable achievement to date. <br /></div>",

    "description": "From an award-winning New York Times investigative reporter comes an outrageous story of greed, corruption, and conspiracy\u2014which left the FBI and Justice Department counting on the cooperation of one man . . .<br /><br />It was one of the FBI's biggest secrets: a senior executive with America's most politically powerful corporation, Archer Daniels Midland, had become a confidential government witness, secretly recording a vast criminal conspiracy spanning five continents. Mark Whitacre, the promising golden boy of ADM, had put his career and family at risk to wear a wire and deceive his friends and colleagues. Using Whitacre and a small team of agents to tap into the secrets at ADM, the FBI discovered the company's scheme to steal millions of dollars from its own customers. <br /><br />But as the FBI and federal prosecutors closed in on ADM, using stakeouts, wiretaps, and secret recordings of illegal meetings around the world, they suddenly found that everything was not all that it appeared. At the same time Whitacre was cooperating with the Feds while playing the role of loyal company man, he had his own<br />agenda he kept hidden from everyone around him\u2014his wife, his lawyer, even the FBI agents who had come to trust him with the case they had put their careers on the line for. Whitacre became sucked into his own world of James Bond antics, imperiling the criminal case and creating a web of deceit that left the FBI and prosecutors uncertain where the lies stopped and the truth began.<br /><br />In this gripping account unfolds one of the most captivating and bizarre tales in the history of the FBI and corporate America. Meticulously researched and richly told by New York Times senior writer Kurt Eichenwald, <b>The Informant</b> re-creates the drama of the story, beginning with the secret recordings, stakeouts, and interviews with suspects and witnesses to the power struggles within ADM and its board\u2014including the high-profile chairman Dwayne Andreas, F. Ross Johnson, and Brian Mulroney\u2014to the big-gun Washington lawyers hired by ADM and on up through the ranks of the Justice Department to FBI Director Louis Freeh and Attorney General Janet Reno.<br /><br />A page-turning real-life thriller that features deadpan FBI agents, crooked executives, idealistic lawyers, and shady witnesses with an addiction to intrigue, <b>The Informant</b> tells an important and compelling story of power and betrayal in America",

    "description": "What happens when the most beautiful girl in the world marries the handsomest prince of all time and he turns out to be...well...a lot less than the man of her dreams?<br /><br />As a boy, William Goldman claims, he loved to hear his father read the S. Morgenstern classic, <i>The Princess Bride</i>. But as a grown-up he discovered that the boring parts were left out of good old Dad's recitation, and only the \"good parts\" reached his ears.<br /><br />Now Goldman does Dad one better. He's reconstructed the \"Good Parts Version\" to delight wise kids and wide-eyed grownups everywhere.<br /><br />What's it about? Fencing. Fighting. True Love. Strong Hate. Harsh Revenge. A Few Giants. Lots of Bad Men. Lots of Good Men. Five or Six Beautiful Women. Beasties Monstrous and Gentle. Some Swell Escapes and Captures. Death, Lies, Truth, Miracles, and a Little Sex.<br /><br />In short, it's about everything.",

    "description": "One unremarkable June morning, Alice Goodwin is, as usual, trying to keep in check both her temper and her tendency to blame herself for her family's shortcomings. When the Goodwins took over the last dairy farm in the small Midwestern town of Prairie Center, they envisioned their home a self-made paradise. But these days, as Alice is all too aware, her elder daughter Emma is prone to inexplicable fits of rage, her husband Howard distrusts her maternal competence, and Prairie Center's tight-knit suburban community shows no signs of warming to \"those hippies who think they can run a farm.\" <br /><br />A loner by nature, Alice is torn between a yearning for solitude coupled with a deep need to be at the center of a perfect family. On this particular day, Emma has started the morning with a violent tantrum, her little sister Claire is eating pennies, and it is Alice's turn to watch her neighbor's two small girls as well as her own. She absentmindedly steals a minute alone that quickly becomes ten: time enough for a devastating accident to occur. Her neighbor's daughter Lizzy drowns in the farm's pond, and Alice - whose own volatility and unmasked directness keep her on the outskirts of acceptance - becomes the perfect scapegoat. At the same time, a seemingly trivial incident from Alice's past resurfaces and takes on gigantic proportions, leading the Goodwins far from Lizzy's death into a maze of guilt and doubt culminating in a harrowing court trial and the family's shattering downfall.",

    "description": "Jon Krakauer\u2019s literary reputation rests on insightful chronicles of lives conducted at the outer limits. He now shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders, taking readers inside isolated American communities where some 40,000 Mormon Fundamentalists still practice polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the renegade leaders of these Taliban-like theocracies are zealots who answer only to God.<br /><br />At the core of Krakauer\u2019s book are brothers Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a commandment from God to kill a blameless woman and her baby girl. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this appalling double murder, Krakauer constructs a multi-layered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, polygamy, savage violence, and unyielding faith. Along the way he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America\u2019s fastest growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.",

It was immediately praised for its innovative narrative technique, and comparisons were made with Joyce and Dostoyevsky, but it did not receive popular acclaim until the late forties, shortly before Faulkner received the Nobel Prize for Literature.<br /> \u00a0<br /> The novel reveals the story of the disintegration of the Compson family, doomed inhabitants of Faulkner\u2019s mythical Yoknapatawpha County, through the interior monologues of the idiot Benjy and his brothers, Quentin and Jason. Featuring a new Foreword by Marilynne Robinson, this edition follows the text corrected in 1984 by Faulkner expert Noel Polk and corresponds as closely as possible to the author\u2019s original intentions. Included also is the Appendix that Faulkner wrote for <i>The Portable Faulkner</i> in 1946, which he called the \u201ckey to the whole book.\u201d",

    "description": "As private secretary to the Emperor Hadrian, Suetonius gained access to the imperial archives and used them (along with eye-witness accounts) to produce one of the most colorful biographical works in history. <i>The Twelve Caesars</i> chronicles the public careers and private lives of the men who wielded absolute power over Rome, from the foundation of the empire under Julius Caesar and Augustus, to the decline into depravity and civil war under Nero, and the recovery that came with his successors. A masterpiece of anecdote, wry observation and detailed physical description, <i>The Twelve Caesars</i> presents us with a gallery of vividly drawn \u2014 and all too human \u2014 individuals.<br /><br />Robert Graves's celebrated translation, sensitively revised by Michael Grant, captures all the wit and immediacy of Suetonius' original.",

    "description": "Most historians, both ancient and modern, have viewed the Late Republic of Rome through the eyes of its rich nobility. In <i>The Assassination of Julius Caesar</i>, Michael Parenti presents us with a story of popular resistance against entrenched power and wealth. As he carefully weighs the evidence concerning the murder of Caesar, Parenti sketches in the background to the crime with fascinating detail about wider Roman society. The result is an entirely new perspective on a much-studied era.",

    "description": "Many companies who claim to be selling products are really selling services. What used to be a product-driven economy is now replete with services. But unlike products, you can't touch services, hear or see them. Services are mainly just promises that somebody will do something. They are invisible. So how do you sell, develop and make them grow? This international bestseller, now in paperback, answers that question with insights on how the markets for services work and how customers think and behave towards your offering.

Tormented by eerie sensations and loss of memory, he doesn't know who he really is or exactly where he has come from. His destiny only begins to grow frighteningly clear when he meets a weird, tassel-eared creature who darkly hints at the truth about Blake's origins. Slowly Blake becomes aware of the long hushed-up \"Werewolf Principle,\" a scientific theory buried in the past, which holds the key to Blake's own fate-and the future of the human species.--book cover",

Halliday started out a repressed picky eater without so much as a single fast-food-loving sibling to save her from the gourmet ambitions of a mother whose recipe for Far East Celery once received favorable mention in the <i>Indianapolis Star.</i> Her palate has since expanded to the degree that she'll fork down anything from chili-smothered insects that pass for an exotic destination's local delicacies to a peanut found wedged between the cushions of a theater seat. <br />From summer camp's unlimited Pop-Tarts to the post-coital breakfasts of a well-traveled actress-waitress and the frustrating payback of cooking for some finicky offspring of the author's own, <i>Dirty Sugar Cookies</i> is an omnivorous, hilarious chronicle of culinary awakening.<br />",

Blackwood\u2019s ability to create and sustain an atmosphere of unrelieved horror is witnessed in \u2018The Willows\u2019, a starkly terrifying tale of another dimension impinging on our own. In contrast, \u2018The Other Wing\u2019, is a chilling but delicate evocation of the mysteries of childhood. Mysticism and cosmic experiences feature, as well as the more traditional elements of the horror story. Best Ghost Stories of Algernon Blackwood reveals why Blackwood is celebrated as the twentieth century\u2019s foremost British writer of supernatural fiction.",

    "description": "As far back as she can remember, Azadeh Moaveni has felt at odds with her tangled identity as an Iranian-American. In suburban America, Azadeh lived in two worlds. At home, she was the daughter of the Iranian exile community, serving tea, clinging to tradition, and dreaming of Tehran. Outside, she was a California girl who practiced yoga and listened to Madonna. For years, she ignored the tense standoff between her two cultures. But college magnified the clash between Iran and America, and after graduating, she moved to Iran as a journalist. This is the story of her search for identity, between two cultures cleaved apart by a violent history. It is also the story of Iran, a restive land lost in the twilight of its revolution. <br /> Moaveni's homecoming falls in the heady days of the country's reform movement, when young people demonstrated in the streets and shouted for the Islamic regime to end. In these tumultuous times, she struggles to build a life in a dark country, wholly unlike the luminous, saffron and turquoise-tinted Iran of her imagination. As she leads us through the drug-soaked, underground parties of Tehran, into the hedonistic lives of young people desperate for change, Moaveni paints a rare portrait of Iran's rebellious next generation. The landscape of her Tehran \u2014 ski slopes, fashion shows, malls and cafes \u2014 is populated by a cast of young people whose exuberance and despair brings the modern reality of Iran to vivid life.",

    "description": "<b>From the Hardcover</b><br /><br />\u201cWe stormed every classroom, inscribed our slogans on the blackboard . . . Never had mayhem brought more peace. All our lives we had been taught the virtues of behaving, and now we were discovering the importance of misbehaving. Too much fear had tainted our days. Too many afternoons had passed in silence, listening to a fanatic\u2019s diatribes. We were rebelling because we were not evil, we had not sinned, and we knew nothing of the apocalypse. . . . This was 1979, the year that showed us we could make our own destinies. We were rebelling because rebelling was all we could do to quell the rage in our teenage veins. Together as girls we found the courage we had been told was not in us.\u201d<br /><br /><b>In Journey from the Land of No</b> Roya Hakakian recalls her childhood and adolescence in prerevolutionary Iran with candor and verve. The result is a beautifully written coming-of-age story about one deeply intelligent and perceptive girl\u2019s attempt to \u00ef\u00ac?nd an authentic voice of her own at a time of cultural closing and repression. Remarkably, she manages to re-create a time and place dominated by religious fanaticism, violence, and fear with an open heart and often with great humor.<br /><br />Hakakian was twelve years old in 1979 when the revolution swept through Tehran. The daughter of an esteemed poet, she grew up in a household that hummed with intellectual life. Family gatherings were punctuated by witty, satirical exchanges and spontaneous recitations of poetry. But the Hakakians were also part of the very small Jewish population in Iran who witnessed the iron fist of the Islamic fundamentalists increasingly tightening its grip. It is with the innocent confusion of youth that Roya describes her discovery of a swastika\u2014\u201ca plus sign gone awry, a dark reptile with four hungry claws\u201d\u2014painted on the wall near her home. As a schoolgirl she watched as friends accused of reading blasphemous books were escorted from class by Islamic Society guards, never to return. Only much later did Roya learn that she was spared a similar fate because her teacher admired her writing.<br /><br />Hakakian relates in the most poignant, and at times painful, ways what life was like for women after the country fell into the hands of Islamic fundamentalists who had declared an insidious war against them, but we see it all through the eyes of a strong, youthful optimist who somehow came up in the world believing that she was different, knowing she was special. At her loneliest, Roya discovers the consolations of writing while sitting on the rooftop of her house late at night. There, \u201cpen in hand, I led my own chorus of words, with a melody of my own making.\u201d And she discovers the craft that would ultimately enable her to find her own voice and become her own person.<br /><br />A wonderfully evocative story, <b>Journey from the Land of No</b> reveals an Iran most readers have not encountered and marks the debut of a stunning new talent.",

    "description": "Afshin Molavi, a young journalist and writer born in Iran and educated in the West, traveled his homeland for more than a year, encountering every facet of Iranian society students of the right and left, bazaar merchants, Islamic clerics, pro-democracy journalists, Islamic hard-liners, reformist politicians, grumbling taxi drivers, urban slum dwellers, partying teenagers, village farmers, handicapped war veterans, and kids hooked on anything western. All opened their hearts to him, speaking candidly about a wide range of issues: unemployment, politics, freedom, religion, poetry, history, the Internet, the legacy of the Islamic revolution, the current pro-democracy movement, Iran's relations with the West, and much more. Throughout his meetings and travels, Molavi wove the tale of nearly 3,000 years of Iranian history through pilgrimages to ancient and contemporary sites, shrines, and monuments, vividly explaining the relevance of Iran's past to today's Iranian predicament. The pilgrimages ranges from the tomb of Cyrus the Great on the windswept plains of Pasargad to the splendid rose gardens at the Shiraz shrine for the fourteenth-century poet Hafez, the golden domes of Ayatollah Khomeini's vast mausoleum in Tehran, a haunting war veterans' shrine for survivors of the devastating Iran-Iraq war near the border of Iraq, and the European embassy \"visa pilgrimages\" of college graduates frustrated by bleak job prospects and the social and political restrictions at home. Cutting through the official rhetoric of the Islamic Republic, Molavi adds much-needed context to its political power struggle and demonstrates that the realities of today's Iran are far more complex than if often understood in the West. Through interviews with courageous journalists, students, and pro-democracy advocates who battle an entrenched conservative ruling class unwilling to accommodate popular opinion and numerous conversations with average Iranians frustrated by their deteriorating economy and the conservative stranglehold on power, Molavi chronicles a land and a people hungry for change. Few books have penetrated the soul of Iran both past and present as deeply as this exceptional report on one of the world's most important nations. \"Persian Pilgrimages\" is a journey to remember. \"A rare and important work that examines Iranian society from a grassroots, human level while offering a taste of the grand sweep of Iranian history. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in contemporary Iran.\" R. K. Ramazani, professor emeritus of politics, University of Virginia.",

Fleeing a chain of vengeful pursuers that includes Mexican bandits, the French Foreign Legion, and the relatives of an infatuated Austrian beauty, Flashy is desperate for somewhere to take cover. So desperate, in fact, that he embarks on a perilous secret intelligence-gathering mission to help free a group of Britons being held captive by a tyrannical Abyssinian king. Along the way, of course, are nightmare castles, brigands, massacres, rebellions, orgies, and the loveliest and most lethal women in Africa, all of which will test the limits of the great bounder\u2019s talents for knavery, amorous intrigue, and survival.<br /><br /><i>Flashman on the March\u2014</i>the twelfth book in George MacDonald Fraser\u2019s ever-beloved, always scandalous Flashman Papers series--is Flashman and Fraser at their best.",

    "description": "<em>Simple Justice</em> is generally regarded as the classic account of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s epochal decision outlawing racial segregation and the centerpiece of African-Americans\u2019 ongoing crusade for equal justice under law.<br /><br />The 1954 Supreme Court ruling in the case of Brown v. Board of Education brought centuries of legal segregation in this country to an end. It was and remains, beyond question, one of the truly significant events in American history, \u201cprobably the most important American government act of any kind since the Emancipation Proclamation,\u201d in the view of constitutional scholar Louis H. Pollak. The Brown decision climaxed a long, torturous battle for black equality in education, making hard law out of vague principles and opening the way for the broad civil rights upheavals of the 1960s and beyond.<br /><br /><em>Simple Justice</em> is the story of that battle. Richard Kluger traces the background of the epochal decision, from its remote legal and cultural roots to the complex personalities of those who brought about its realization. The result is a landmark work of popular history, graceful and fascinatingly detailed, the panoramic account of a struggle for human dignity in process since the birth of the nation.<br /><br />Here is the human drama, told in all its dimensions, of the many plaintiffs, men, women, and children, variously scared or defiant but always determined, who made the hard decision to proceed \u2013 bucking the white power structure in Topeka, Kansas; braving night riders in rural South Carolina; rallying fellow high school students in strictly segregated Prince Edward County, Virginia \u2013 and at a dozen other times and places showing their refusal to accept defeat.<br /><br />Here, too, is the extraordinary tale, told for the first time, of the black legal establishment, forced literally to invent itself before it could join the fight, then patiently assembling, in courtroom after courtroom, a body of law that would serve to free its people from thralldom to unjust laws. Heroes abound, some obscure, like Charles Houston (who built Howard Law School into a rigorous academy for black lawyers) and the Reverend J.A. DeLaine (the minister-teacher who, despite bitter opposition, organized and led the first crucial fight for educational equality in the Jim Crow South), others like Thurgood Marshall, justly famous \u2013 but all of whose passionate devotion proved intense enough to match their mission.<br /><br />Reading <em>Simple Justice</em>, we see how black Americans\u2019 groundswell urge for fair treatment collides with the intransigence of white supremacists in a grinding legal campaign that inevitably found its way to the halls and chambers of the Supreme Court for a final showdown. Kluger searches out and analyzes what went on there during the months of hearings and deliberations, often behind closed doors, laying bare the doubts, disagreements, and often deeply held convictions of the nine Justices. He shows above all how Chief Justice Earl Warren, new to the Court but old in the ways of politics, achieved the impossible \u2013 a unanimous decision to reverse the 58-year-old false doctrine of \u201cseparate but equal\u201d education for blacks. Impeccably researched and elegantly written, this may be the most revealing report ever published of America\u2019s highest court at work.<br /><br />Based on extensive interviews and both published and unpublished documentary sources, <em>Simple Justice</em> has the lineaments of an epic. It will stand as the classic study of a turning point in our history.",

    "description": "Meghan Daum is one of the most celebrated nonfiction writers of her generation, widely recognized for the fresh, provocative approach with which she unearths hidden fault lines in the American landscape. From her well-remembered New Yorker essays about the financial demands of big-city ambition and the ethereal, strangely old-fashioned allure of cyber relationships to her dazzlingly hilarious riff in Harper's about musical passions that give way to middle-brow paraphernalia, Daum delves into the center of things while closely examining the detritus that spills out along the way. She speaks to questions at the root of the contemporary experience, from the search for authenticity and interpersonal connection in a society defined by consumerism and media; to the disenchantment of working in a \"glamour profession\"; to the catastrophic effects of living among New York City's terminal hipsters. With precision and well-balanced irony, Daum implicates herself as readily as she does the targets that fascinate and horrify her. In a review of The KGB Bar Reader, in which Daphne Merkin singled out Daum's essay about the inability to mourn a friend's death, Merkin wrote: \"It's brutally quick, the way this happens, this falling in love with a writer's style. Daum's story hooked me by the second line. Hmm, I thought, this is a writer worth suspending my routines for.\"",

    "description": "Jackie Kennedy quite famously said, \"I want to live my life, not record it.\" She remains elusive, her interior life hidden, her feelings and motivations secret. Yet who has not wondered what lay behind those sunglasses? Haven't we all wondered how Jackie felt about Jack's womanizing? How could she not have known? How did she tolerate it? How did her childhood passions and turbulent family life shape her choices? How did her love of fashion and culture influence the White House? What did she think about Marilyn Monroe? Why did she ever marry Onassis? What made her take a job in publishing when she clearly didn't need one? How did she endure the loss of her babies, the pressure of the Kennedy political machine, the murder of her husband, the never ending paparazzi, and the news of her imminent death?<br /><br />In this powerful, poignant, and sweeping novel, Ruth Francisco tells Jackie's story in Jackie's voice and boldly plunges into the subtext of her public life, reimagining her thoughts and feelings between the lines of recorded history.",

    "description": "Young is back with the eagerly awaited follow-up to his account of a hilariously failed attempt to conquer the Manhattan social and professional scene in <i>How to Lose Friends and Alienate People</i>. All the elements that turned Toby's earlier memoir into a bestseller from coast to coast and on both sides of the Atlantic are back, too. Well, some things have changed for Toby-he has married his girlfriend from <i>How to Lose Friends and Alienate People</i> and now has two kids, and he has moved from the Manhattan that treated him none too kindly to London. But Toby remains Toby, and what Graydon Carter of <i>Vanity Fair</i> called Toby's \"brown thumb\" continues to work its magic, transforming opportunities into cringeworthy debacles and leading to situations that are classic Toby Young territory. Toby gleefully recounts such dubious journalistic assignments as posing as a patient at a penis-enlargement clinic and as a greeter at a Wal-Mart. He has misadventures in Los Angeles as a screenwriter for films that never quite get made, he's been a contestant on an abysmal reality show that absolutely no one watched, and he has acted in a one-man play that was utterly savaged by the critics. Yes, Toby has become a dutiful husband and a devoted dad, but he's as relentlessly self-sabotaging as ever, with a demonstrated knack for attracting misfortune, publicity-and devoted readers.",

    "description": "From the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and author of the essay collection \"Shiksa Goddess\" (\"Utterly delicious\"--Judith Thurman), a dazzling debut novel, a comedy about New York's urban gentry living in a post-9/11 world--the arbiters of fashion and the doyennes of charity balls; about the rich and the nouveau rich(er), the glamorous and the desperate to be. <br />We meet Francesca Weissman, the Upper East Side pediatrician rated number one by \"Manhattan\" magazine, who takes us into the upper strata of privilege and aspiration (she's originally from Queens with a father in hosiery; life on the fringes of glittering New York is fine with her) . . . Samantha Acton, thoroughbred descendant of the Van Rensselaers and the Carnegies, who defines the social order in the great tradition of Mrs. Astor and Babe Paley . . . Judy Tremont from Modesto, California, daughter of a cop--her life's work, her obsession, is New York society and its richest families . . . Barry Santorini, Republican, moviemaker, winner of twelve Oscars, and his wife, the Italian supermarket heiress and former media rep for Giorgio Armani . . . and many more. <br />As \"Elements of Style \"opens out, we see a madcap mosaic of the social lives and mores of twenty-first century Manhattan--of romance, work, family, and friendship. Satiric, fierce, touching--and deliciously Wasserstein. <br />\"Pure Wendy! She effortlessly makes the leap from stage to page with a novel that is loving, compassionate, flat-out funny. Wendy loved the word 'scintillating, ' which is the best way to describe her stunning \"Elements of Style.\"\"<br />--John Guare <br />\"Wasserstein gets the trappings and tribulations (of friendship and of romance) right, making her depiction of the rich and fab trying to connect with one another witty and entertaining.\"<br />--\"Publishers Weekly\" <br />\"Bold, nimble, and funny to its fingertips, \"Elements of Style\" is a delight, a triumph. A book that no self-respecting New Yorker should be without. Those cursed with the hell of multiple residences will self-evidently need several copies--and spares, for houseguests.\"<br />--Flora Fraser",

    "description": "Tatiana du Plessix, the wife of a French diplomat, was a beautiful, sophisticated \"white Russian\" who had been the muse of the famous Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. Alexander Liberman, the ambitious son of a prominent Russian Jew, was a gifted magazine editor and aspiring artist. As part of the progressive artistic Russian emigre community living in Paris in the 1930s, the two were destined to meet. They began a passionate affair, and the year after Paris was occupied in World War II they fled to New York with Tatiana's young daughter, Francine.There they determinedly rose to the top of high society, holding court to a Who's Who list of the midcentury's intellectuals and entertainers. Flamboyant and outrageous, bold and brilliant, they were irresistible to friends like Marlene Dietrich, Salvador Dali, and the publishing tycoon Conde Nast. But to those who knew them well they were also highly neurotic, narcissistic, and glacially self-promoting, prone to cut out of their lives, with surgical precision, close friends who were no longer of use to them.<br /><br />Tatiana became an icon of New York fashion, and the hats she designed for Saks Fifth Avenue were de rigueur for stylish women everywhere. Alexander Liberman, who devotedly raised Francine as his own child from the time she was nine, eventually came to preside over the entire Conde Nast empire. The glamorous life they shared was both creative and destructive and was marked by an exceptional bond forged out of their highly charged love and raging self-centeredness. Their obsessive adulation of success and elegance was elevated to a kind of worship, and the high drama that characterized their lives followed them to their deaths. Tatiana, increasingly consumed with nostalgia for a long-lost Russia, spent her last years addicted to painkillers. Shortly after her death, Alexander, then age eighty, shocked all who knew him by marrying her nurse.<br /><br /><b>Them: A Portrait of Parents</b> is a beautifully written homage to the extraordinary lives of two fascinating, irrepressible people who were larger than life emblems of a bygone age. Written with honesty and grace by the person who knew them best, this generational saga is a survivor's story. Tatiana and Alexander survived the Russian Revolution, the fall of France, and New York's factory of fame. Their daughter, Francine, survived them.",

Now the seven books of nonfiction that appeared between 1968 and 2003 have been brought together into one thrilling collection.<br /><br /><i>Slouching Towards Bethlehem </i>captures the counterculture of the sixties, its mood and lifestyle, as symbolized by California, Joan Baez, Haight-Ashbury. <i>The White Album </i>covers the revolutionary politics and the \u201ccontemporary wasteland\u201d of the late sixties and early seventies, in pieces on the Manson family, the Black Panthers, and Hollywood. <i>Salvador</i> is a riveting look at the social and political landscape of civil war. <i>Miami</i> exposes the secret role this largely Latin city played in the Cold War, from the Bay of Pigs through Watergate. In <i>After Henry </i>Didion reports on the Reagans, Patty Hearst, and the Central Park jogger case. The eight essays in <i>Political Fictions</i>\u2013on censorship in the media, Gingrich, Clinton, Starr, and \u201ccompassionate conservatism,\u201d among others\u2013show us how we got to the political scene of today. And in <i>Where I Was From </i>Didion shows that California was never the land of the golden dream.",

    "description": "Is it possible to write a sidesplitting novel about the breakup of the perfect marriage? If the writer is Nora Ephron, the answer is a resounding yes. For in this inspired confection of adultery, revenge, group therapy, and pot roast, the creator of <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i> reminds us that comedy depends on anguish as surely as a proper gravy depends on flour and butter.<br /><br />Seven months into her pregnancy, Rachel Samstat discovers that her husband, Mark, is in love with another woman. The fact that the other woman has \"a neck as long as an arm and a nose as long as a thumb and you should see her legs\" is no consolation. Food sometimes is, though, since Rachel writes cookbooks for a living. And in between trying to win Mark back and loudly wishing him dead, Ephron's irrepressible heroine offers some of her favorite recipes. <i>Heartburn </i>is a sinfully delicious novel, as soul-satisfying as mashed potatoes and as airy as a perfect souffl\u00e9.",

    "description": "Helga's mother is white, and her father is black \u2014 and absent. Ostracized throughout her lonely childhood for her dark skin, Helga spends her adult life seeking acceptance. Everywhere she goes \u2014 the American South, Harlem, even Denmark--she feels oppressed. Socially, economically, and psychologically, Helga struggles against the \"quicksand\" of classism, racism, and sexism.<br />One of the most acclaimed and influential writers of the Harlem Renaissance, Nella Larsen published her powerful first novel in 1928. <i>Quicksand</i> features intriguing autobiographical parallels with Larsen's own life, in addition to reflecting many aspects of African-American culture of the 1920s. Alice Walker praised it and <i>Passing</i> (Larsen's second novel, also available in a Dover edition) as \"novels I will never forget. They open up a whole world of experience and struggle that seemed to me, when I first read them years ago, absolutely absorbing, fascinating, and indispensable.\"",

    "description": "SCRABBLE may be truly called America's game. But for every group of \"living-room players\" there is someone who is \"at one with the board.\" In Word Freak, Stefan Fatsis introduces readers to those few, exploring the underground world of colorful characters for which the Scrabble game is life \u2014 playing competitively in tournaments across the country. It is also the story of how the Scrabble game was invented by an unemployed architect during the Great Depression and how it has grown into the hugely successful, challenging, and beloved game it is today. Along the way, Fatsis chronicles his own obsession with the game and his development as a player from novice to expert. More than a book about hardcore Scrabble players, Word Freak is also an examination of notions of brilliance, memory, language, competition, and the mind that celebrates the uncanny creative powers in us all.",

    "description": "<i>Tales of compelling power by one of America's greatest writers</i><br /><br />Stung by the critical reception and lack of commercial success of his previous two works, <i>Moby-Dick</i> and <i>Pierre</i>, Herman Melville became obsessed with the difficulties of communicating his vision to readers. His sense of isolation lies at the heart of these later works. \"Billy Budd, Sailor,\" a classic confrontation between good and evil, is the story of an innocent young man unable to defend himself against a wrongful accusation. The other selections here--\"Bartleby,\" \"The Encantadas,\" \"Benito Cereno,\" and \"The Piazza\"--also illuminate, in varying guises, the way fictions are created and shared with a wider society.<br /><br />In his introduction Frederick Busch discusses Melville's preoccupation with his \"correspondence with the world,\" his quarrel with silence, and why fiction was, for Melville,\"a matter of life and death.\"<br /><br />Bartleby --<br />The piazza --<br />The Encantadas --<br />The bell-tower --<br />Benito Cereno --<br />The paradise of bachelors and the tartarus of maids --<br />Billy Budd, sailor.",

(how is it possible to put on 4 pounds in the middle of the night? Could flesh have somehow solidified becoming denser and heavier? Repulsive, horrifying notion), alcohol units 4 (excellent), cigarettes 21 (poor but will give up totally tomorrow), number of correct lottery numbers 2 (better, but nevertheless useless)...\"<br /><br /><i>Bridget Jones' Diary</i> is the devastatingly self-aware, laugh-out-loud daily chronicle of Bridget's permanent, doomed quest for self-improvement \u2014 a year in which she resolves to: reduce the circumference of each thigh by 1.5 inches, visit the gym three times a week not just to buy a sandwich, form a functional relationship with a responsible adult, and learn to program the VCR.<br /><br />Over the course of the year, Bridget loses a total of 72 pounds but gains a total of 74. She remains, however, optimistic. Through it all, Bridget will have you helpless with laughter, and \u2014 like millions of readers the world round \u2014 you'll find yourself shouting, \"Bridget Jones is me!\"",

Memories of her life still glow in her fading consciousness, but she imagines writing a history of the world. Instead, Moon Tiger is her own history, the life of a strong, independent woman, with its often contentious relations with family and friends. At its center \u2014 forever frozen in time, the still point of her turning world \u2014 is the cruelly truncated affair with Tom, a British tank commander whom Claudia knew as a reporter in Egypt during World War II.",

    "description": "In \"Digging\", the first poem in Opened Ground, Heaney likens his pen to both spade and gun. With these metaphors in place, he makes clear his difficult poetic task: to delve into the past, both personal and historic, while remaining ever mindful of the potentially fatal power of language.<br /><br />Born and raised in Northern Ireland, where any hint of Gaelic tradition in one's speech was considered a political act, Heaney is all too aware of the dire consequences of speaking one's mind. Indeed, during times of crisis, he has been expected to appear on television and dispense political wisdom. <br /><br />Most often, however, he stays out of the fray and opts for a supreme sense of empathy to guide his words. As excavator--of earth, of his beloved Gaelic, of his own life--Heaney is unmatched. In \"Bone Dreams\", the archaeologist's task is synonymous with reaching for a cultural past: I push back through dictions, Elizabethan canopies, Norman devices, the erotic mayflowers of Provence and the ivied Latins of churchmen to the scop's twang, the iron flash of consonants cleaving the line.<br /><br />And in early poems like \"Blackberry Picking\", Heaney's images--deftly, delightfully--carry us back to childhood fields: At first, just one, a glossy purple clot Among others, red, green, hard as a knot. You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet Like thickened wine: summer's blood was in it Leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for Picking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger Sent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam pots Where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots. Round hayfields, cornfields and potato drills We trekked and picked until the cans were full... Opened Ground is a pleasure and a triumph. These three decades of work confirm Heaney as one of the most important poets of his time. --Martha Silano",

This volume is ideal for instructors who want to assign only the Tales and have no need for the complete Chaucer. An overview briefly outlines the basic plot and main idea of each Tale, while a section on language and versification helps students with pronunciation. Explanatory notes provide information on sources, problematic passages, and critical interpretations. Additional pedagogy includes a glossary, a section on Chaucer's life, an index, a general bibliography, and a list of abbreviations.",

    "description": "Virgil (Publius Vergilius Maro) was born in 70 BCE near Mantua and was educated at Cremona, Milan and Rome. Slow in speech, shy in manner, thoughtful in mind, weak in health, he went back north for a quiet life. Influenced by the group of poets there, he may have written some of the doubtful poems included in our Virgilian manuscripts. All his undoubted extant work is written in his perfect hexameters. Earliest comes the collection of ten pleasingly artificial bucolic poems, the \"Eclogues,\" which imitated freely Theocritus's idylls. They deal with pastoral life and love. Before 29 BCE came one of the best of all didactic works, the four hooks of Georgics on tillage, trees, cattle, and bees. Virgil's remaining years were spent in composing his great, not wholly finished, epic the \"Aeneid,\" on the traditional theme of Rome's origins through Aeneas of Troy. Inspired by the Emperor Augustus's rule, the poem is Homeric in metre and method but influenced also by later Greek and Roman literature, philosophy, and learning, and deeply Roman in spirit. Virgil died in 19 BCE at Brundisium on his way home from Greece, where he had intended to round off the \"Aeneid.\" He had left in Rome a request that all its twelve books should be destroyed if he were to die then, but they were published by the executors of his will.<br /><br />The Loeb Classical Library edition of Virgil is in two volumes.",

    "description": "<b>The Extraordinary <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller</b> <p> In California's central valley, five women and one man join to discuss Jane Austen's novels. Over the six months they get together, marriages are tested, affairs begin, unsuitable arrangements become suitable, and love happens. With her eye for the frailties of human behavior and her ear for the absurdities of social intercourse, Karen Joy Fowler has never been wittier nor her characters more appealing. The result is a delicious dissection of modern relationships. </p><p> Dedicated Austenites will delight in unearthing the echoes of Austen that run through the novel, but most readers will simply enjoy the vision and voice that, despite two centuries of separation, unite two great writers of brilliant social comedy.</p>",

    "description": "Ann Patchett and the late Lucy Grealy met in college in 1981, and, after enrolling in the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, began a friendship that would be as defining to both of their lives as their work. In Grealy\u2019s critically acclaimed memoir <i>Autobiography of a Face</i>, she wrote about losing part of her jaw to childhood cancer, years of chemotherapy and radiation, and endless reconstructive surgeries. In <i>Truth and Beauty</i>, the story isn\u2019t Lucy\u2019s life or Ann\u2019s life but the parts of their lives they shared. This is a portrait of unwavering commitment that spans twenty years, from the long winters of the Midwest to surgical wards to book parties in New York. Through love, fame, drugs, and despair, this is what it means to be part of two lives that are intertwined--and what happens when one is left behind.",

    "description": "<i>Les Mis\u00e9rables</i> is the great epic masterpiece of the mid-nineteenth century. Begun in 1845, the year Louis Philippe conferred a peerage and a lifetime seat in the Senate upon Victor Hugo, it was completed when the author was living in exile in the Channel Islands. <i>Les Mis\u00e9rables</i> is a product as well as a document of the political, social, and religious upheaval that followed the Napoleonic Wars and Europe's great democratic revolutions. The story is centered on Jean Valjean, a peasant who enters the novel a hardened criminal after nineteen years spent in prison for stealing a loaf of bread for the starving children of his sister. The path of Valjean's last twenty-five years, leading from the French provinces to the battlefield of Waterloo and the ramparts of Paris during the Uprising of 1832, introduces us to secret societies of revolutionaries and the vast world of the French lower classes. Jean Valjean's flight from the police agent Javert--the prototype of over a hundred years of fictional detectives--culminates in one of the most famous scenes in all literature, the chase through the sewers of Paris. <i>Les Mis\u00e9rables</i> sold out its large first printing in twenty-four hours and has remained enormously popular. This edition is the classic English translation of Hugo's friend Charles Wilbour, which appeared the same year the novel was published in France.",

But Muldoon, more than most, is an artist in high flight from self-repetition and the deadening business of living up to created expectations.\" The body of work in Poems 1968-1998 -- a comprehensive gathering of Paul Muldoon's eight volumes -- finds a great poet reinventing himself at every turn. Muldoon's career thus far shows us a fascinatingly mutable climate in which each freshening period brings -- as his first collection was predictively titled -- new weather.\"",

    "description": "<b>Every family has a story. Every story, eventually, must be told.</b><br /><br />For most of their lives, Julian Perel and his sister, Paula, lived in a house cast in silence, witnesses to a father struggling with a devastating secret too painful to share. Though their father took his demons to the grave, his past refuses to rest.<br /><br />As adults, brother and sister struggle to find their voices. A scientist governed by numbers and logic, Julian now lives an ordered life of routine and seclusion. <i>My father gave up his language and his homeland. But he carried his sadness with him, under his skin. It was mine now. </i>In contrast, Paula has entered the world as eagerly as Julian retracts from it. An aspiring opera singer, she is always moving, buoyant with sound. <i>Singing was the only gift I could offer to my father. I filled the house with music. I tried to give him joy. . . .</i><br /><br />Yet both their lives begin to change on a <i>Wednesday, miercoles, the day that sounds like miracles.</i> Before embarking on a European opera tour, Paula asks her housekeeper, Sola, to stay at her place--and to look after Julian in the apartment above. Yet Sola, too, has a story. <i>I want to clean myself like the window of a house, make myself clear for things to pass through. Flat and quiet.</i><br /><br />As Paula uncovers pieces of her father's early life in Budapest and the horrifying truth of his past, Julian bears witness to Sola's story--revelations that help all three learn how to both surrender and revere the shadows that have followed them for so long.<br /><br /><i>The Speed of Light</i> is a powerful debut about three unforgettable souls who overcome the tragedies of the past to reconnect with one another and the world around them. In an extraordinary accomplishment, Elizabeth Rosner has created a novel of love and redemption that proves the pain of the untold story is far greater than even the most difficult truth.",

    "description": "Born into a poor family in Spain, In\u00e9s, a seamstress, finds herself condemned to a life of hard work without reward or hope for the future. It is the sixteenth century, the beginning of the Spanish conquest of the Americas, and when her shiftless husband disappears to the New World, In\u00e9s uses the opportunity to search for him as an excuse to flee her stifling homeland and seek adventure. After her treacherous journey takes her to Peru, she learns that her husband has died in battle. Soon she begins a fiery love affair with a man who will change the course of her life: Pedro de Valdivia, war hero and field marshal to the famed Francisco Pizarro.<br /><br />Valdivia's dream is to succeed where other Spaniards have failed: to become the conquerer of Chile. The natives of Chile are fearsome warriors, and the land is rumored to be barren of gold, but this suits Valdivia, who seeks only honor and glory. Together the lovers In\u00e9s Su\u00e1rez and Pedro de Valdivia will build the new city of Santiago, and they will wage a bloody, ruthless war against the indigenous Chileans\u2014the fierce local Indians led by the chief Michimalonko, and the even fiercer Mapuche from the south. The horrific struggle will change them forever, pulling each of them toward their separate destinies.<br /><br /><em>In\u00e9s of My Soul</em> is a work of breathtaking scope: meticulously researched, it engagingly dramatizes the known events of In\u00e9s Su\u00e1rez's life, crafting them into a novel full of the narrative brilliance and passion readers have come to expect from Isabel Allende.",

    "description": "Praised as a \"ruthless descendant of Holmes\" (\"Publishers Weekly\"), Agent Pendergast has become one of crime fiction's most endearing characters. His greatest enemy is one who has stalked him all of his life, his cunning and diabolical brother Diogenes. And Diogenes has thrown down the gauntlet. Now, several of the people closest to Pendergast are viciously murdered, and Pendergast is framed for the deeds. On the run from federal authorities, with only the help of his old friend NYPD Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta, Pendergast must stop his brother. But how can he stop a man that is his intellectual equal--one who has had twenty years to plan the world's most horrendous crime? <br />",

    "description": "With only a yellowing photograph in hand, a young man -- also named Jonathan Safran Foer -- sets out to find the woman who may or may not have saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Accompanied by an old man haunted by memories of the war; an amorous dog named Sammy Davis, Junior, Junior; and the unforgettable Alex, a young Ukrainian translator who speaks in a sublimely butchered English, Jonathan is led on a quixotic journey over a devastated landscape and into an unexpected past.<br /><br />By turns comic and tragic, but always passionate, wildly inventive, and touched with an indelible humanity, this debut novel is a powerful, deeply felt story of searching: for the past, family, and truth.",

    "description": "Dear Friend, <br /><br /> Twenty years ago, I made a decision to wake up and alter the direction of my life. This set in motion a series of events that proved to me there are no coincidences. Every event we experience and every person we meet has been put in our path for a reason. When we awaken to this fundamental truth, we begin to understand that a benevolent force of energy is available to guide and direct our lives. I call this energy the unmistakable touch of grace. <br /><br /> This book tells the story of how grace has transformed my life as well as the lives of others. While some stories may seem unbelievable, all of them are true. As you follow the journey, you'll start to see the influence of grace in your life, too. And, once you've finished, the way you view your life (and the people in it) will be changed forever. <br /><br /> Many blessings,<br /> Cheryl",

    "description": "Binh, a Vietnamese cook, flees Saigon in 1929, disgracing his family to serve as a galley hand at sea. The taunts of his now-deceased father ringing in his ears, Binh answers an ad for a live-in cook at a Parisian household, and soon finds himself employed by Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas.<br /><br />Toklas and Stein hold court in their literary salon, for which the devoted yet acerbic Binh serves as chef, and as a keen observer of his \"Mesdames\" and their distinguished guests. But when the enigmatic literary ladies decide to journey back to America, Binh is faced with a monumental choice: will he, the self-imposed \"exile,\" accompany them to yet another new country, return to his native Vietnam, or make Paris his home?",

    "description": "Willem de Kooning is one of the most important artists of the twentieth century, a true \u201cpainter\u2019s painter\u201d whose protean work continues to inspire many artists. In the thirties and forties, along with Arshile Gorky and Jackson Pollock, he became a key figure in the revolutionary American movement of abstract expressionism. Of all the painters in that group, he worked the longest and was the most prolific, creating powerful, startling images well into the 1980s.<br /><br />The first major biography of de Kooning captures both the life and work of this complex, romantic figure in American culture. Ten years in the making, and based on previously unseen letters and documents as well as on hundreds of interviews, this is a fresh, richly detailed, and masterful portrait. The young de Kooning overcame an unstable, impoverished, and often violent early family life to enter the Academie in Rotterdam, where he learned both classic art and guild techniques. Arriving in New York as a stowaway from Holland in 1926, he underwent a long struggle to become a painter and an American, developing a passionate friendship with his fellow immigrant Arshile Gorky, who was both a mentor and an inspiration. During the Depression, de Kooning emerged as a central figure in the bohemian world of downtown New York, surviving by doing commercial work and painting murals for the WPA. His first show at the Egan Gallery in 1948 was a revelation. Soon, the critics Harold Rosenberg and Thomas Hess were championing his work, and de Kooning took his place as the charismatic leader of the New York school\u2014just as American art began to dominate the international scene.<br /><br />Dashingly handsome and treated like a movie star on the streets of downtown New York, de Kooning had a tumultuous marriage to Elaine de Kooning, herself a fascinating character of the period. At the height of his fame, he spent his days painting powerful abstractions and intense, disturbing pictures of the female figure\u2014and his nights living on the edge, drinking, womanizing, and talking at the Cedar bar with such friends as Franz Kline and Frank O\u2019Hara. By the 1960s, exhausted by the feverish art world, he retreated to the Springs on Long Island, where he painted an extraordinary series of lush pastorals. In the 1980s, as he slowly declined into what was almost certainly Alzheimer\u2019s, he created a vast body of haunting and ethereal late work.<br /><br />This is an authoritative and brilliant exploration of the art, life, and world of an American master.",

It is an epic narrative that moves from California to Kashmir, France, and England, and back to California again. Along the way there are tales of princesses lured from their homes by demons, legends of kings forced to defend their kingdoms against evil. And there is always love, gained and lost, uncommonly beautiful and mortally dangerous.",

    "description": "English magicians were once the wonder of the known world, with fairy servants at their beck and call; they could command winds, mountains, and woods. But by the early 1800s they have long since lost the ability to perform magic. They can only write long, dull papers about it, while fairy servants are nothing but a fading memory.<br /><br />But at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire, the rich, reclusive Mr Norrell has assembled a wonderful library of lost and forgotten books from England's magical past and regained some of the powers of England's magicians. He goes to London and raises a beautiful young woman from the dead. Soon he is lending his help to the government in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte, creating ghostly fleets of rain-ships to confuse and alarm the French.<br /><br />All goes well until a rival magician appears. Jonathan Strange is handsome, charming, and talkative -- the very opposite of Mr Norrell. Strange thinks nothing of enduring the rigors of campaigning with Wellington's army and doing magic on battlefields. Astonished to find another practicing magician, Mr Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. For Mr Norrell, their power is something to be cautiously controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient, shadowy figure of the Raven King, a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie, and the most legendary magician of all. Eventually Strange's heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear.<br /><br />Sophisticated, witty, and ingeniously convincing, Susanna Clarke's magisterial novel weaves magic into a flawlessly detailed vision of historical England. She has created a world so thoroughly enchanting that eight hundred pages leave readers longing for more.<br /><br />Librarian's note: See alternate cover edition with ISBN 1582344167 ahref=\"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30362645-jonathan-strange-mr-norrell&quot;&gt;here\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3...</a>",

Kennedy se esconde una compleja conspiraci\u00f3n internacional cuya cabeza visible es Lee Harvey Oswald, pero detr\u00e1s de Oswald hay un ni\u00f1o problem\u00e1tico con un atormentado mundo interior, un joven cuyos ideales entran constantemente en conflicto con la realidad que los niega.<br /><br />Libra es una especulaci\u00f3n asombrosamente veraz, literariamente impecable y escalofriantemente convincente de los sucesos que desencadenaron el asesinato de Kennedy y de la atm\u00f3sfera general de aquellos tormentosos a\u00f1os en que el derrumbamiento del gran sue\u00f1o americano abri\u00f3 la puerta al secretismo gubernamental. De esta \u00e9poca surgen los elementos conspirativos que caracterizan casi toda la obra de este l\u00facido int\u00e9rprete de nuestro tiempo. <br /><br />Figuras reales mezcladas con personajes de ficci\u00f3n con verdadero virtuosismo e intrigas casi inveros\u00edmiles en una de las obras mayores de Don DeLillo, una novela que fascina desde la primera p\u00e1gina. Escritor obsesivo con un proyecto literario de consciente continuidad, DeLillo es una de las m\u00e1s importantes voces narrativas de Estados Unidos.",

    "description": "Robert Burns (1759 \u2013 1796) called himself \"an Aeolian harp strung to every wind of heaven.\" His first volume of poems, entitled <i>Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect</i>, was published in 1786. An immediate success, it established Burns's poetic reputation, which has grown over two centuries to the point where he is not only the Scottish national poet but the object of a cult unique in British poetry.<br />The present volume contains 43 of his finest poems and songs, reprinted unabridged from an authoritative tenth-century edition. Included are \"The Twa Dogs,\" a deft satire of the Scottish upper classes; \"To a Mouse,\" one of the poet's best known, most charming works; \"Address to the Unco Guid,\" an attack on Puritan hypocrisy; \"Holy Willie's Prayer,\" one of the great verse-satires of all times; as well as such favorites as \"The Cotter's Saturday Night,\" \"To a Mountain Daisy,\" \"The Holy Fair,\" \"Address to the Deil,\" \"The Death and Dying Words of Poor Mailie,\" and many more.<br />In addition to his poetic undertakings, Burns almost single-handedly preserved and revived the traditional Scottish song, and this volume includes a rich selection of these works: \"A Red, Red Rose,\" \"Auld Lang Syne,\" \"Comin' thro' the Rye,\" \"My Heart's in the Highlands,\" \"My Love, She's But a Lassie Yet,\" and a host of others.",

Willy has a big job to do. When his grandfather falls ill, it is up to Willy alone to save their farm from the tax collector. Willy enters the National Dogsled Race, where he must beat the Indian Stone Fox and his five beautiful Samoyed dogs.</p><p>Allen Brewster has an amazing idea for his school science project: human photosynthesis, turning sunlight into food for humans. Everyone laughs at his outrageous scheme -- until Allen turns green, sprouts roots, and develops an overwhelming desire to soak up the sun instead of eating his dinner. Allan is turning into a plant! No one seems to believe that he isn't just playing a practical joke -- no one, that is, except the President of the United States, who declares Allen a threat to national security! Suddenly Allen Brewster and his discovery are...TOP SECRET!</p>",

    "description": "Until that September of 1952, Luke Chandler had never kept a secret or told a single lie. But in the long, hot summer of his seventh year, two groups of migrant workers \u2014 and two very dangerous men \u2014 came through the Arkansas Delta to work the Chandler cotton farm. And suddenly mysteries are flooding Luke\u2019s world.<br /><br />A brutal murder leaves the town seething in gossip and suspicion. A beautiful young woman ignites forbidden passions. A fatherless baby is born ... and someone has begun furtively painting the bare clapboards of the Chandler farmhouse, slowly, painstakingly, bathing the run-down structure in gleaming white. And as young Luke watches the world around him, he unravels secrets that could shatter lives \u2014 and change his family and his town forever....<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Paperback edition.</i>",

    "description": "Eat a take-out meal, buy a pair of shoes, or read a newspaper, and you\u2019re soon faced with a bewildering amount of garbage. The United States is the planet\u2019s number-one producer of trash. Each American throws out 4.5 pounds daily. But garbage is also a global problem; the Pacific Ocean is today six times more abundant with plastic waste than zooplankton. How did we end up with this much rubbish, and where does it all go? Journalist and filmmaker Heather Rogers answers these questions by taking readers on a grisly, oddly fascinating tour through the underworld of garbage.<br /><br />Said to \u201cread like a thriller\u201d (<i>Library Journal</i>), <i>Gone Tomorrow</i> excavates the history of rubbish handling from the 1800s to the present, pinpointing the roots of today\u2019s waste-addicted society. With a \u201clively authorial voice\u201d (<i>New York Press</i>), Rogers draws connections between modern industrial production, consumer culture, and our throwaway lifestyle. She also investigates controversial topics like the politics of recycling and the export of trash to poor countries, while offering a potent argument for change.<br /><br /><br />",

An essential book for a full understanding of one of our major poets.<br /><br />Color woodcut, Night Scene, by Neil Welliver. Courtesy of the artist.",

    "description": "Strand's poems occupy a place that exists between abstraction and the sensuous particulars of experience. It is a place created by a voice that moves with unerring ease between the commonplace and the sublime. The poems are filled with \"the weather of leavetaking,\" but they are also unexpectedly funny. The erasure of self and the depredations of time are seen as sources of sorrow, but also as grounds for celebration. This is one of the difficult truths these poems dramatize with stoicism and wit. The winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, <b>Blizzard of One</b> is an extraordinary book--the summation of the work of a lifetime by one of our very few true masters of the art of poetry.",

    "description": "Here is the first comprehensive collection of writings from the Women's Liberation Movement, including articles, poems, photo-graphs, and manifestos. This anthology captures the range of problems being considered by the new feminists, and the variety of approaches to analysis and action. Over fifty contributors, all women, write about how the \"51% minority group\" is used and abused by the major institutions of our society--marriage, the family, church, courts, the media, welfare, the schools, the professions, business, and industry. A section on the psychological and sexual repression of women attacks the freudian view of the female, and discusses the problems of the aging woman, abortion and birth control, prostitution, the persecution of lesbians. Black women, a Mexican woman, high school women, ex-New Leftists, housewives, and seasoned feminists speak from their experience in tones that range from detachment to outrage. <br /><br />ARE MEN REALLY THE ENEMY?<br />A Questionnaire by Jayne West, from No More Fun and Games <br /><br />True or False <br />__ Woman's work is never done. <br />__ You can't tell a book by its cover. <br />__ Housework can be fun. <br />__ A female dog is referred to as a bitch. <br />__ One of the more degrading terms that can be applied to a man is \"son of a bitch.\" <br /><br />Multiple Choice <br /><br />1. Most rapes are committed by: (a) women; (b) children; (c) men (perverts); (d) I am unable to distinguish rape from ordinary sexual relations. <br /><br />2. Which do you prefer being called: (a) lady; (b) woman; (c) female; (d) girl; (e) none of the above. <br /><br />3. If I could do away with anything I wanted, the first thing I would do away with is: (a) the family; (b) the state; (c) private property; (d) menstrual periods; (e) all of the above. <br /><br />Essay <br /><br />Discuss the variations in tone possible when asking a male druggist: \"Have you Tampax Super?\"",

    "description": "In the early 1950s, Lynette Fromme's world was more or less a paint-by-numbers existence that millions of other suburban children were living in Southern California. Red-haired, freckled, and convivial, she was the child of an in absentia workaholic father and a reclusive mother. She sang in the school choir and her dance troupe performed before President Eisenhower. As a young teenager she wrote forlorn poetry. Beyond her neighborhood, the counter-culture of Los Angeles was thriving. Lynette began getting interested in, then became attracted to, the freedoms of that world. Little by little, she began losing her way.... That day on the beach marked Lynette's introduction to the world of shade. Charles Manson, freshly released from prison, became her guide to illegal drugs and social outcasts. Over the course of a decade, Lynette would change until she found herself imprisoned for the term of her natural life in the custody of the Attorney General of the United States for attempting to assassinate then-president Gerald Ford. Meticulously researched for over three and a half years, with hundreds of interviews and thousands of pages of testimony to review, in Squeaky author Jess Bravin has created a psychosocial masterpiece of one American girl who ran away, and ran too far.",

But from fifth grade and Roger Mancuso, equal parts baby Brando and court jester, through her early adult life with New Media executive Neil Schmertz, a babytalker who prefers spooning to sex, Phoebe trudges defiantly through guyland, armed with a tart tongue, and propelled by an insatiable desire to be loved.",

    "description": "From Neal Gabler, the definitive portrait of one of the most important figures in twentieth-century American entertainment and cultural history.<br />Seven years in the making and meticulously researched - Gabler is the first writer to be given complete access to the Disney archives - this is the full story of a man whose work left an ineradicable brand on our culture but whose life has largely been enshrouded in myth.<br />Gabler shows us the young Walt Disney breaking free of a heartland childhood of discipline and deprivation and making his way to Hollywood. We see the visionary, whose desire for escape honed an innate sense of what people wanted to see on the screen and, when combined with iron determination and obsessive perfectionism, led him to the reinvention of animation. It was Disney, first with Mickey Mouse and then with his feature films - most notably <i>Snow White</i>, <i>Pinocchio</i>, <i>Fantasia</i>, <i>Dumbo</i>, and <i>Bambi</i> - who transformed animation from a novelty based on movement to an art form that presented an illusion of life.<br />We see him reimagine the amusement park with Disneyland, prompting critics to coin the word <i>Disneyfication</i> to describe the process by which reality can be modified to fit one's personal desires. At the same time, he provided a new way to connect with American history through his live-action films and purveyed a view of the country so coherent that even today one can speak meaningfully of \"Walt Disney's America.\" We see how the True-Life Adventure nature documentaries he produced helped create the environmental movement by sensitizing the general public to issues of conservation. And we see how he reshaped the entertainment industry by building a synergistic empire that combined film, television, theme parks, music, book publishing, and merchandise in a way that was unprecedented and was later widely imitated.<br />Gabler also reveals a wounded, lonely, and often disappointed man, who, despite worldwide success, was plagued with financial problems much of his life, suffered a nervous breakdown, and at times retreated into pitiable seclusion in his workshop making model trains. Gabler explores accusations that Disney was a red-baiter, an anti-Semite, an embittered alcoholic. But whatever the characterizations of Disney's personal life, he appealed to the nation by demonstrating the power of wish fulfillment and the triumph of the American imagination. Walt Disney showed how one could impose one's will on the world.<br />This is a masterly biography, a revelation of both the work and the man - of both the remarkable accomplishment and the hidden life.",

    "description": "Life's greatest gifts come to us by accident. Barbara Delinsky has always had a gift for creating tales of extraordinary emotional power and depth. Now the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Three Wishes</i> surpasses herself once again in a novel that takes readers on a journey as richly textured, colorful, and poignant as the northern California landscape in which the book is set. <p>Rachel Keats and Jack McGill were artists, deeply in love when they married, until the rush of life took its toll. After ten years of marriage, they divorced and went their separate ways. Jack stayed in San Francisco. Rachel moved with their two young daughters to Big Sur. </p><p>Six years later, an alarming middle-of-the-night phone call demands that Jack put aside his own busy life and career as a leading architect to rush to his ex-wife's hospital bed. While she lies comatose, Jack maintains a bedside vigil and finds himself getting to know Rachel better than he ever did -- through their daughters, her friends, and, even more, through her art. Meanwhile, the beauty and grace of the Redwood canyon where she has made her home also work their own special alchemy upon Jack. He begins to see Rachel, his daughters, and the story of his marriage with new eyes. </p><p><i>Coast Road</i> celebrates those things in life that matter most -- the kinship of neighbors, the companionship of friends, and the irreplaceable time spent with children and family. Barbara Delinsky depicts with exquisite accuracy the ties that bind each of us to those people and places we hold most dear.</p>",

    "description": "One of the most acclaimed books of our time, winner of both the Pulitzer and the Francis Parkman prizes, <b>The Power Broker</b> tells the hidden story behind the shaping (and mis-shaping) of twentieth-century New York (city and state) and makes public what few have known: that Robert Moses was, for almost half a century, the single most powerful man of our time in New York, the shaper not only of the city's politics but of its physical structure and the problems of urban decline that plague us today.<br /><br />In revealing how Moses did it--how he developed his public authorities into a political machine that was virtually a fourth branch of government, one that could bring to their knees Governors and Mayors (from La Guardia to Lindsay) by mobilizing banks, contractors, labor unions, insurance firms, even the press and the Church, into an irresistible economic force--Robert Caro reveals how power works in all the cities of the United States. Moses built an empire and lived like an emperor. He personally conceived and completed public works costing 27 billion dollars--the greatest builder America (and probably the world) has ever known. Without ever having been elected to office, he dominated the men who were--even his most bitter enemy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, could not control him--until he finally encountered, in Nelson Rockefeller, the only man whose power (and ruthlessness in wielding it) equalled his own.",

    "description": "<b>The revolutionary literary vision that sowed the seeds of Objectivism, Ayn Rand's groundbreaking philosophy, and brought her immediate worldwide acclaim.</b><br /><br />This modern classic is the story of intransigent young architect Howard Roark, whose integrity was as unyielding as granite...of Dominique Francon, the exquisitely beautiful woman who loved Roark passionately, but married his worst enemy...and of the fanatic denunciation unleashed by an enraged society against a great creator. As fresh today as it was then, Rand's provocative novel presents one of the most challenging ideas in all of fiction--that man's ego is the fountainhead of human progress...<br /><br /><b>\"A writer of great power. She has a subtle and ingenious mind and the capacity of writing brilliantly, beautifully, bitterly...This is the only novel of ideas written by an American woman that I can recall.\"--<i>The New York Times</i></b>",

The series first appeared in French in Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me, a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le XXe Si\u00e8cle  on 10 January 1929. The success of the series saw the serialised strips collected into a series of twenty-four albums, spun into a successful magazine and adapted for film, radio, television and theatre. \n    \n    Set during a largely realistic 20th century, the hero of the series is <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/characters/1770-tintin\">Tintin</a>, a young Belgian reporter. He is aided in his adventures from the beginning by his faithful fox terrier dog <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/characters/33343-snowy\">Snowy</a> (Milou in French). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash, cynical and grumpy <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/characters/3080-captain-archibald-haddock\">Captain Haddock</a>, the highly intelligent but hearing-impaired <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/characters/86001-professeur-tournesol\">Professor Calculus</a> (Professeur Tournesol) and other supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/characters/3083-thomson-thompson\">Thomson and Thompson</a> (Dupont et Dupond). Herg\u00e9 himself features in several of the comics as a background character, as do his assistants in some instances.",

    "description": "This masterpiece of modern comics storytelling brings to vivid life a dark world and an even darker man. Together with inker Klaus Janson and colorist Lynn Varley, writer/artist Frank Miller completely reinvents the legend of Batman in his saga of a near-future Gotham City gone to rot, ten years after the Dark Knight's retirement. <br /><br />Crime runs rampant in the streets, and the man who was Batman is still tortured by the memories of his parents' murders. As civil society crumbles around him, Bruce Wayne's long-suppressed vigilante side finally breaks free of its self-imposed shackles. <br /><br />The Dark Knight returns in a blaze of fury, taking on a whole new generation of criminals and matching their level of violence. He is soon joined by this generation's Robin\u2014a girl named Carrie Kelley, who proves to be just as invaluable as her predecessors.<br /><br />But can Batman and Robin deal with the threat posed by their deadliest enemies, after years of incarceration have made them into perfect psychopaths? And more important, can anyone survive the coming fallout of an undeclared war between the superpowers\u2014or a clash of what were once the world's greatest superheroes?<br /><br />Over fifteen years after its debut, <i>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</i> remains an undisputed classic and one of the most influential stories ever told in the comics medium.<br /><br />Collecting <i>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</i> #1-4",

    "description": "Freedom: a promised land, a battleground, America's cultural bond and fault line. The Declaration of Independence lists liberty among mankind's inalienable rights; the Constitution was framed to secure liberty's blessings. The United States bought the Civil War to bring about a new birth of freedom, World War II for the Four Freedoms, and the Cold War to defend the Free World.In Eric Foner's stirring history, freedom's story unfolds through aspiration and sacrifice, its meaning shaped not only in congressional debates and political treatises, but on plantations and picket lines, in parlors and bedrooms. Its cast of characters ranges from Thomas Jefferson to Margaret Sanger to Franklin D. Roosevelt; from former slaves seeking to breathe real meaning into emancipation to the union organizers, freedom riders, and women's rights advocates of our time.<br /><br />This landmark history shows the story of American freedom to be not a mythic saga but a vital, open-ended tale of accomplishment and failure, a record of a people forever contending over the crucial ideas of their political culture.",

It has been under the Vertigo imprint since issue #63, the month the imprint was introduced. Its central character is the streetwise magician John Constantine. It has been published continuously since January 1988, and is Vertigo's longest running title, the only remaining publication from the imprint's launch.\n    \n    Hellblazer's collection of trade paperbacks is in a rough order as some issues haven't been included or some are out of order (eg <i>The Family Man</i> has 23-24 and 28-33, while <i>Rare Cuts</i> has 11, 25\u201326, 35, 56, and 84). Also, some stories are collected only in non-english editions, like the Spanish and Italians series \"Hellblazer por autor\" (Hellblazer by Author).\n    \n    In 2011 DC/Vertigo began releasing <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/121469\">new edition trades</a>. These new volumes were larger, numbered numerically and contained every issue in chronological order which the previous editions skipped or had collected separately. Many of the new editions contain different issues from the originals.\n    \n    You can also check this <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/258615\">series</a> for the full list of available single issues.\n    \n    <i><b>Constantine series:</b>\n    <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/59856\">Hellblazer</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/121469\">New Editions</a>) (1988) \n    <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/101429\">Constantine</a> (2013)\n    <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/173601\">Constantine: The Hellblazer</a> (2015)\n    <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/188865\">The Hellblazer</a> (2016)\n    </i>",

    "description": "Among Shakespeare's plays, \"Hamlet\" is considered by many his masterpiece. Among actors, the role of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, is considered the jewel in the crown of a triumphant theatrical career. Now Kenneth Branagh plays the leading role and co-directs a brillant ensemble performance. Three generations of legendary leading actors, many of whom first assembled for the Oscar-winning film \"Henry\" V, gather here to perform the rarely heard complete version of the play. This clear, subtly nuanced, stunning dramatization, presented by The Renaissance Theatre Company in association with \"Bbc\" Broadcasting, features such luminaries as Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, Emma Thompson and Christopher Ravenscroft. It combines a full cast with stirring music and sound effects to bring this magnificent Shakespearen classic vividly to life. Revealing new riches with each listening, this production of \"Hamlet\" is an invaluable aid for students, teachers and all true lovers of Shakespeare -- a recording to be treasured for decades to come.",

People die happily, viewing it in endless repetition. The novel <i>Infinite Jest</i> is the story of this addictive entertainment, and in particular how it affects a Boston halfway house for recovering addicts and a nearby tennis academy, whose students have many budding addictions of their own. As the novel unfolds, various individuals, organisations, and governments vie to obtain the master copy of Infinite Jest for their own ends, and the denizens of the tennis school and halfway house are caught up in increasingly desperate efforts to control the movie\u2014as is a cast including burglars, transvestite muggers, scam artists, medical professionals, pro football stars, bookies, drug addicts both active and recovering, film students, political assassins, and one of the most endearingly messed-up families ever captured in a novel.<br /><br />On this outrageous frame hangs an exploration of essential questions about what entertainment is, and why it has come to so dominate our lives; about how our desire for entertainment interacts with our need to connect with other humans; and about what the pleasures we choose say about who we are. Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value. The huge cast and multilevel narrative serve a story that accelerates to a breathtaking, heartbreaking, unfogettable conclusion. It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human and one of those rare books that renew the very idea of what a novel can do.",

Pnin is a tireless lover who writes to his treacherous Liza: \"A genius needs to keep so much in store, and thus cannot offer you the whole of himself as I do.\" Pnin is the focal point of subtle academic conspiracies he cannot begin to comprehend, yet he stages a faculty party to end all faculty parties forever.",

    "description": "History on a grand scale-an enchanting masterpiece that explores the making of one of the world's most vibrant civilizations<br /><br />A People's Tragedy, wrote Eric Hobsbawm, did \"more to help us understand the Russian Revolution than any other book I know.\" Now, in Natasha's Dance, internationally renowned historian Orlando Figes does the same for Russian culture, summoning the myriad elements that formed a nation and held it together.<br /><br />Beginning in the eighteenth century with the building of St. Petersburg-a \"window on the West\"-and culminating with the challenges posed to Russian identity by the Soviet regime, Figes examines how writers, artists, and musicians grappled with the idea of Russia itself-its character, spiritual essence, and destiny. He skillfully interweaves the great works-by Dostoevsky, Stravinsky, and Chagall-with folk embroidery, peasant songs, religious icons, and all the customs of daily life, from food and drink to bathing habits to beliefs about the spirit world. Figes's characters range high and low: the revered Tolstoy, who left his deathbed to search for the Kingdom of God, as well as the serf girl Praskovya, who became Russian opera's first superstar and shocked society by becoming her owner's wife. <br /><br />Like the European-schooled countess Natasha performing an impromptu folk dance in Tolstoy's War and Peace, the spirit of \"Russianness\" is revealed by Figes as rich and uplifting, complex and contradictory-a powerful force that unified a vast country and proved more lasting than any Russian ruler or state.",

    "description": "<i>Out of This Furnace </i>is Thomas Bell\u2019s most compelling achievement.\u00a0 Its story of three generations of an immigrant Slovak family -- the Dobrejcaks -- still stands as a fresh and extraordinary accomplishment.<br /><br />The novel begins in the mid-1880s with the naive blundering career of Djuro Kracha. It tracks his arrival from the old country as he walked from New York to White Haven, his later migration to the steel mills of Braddock, Pennsylvania, and his eventual downfall through foolish financial speculations and an extramarital affair. The second generation is represented by Kracha\u2019s daughter, Mary, who married Mike Dobrejcak, a steel worker. Their decent lives, made desperate by the inhuman working conditions of the mills, were held together by the warm bonds of their family life, and Mike\u2019s political idealism set an example for the children. Dobie Dobrejcak, the third generation, came of age in the 1920s determined not to be sacrificed to the mills. His involvement in the successful unionization of the steel industry climaxed a half-century struggle to establish economic justice for the workers.<br /><br /><i>Out of This Furnace</i> is a document of ethnic heritage and of a violent and cruel period in our history, but it is also a superb story. The writing is strong and forthright, and the novel builds constantly to its triumphantly human conclusion.",

The contributors include A.J. Ayer, Bernard Williams, Martha Nussbaum, Peter Singer, and John Searle, so that the book is not only an introduction to the philosophers of the past, but gives an insight into the view and personalities of some of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century.",

    "description": "C.W. Ceram visualized archeology as a wonderful combination of high adventure, romance, history and scholarship, and this book, a chronicle of man's search for his past, reads like a dramatic narrative. We travel with Heinrich Schliemann as, defying the ridicule of the learned world, he actually unearths the remains of the ancient city of Troy. We share the excitement of Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter as they first glimpse the riches of Tutankhamen's tomb, of George Smith when he found the ancient clay tablets that contained the records of the Biblical Flood. We rediscover the ruined splendors of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the wonders of the ancient wold; of Chichen Itza, the abandoned pyramids of the Maya: and the legendary Labyrinth of tile Minotaur in Crete. Here is much of the history of civilization and the stories of the men who rediscovered it.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Paperback edition.</i>",

    "description": "Six months after the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolution was all but lost. A powerful British force had routed the Americans at New York, occupied three colonies, and advanced within sight of Philadelphia. George Washington lost ninety percent of his army and was driven across the Delaware River. Panic and despair spread through the states. Yet, as David Hackett Fischer recounts in this riveting history, Washington--and many other Americans--refused to let the Revolution die. Even as the British and Germans spread their troops across New Jersey, the people of the colony began to rise against them. George Washington saw his opportunity and seized it. On Christmas night, as a howling nor'easter struck the Delaware Valley, he led his men across the river and attacked the exhausted Hessian garrison at Trenton, killing or capturing nearly a thousand men. A second battle of Trenton followed within days. The Americans held off a counterattack by Lord Cornwallis's best troops, then were almost trapped by the British force. Under cover of night, Washington's men stole behind the enemy and struck them again, defeating a brigade at Princeton. The British were badly shaken. In twelve weeks of winter fighting, their army suffered severe damage, their hold on New Jersey was broken, and their strategy was ruined. Fischer's richly textured narrative reveals the crucial role of contingency in these events. We see how the campaign unfolded in a sequence of difficult choices by many actors, from generals to civilians, on both sides. While British and German forces remained rigid and hierarchical, Americans evolved an open and flexible system that was fundamental to their success. At the same time, they developed an American ethic of warfare that John Adams called \"the policy of humanity,\" and showed that moral victories could have powerful material effects. The startling success of Washington and his compatriots not only saved the faltering American Revolution, but helped to give it new meaning, in a pivotal moment for American history.",

Each book in the series addresses a major historical problem or theme through the study of one particular moment in our past, focusing on how individuals shaped the course of events, while placing those events within a wider historical context. While many of the subjects are familiar, these books offer fresh interpretations based on new sources, new perspectives, or new combinations. The series seeks to unite the old and the new history, combining the insights and techniques of recent historiography with the power of traditional narrative.",

    "description": "A thousand years before the birth of Vlad Taltos, the Dragaeran Empire is a hotbed of intrigue, sorcery, intrigue, swashbuckling adventure, and intrigue. For those who would be heroes, it is a delightful time to be alive--and an easy place to die.<br /><br />Khaavren of the House of Tiassa is a son of landless nobility, possessor of a good sword and \"tolerably well acquainted with its use.\" Along with three loyal friends, he enthusiastically seeks out danger and excitement. But in a realm renowned for repartee and betrayals, where power is as mutable as magic, a young man like Khaavren, newly come from the countryside, had best be wary. His life depends on it. And so does the future of Dragaera.<br /><br />When swordplay beckons, it's all for one--and one for...<i>The Phoenix Guards.</i><br />",

    "description": "\"In 2002, five women are discovered barbarously murdered in Sierra Leone. Reuters Africa correspondent Connie Burns suspects a British mercenary: a man who seems to turn up in every war-torn corner of Africa, whose reputation for violence and brutality is well-founded and widely known. Connie's suspicions that he's using the chaos of war to act out sadistic, misogynistic fantasies, fall on deaf ears - but she's determined to expose him and his secret. The consequences are devastating.\" Connie encounters the man again in Baghdad, but almost immediately she's taken hostage. Released after three desperate days, terrified and traumatized by the experience--fearing that she will never again be the person she once was--Connie retreats to England. She is bent on protecting herself by withholding information about her abduction. But secluded in a remote rented house - where the jealously guarded history of her landlady's family seems to mirror her own fears - she knows that it is only a matter of time before her nightmares become real.",

So when an intelligence agency offers her a luxury Nile cruise if she'll help solve a murder and stop a heist of Egyptian antiquities, all 5'11\" of her takes the plunge. Vicky suspects the authorities really want her to lead them to her missing lover, the art thief and master of disguises she knows only as \"Sir John Smythe.\" And right in the shadow of the Sphinx she spots him. . . with his new flame. Vicky is so furious at this romantic stab-in-the-back, not to mention the sudden arrival of her meddling boss, Herr Dr. Schmidt, that she may overlook a danger as old as the pharaohs and as unchanging. . . a criminal who hides behind a mask of charm while moving in for the kill.",

    "description": "This Edwardian social comedy explores love and prim propriety among an eccentric cast of characters assembled in an Italian <i>pensione</i> and in a corner of Surrey, England.<br /><br />A charming young Englishwoman, Lucy Honeychurch, faints into the arms of a fellow Britisher when she witnesses a murder in a Florentine piazza. Attracted to this man, George Emerson\u2014who is entirely unsuitable and whose father just may be a Socialist\u2014Lucy is soon at war with the snobbery of her class and her own conflicting desires. Back in England, she is courted by a more acceptable, if stifling, suitor and soon realizes she must make a startling decision that will decide the course of her future: she is forced to choose between convention and passion. <br /><br />The enduring delight of this tale of romantic intrigue is rooted in Forster\u2019s colorful characters, including outrageous spinsters, pompous clergymen, and outspoken patriots. Written in 1908, <b>A Room with a View</b> is one of E. M. Forster\u2019s earliest and most celebrated works.",

    "description": "This is the story of Moses Herzog, a great sufferer, joker, mourner, and charmer. Although his life steadily disintegrates around him - he has failed as a writer and teacher, as a father, and has lost the affection of his wife to his best friend - Herzog sees himself as a survivor, both of his private disasters and those of the age. He writes unsent letters to friends and enemies, colleagues and famous people, revealing his wry perception of the world around him, and the innermost secrets of his heart.",

    "description": "Anne Lamott claims the two best prayers she knows are: \"Help me, help me, help me\" and \"Thank you, thank you, thank you.\" She has a friend whose morning prayer each day is \"Whatever,\" and whose evening prayer is \"Oh, well.\" Anne thinks of Jesus as \"Casper the friendly savior\" and describes God as \"one crafty mother.\" Despite--or because of--her irreverence, faith is a natural subject for Anne Lamott. Since Operating Instructions and Bird by Bird, her fans have been waiting for her to write the book that explained how she came to the big-hearted, grateful, generous faith that she so often alluded to in her two earlier nonfiction books. The people in Anne Lamott's real life are like beloved characters in a favorite series for her readers--her friend Pammy, her son, Sam, and the many funny and wise folks who attend her church are all familiar. And Traveling Mercies is a welcome return to those lives, as well as an introduction to new companions Lamott treats with the same candor, insight, and tenderness. Lamott's faith isn't about easy answers, which is part of what endears her to believers as well as nonbelievers. Against all odds, she came to believe in God and then, even more miraculously, in herself. As she puts it, \"My coming to faith did not start with a leap but rather a series of staggers.\" At once tough, personal, affectionate, wise, and very funny, Traveling Mercies tells in exuberant detail how Anne Lamott learned to shine the light of faith on the darkest part of ordinary life, exposing surprising pockets of meaning and hope.

    "description": "T. C. Boyle is one of the most inventive and wickedly funny short story writers at work today. Over the course of twenty-five years, Boyle has built up a body of short fiction that is remarkable in its range, richness, and exuberance. His stories have won accolades for their irony and black humor, for their verbal pyrotechnics, for their fascination with everything bizarre and queasy, and for the razor-sharp way in which they dissect America's obsession with image and materialism. Gathered together here are all of the stories that have appeared in his four previous collections, as well as seven that have never before appeared in book form. Together they comprise a book of small treasures, a definitive gift for Boyle fans and for every reader ready to discover the \"ferocious, delicious imagination\" (Los Angeles Times Book Review) of a \"vibrant sensibility fully engaged with American society\" (The New York Times).",

    "description": "In prehistoric times, our ancestors began building shelters and planting crops in order to escape from nature's harsh realities. Today, we flee urban dangers for the safer, reconfigured world of suburban lawns and parks. According to geographer Yi-Fu Tuan, people have always sought to escape in one way or another, sometimes foolishly, often creatively and ingeniously. Glass-tower cities, suburbs, shopping malls, Disneyland\u2014all are among the most recent monuments in our efforts to escape the constraints and uncertainties of life\u2014ultimately, those imposed by nature. \"What cultural product,\" Tuan asks, \"is not escape?\" In his new book, the capstone of a celebrated career, Tuan shows that escapism is an inescapable component of human thought and culture.",

Mark Musa's blank verse rendition of the poet's journey through the circles of Hell re-creates for the modern reader the rich meanings that Dante's poem had for his contemporaries. Musa's introduction and commentaries on each of the cantos brilliantly illuminate the text.",

Alinsky writes both practically and philosophically, never wavering from his belief that the American dream can only be achieved by an active democratic citizenship. First published in 1946 and updated in 1969 with a new introduction and afterword, this classic volume is a bold call to action that still resonates today.",

It's time we learned how to see through the rhetoric, faulty reasoning, and misinformation that we're subjected to from morning to night by talk-radio hosts, op-ed columnists, advertisers, self-help gurus, business \"thinkers,\" and, of course, politicians. And no one is better equipped to show us how than award-winning philosopher Jamie Whyte.<br /><br />In <i>Crimes Against Logic</i> Whyte take us on a fast-paced, ruthlessly funny romp through the mulligan stew of can, folderol, and bogus logic served up in the media, at the office, and even in your own home. Applying his laserlike wit to dozens of timely examples, Whyte cuts through the haze of facts, figures, and double-talk and gets at the real truth behind what they're telling us.<br /><br />\"An incisive philosopher.\"<br />--<b>\n  <i>Sunday Telegraph</i>\n</b>",

Her personal life, including a\u00a0romantic relationship with\u00a0her publisher, Norman Warne,\u00a0and her significant achievements outside of children's literature remain largely unknown. In Linda Lear's enchanting new biography,\u00a0we get the life story of this incredible, funny, and independent woman. As one of the first female naturalists in the world, Potter brought the beauty and importance of nature back into the imagination at a time when plunder was more popular than preservation.\u00a0Through her art she sought to encourage conservation and change the world. With never before seen illustrations and intimate detail,\u00a0Lear goes beyond our perrenial fascination with Potter as a writer and illustrator of children's books, and\u00a0delves deeply into the life of a most unusual and gifted\u00a0woman--one whose art was timeless, and whose generosity left an indelible imprint on the countryside.",

It says what most scientists and politicians are afraid to say about what research can and, perhaps more importantly, cannot deliver on topics ranging from sexuality, race and genetic modification to stem cells, cloning, modern medicine, fertility treatment, creationism and bioterrorism.<br /><br />Having worked at the heart of government science, at the most prestigious science publishing company in the world, and in one of the world's leading biology institutions the author has a unique view of the politics, culture and reach of science. He illustrates how we are facing dangerous times where political agendas and public misunderstanding are hobbling truly novel work and hence calls for wide reaching changes in science education, funding, publishing and promulgation.<br /><br />",

    "description": "An unprecedented account of life in Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone, a walled-off enclave of towering plants, posh villas, and sparkling swimming pools that was the headquarters for the American occupation of Iraq.<br /><br /><i>The Washington Post</i>\u2019s former Baghdad bureau chief Rajiv Chandrasekaran takes us with him into the Zone: into a bubble, cut off from wartime realities, where the task of reconstructing a devastated nation competed with the distractions of a Little America\u2014a half-dozen bars stocked with cold beer, a disco where women showed up in hot pants, a movie theater that screened shoot-\u2019em-up films, an all-you-could-eat buffet piled high with pork, a shopping mall that sold pornographic movies, a parking lot filled with shiny new SUVs, and a snappy dry-cleaning service\u2014much of it run by Halliburton. Most Iraqis were barred from entering the Emerald City for fear they would blow it up.<br /><br /> Drawing on hundreds of interviews and internal documents, Chandrasekaran tells the story of the people and ideas that inhabited the Green Zone during the occupation, from the imperial viceroy L. Paul Bremer III to the fleet of twentysomethings hired to implement the idea that Americans could build a Jeffersonian democracy in an embattled Middle Eastern country.<br /><br /> In the vacuum of postwar planning, Bremer ignores what Iraqis tell him they want or need and instead pursues irrelevant neoconservative solutions\u2014a flat tax, a sell-off of Iraqi government assets, and an end to food rationing. His underlings spend their days drawing up pie-in-the-sky policies, among them a new traffic code and a law protecting microchip designs, instead of rebuilding looted buildings and restoring electricity production. His almost comic initiatives anger the locals and help fuel the insurgency.<br /><br /> Chandrasekaran details Bernard Kerik\u2019s ludicrous attempt to train the Iraqi police and brings to light lesser known but typical travesties: the case of the twenty-four-year-old who had never worked in finance put in charge of reestablishing Baghdad\u2019s stock exchange; a contractor with no previous experience paid millions to guard a closed airport; a State Department employee forced to bribe Americans to enlist their help in preventing Iraqi weapons scientists from defecting to Iran; Americans willing to serve in Iraq screened by White House officials for their views on <i>Roe v. Wade; </i>people<i> </i>with prior expertise in the Middle East excluded in favor of lesser-qualified Republican Party loyalists. Finally, he describes Bremer\u2019s ignominious departure in 2004, fleeing secretly in a helicopter two days ahead of schedule.<br /><br /> This is a startling portrait of an Oz-like place where a vital aspect of our government\u2019s folly in Iraq played out. It is a book certain to be talked about for years to come.",

    "description": "\"Gripping, heartbreaking reading...The interweaving of Hemingway's story, the students' narratives of terror and Huntley's own tales of discovery make for a book that is stirring and nearly impossible to put down.\"<br /><br />In August 2000, Paula Huntley's husband took a leave of absence from his teaching post at a law school, and she resigned from her marketing job of thirteen years. Huntley's husband had signed on with the American Bar Association to help rebuild Kosovo's legal system. Not quite sure how she could be of any service in a country that had suffered so much, Huntley found a position at a private school teaching English to a group of Kosovo Albanians. In this inspiring diary of her experiences in Kosovo, Huntley describes the deep friendships she formed with her students and the remarkable book club that they created . . .<br /><br />One day in a bookstore in Prishtina, Huntley stumbled upon a copy of Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea and--judging that it was just the right reading level and length--she made copies of it for the group. Despite lingering concerns that this quintessential American writer so notorious for his machismo might not resonate, the story of the old man's struggle to bring in his big fish touched them deeply. So deeply in fact that, though the group went on to read other great American writers, a name for their club was born: The Hemingway Book Club of Kosova.<br /><br />This book reveals both the fragility and strength of the human spirit. Neither a journalist nor a historian, Huntley describes her students' experiences during the war and the intimacy of the bond that she formed with them with a rare purity and directness. A vision of great hope, The Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo reveals the power of human connection to bring about healing in even the most war-torn circumstances.",

    "description": "<strong>David Sedaris plays in the snow with his sisters. He goes on vacation with his family. He gets a job selling drinks. He attends his brother's wedding. He mops his sister's floor. He gives directions to a lost traveler. He eats a hamburger. He has his blood sugar tested. It all sounds so normal, doesn't it? In his newest collection of essays, David Sedaris lifts the corner of ordinary life, revealing the absurdity teeming below its surface. His world is alive with obscure desires and hidden motives -- a world where forgiveness is automatic and an argument can be the highest form of love. Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is another unforgettable collection from one of the wittiest and most original writers at work today.</strong>",

    "description": "An instant classic when first published in 1992 and now substantially revised and expanded, Lend Me Your Ears collects more than two hundred of history's outstanding instances of oratorical eloquence. They are selected, arranged, and introduced by William Safire, considered by many to be the most influential political columnist in America, himself a former speechwriter and language scholar. The book is arranged by theme and occasion, and each speech is expertly introduced by the editor, who places the speech's occasion in historical context and analyzes the particular techniques that convey its force and effect. William Safire enlivens many of these introductions with personal anecdotes of the circumstances of the speechmaker and the speech. His introduction is a brisk, effective short course in how to make a great speech - with a cornucopia of examples to follow.",

Fleeing from poverty and hardship, he falls in with a criminal street gang who will not let him go, however hard he tries to escape.<br /><br />One of the most swiftly moving and unified of Charles Dickens\u2019s great novels, <i>Oliver Twist</i> is also famous for its re-creation\u2013through the splendidly realized figures of Fagin, Nancy, the Artful Dodger, and the evil Bill Sikes\u2013of the vast London underworld of pickpockets, thieves, prostitutes, and abandoned children. Victorian critics took Dickens to task for rendering this world in such a compelling, believable way, but readers over the last 150 years have delivered an alternative judgment by making this story of the orphaned Oliver Twist one of its author\u2019s most loved works.",

I washed on a normal basis and still had good credit.\u201d</i><br /><br /> Introducing Laurie Notaro, the leader of the Idiot Girls\u2019 Action-Adventure Club. Every day she fearlessly rises from bed to defeat the evil machinations of dolts, dimwits, and creepy boyfriends\u2014and that\u2019s before she even puts on a bra.<br /><br /> For the past ten years, Notaro has been entertaining Phoenix newspaper readers with her wildly amusing autobiographical exploits and unique life experiences. She writes about a world of hourly-wage jobs that require absolutely no skills, a mother who hands down judgments more forcefully than anyone seated on the Supreme Court, horrific high school reunions, and hangovers that leave her surprised that she woke up in the first place.<br /><br /> The misadventures of Laurie and her fellow Idiot Girls (\u201ctoo cool to be in the Smart Group\u201d) unfold in a world that everyone will recognize but no one has ever described so hilariously. She delivers the goods: life as we all know it.",

    "description": "Available for the first time in the United States, <i>Cause Celeb</i> is the hilarious debut novel by British literary sensation Helen Fielding. With the same wit and candor that shot <a href=\"http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?isbn=014028009X\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n  <i>Bridget Jones's Diary</i>\n</a> and <a href=\"http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?isbn=0670892963\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n  <i>Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason</i>\n</a> to the top of bestseller lists and forever altered the vocabulary of dating, Fielding executes a remarkable spoof on the altruistic endeavors of commoners and celebrities alike as they unite to combat the horror of famine and neglect in Africa. Populated by larger-than-life characters from London's West End and the unsung heroes toiling anonymously on the Continent, <i>Cause Celeb</i> is a cunning and poignant tale that discloses the romantic underpinnings of life and love in the 21st century.<br /><p><br />Rosie Richardson, a frothy young woman trapped in the cauldron of the publishing world, finds herself involved in a dysfunctional relationship with TV personality Oliver Marchant, a Teflon-coated Romeo who slips in and out of her life with greater frequency than she'd like. Disenchanted with their glamorous lifestyle, Rosie packs her bags and (quite literally) heads for the hills, embarking on a personal odyssey through the majestic deserts of Africa to the fictional state of Nambula, where each day's sunrise brings a daunting challenge. <br /></p><p><br />Upon arrival in the sparse refugee camp, Rosie immediately gets a sense of just how eccentric some of her new neighbors are. Muhammed, a local go-between with a flair for melodrama, the burly Irish doctor O'Rourke, and two seasoned nurses are all catalysts for the story who keep spirits alive and send emotions on a roller-coaster ride. When a carpet of locusts wreaks havoc among vestiges of the season's last crops, disease and starvation become a palpable threat that plagues the proud refugees of Nambula with fear. <br /></p><p><br />But stubborn government regimes turn a blind eye to the dangers facing the village, the relief workers' pleas for food and assistance are ignored, and fever and calamity run rampant, forcing Rosie to return to London and enlist the help of her former lover and the motley crew of friends they once shared. In a final, inspired act of desperation, the former publicity flak miraculously pulls off an international appeal with results that far surpass anything she had imagined. <br /></p><p><br />With a winning combination of pathos and humor, Fielding suggests that the real voyage of discovery is not simply in the quest for new landscapes, but in having new eyes to view them with. Ultimately, Rosie does find the peace of mind and passion she so desperately sought, and the success of her cause adds substance to her life and a depth to her character she had never suspected. Like the Bridget Jones novels, <i>Cause Celeb</i> is an easy, enjoyable read. But despite its seeming frivolity, the book paints an insightful and sanguine portrait of modern-day philanthropy. It's just that in the world according to Helen Fielding, even saving lives can be cause for merriment.<br /></p><p>\n  <br /><i>--Lauren Foster</i>\n</p>",

    "description": "<i>Limbo</i> is a thought-provoking treatise on the lasting consequences of class mobility in America. Drawing on his own story as well as on dozens more from individuals who share his experience, award-winning journalist Alfred Lubrano sheds light on the predicament of some 13 million Americans: reconciling their blue-collar upbringing with the white-collar world they now inhabit.<p>The profiles here show a remarkable consistency of emotion and experience across a diverse demographic that crosses all boundaries of sex, race, and religion. Opening a long-awaited dialogue, <i>Limbo</i> reflects the reality of a unique class struggling with an all-American brand of cultural isolation. There is something for everyone in these honest and eloquent stories of life in our modern meritocracy.</p>",

    "description": "The critically acclaimed novel of a compelling love affair and the decline of a once prosperous city .<br /><br />The birthplace of rock 'n' roll, Cleveland was an economic powerhouse and America's sixth-largest city in the late 1940s. By 1969, it had dropped to twelfth. In the summer of 1948, fourteen-year-old David Zielinsky can look forward to a job at the docks, the only way to make a living on his side of the city. Across the river is twelve-year-old Anne O'Connor, daughter of the reigning political boss of Cuyahoga County. In this richly entertaining novel, the two will meet and fall in love, and for twenty turbulent years, as Cleveland falls from grace, they will be consumed by a fiery, star-crossed romance. A natural-born storyteller, Mark Winegardner charts the demise of this fascinating city, artfully weaving in such real-life Clevelanders as Eliot Ness, Alan Freed, and Carl Stokes. A saga reminiscent of the best writing of E. L. Doctorow, Tom Wolfe, and John Dos Passos, Crooked River Burning is masterfully crafted and vastly entertaining-a great American novel in the truest sense. <br /><br />",

    "description": "Tim Cahill writes in his introduction to The Best American Travel Writing 2006, \"'Story' is the essence of the travel essay. Stories are the way we organize the chaos in our lives, orchestrate voluminous factual material, and -- if we are very good -- shed some light on the human condition.\" Here are twenty-six pieces that showcase the best travel writing from 2005, filled with \"keen observations that transform ordinary journeys into extraordinary ones\" (Library Journal). <br /><br />Mark Jenkins journeys into a forgotten valley in Afghanistan, Kevin Fedarko takes a wild ride through the rapids of the Grand Canyon, and Christopher Solomon reports on the newest fad to hit South Korea: downhill skiing. For David Sedaris, a seemingly routine domestic flight is cause for a witty rumination on modern airline travel. Alain de Botton describes the discreet charms of Zurich, and Ian Frazier recalls leaving the small Midwestern town he called home. Michael Paterniti gives a touching portrait of the world's tallest man -- eight and a half feet and growing, while P.J. O'Rourke visits an airplane manufacturer to see firsthand how the French make the world's biggest passenger plane. George Saunders is dazzled by a trip to the \"Vegas of the Middle East,\" Rolf Potts takes on tantric yoga for dilettantes, and Sean Flynn documents a seedier side of travel -- the newest hotspot in the international sex trade. <br /><br />Culled from a wide variety of publications, these stories, as Cahill writes, all \"touched me in one way or another, changed an attitude, made me laugh aloud, or provided fuel for my dreams. I wish the reader similar joys.\"",

He offers a vivid, historical tour of our willingness to suspend reason in favor of religious beliefs\u2014even when these beliefs inspire the worst human atrocities. While warning against the encroachment of organized religion into world politics, Harris draws on insights from neuroscience, philosophy, and Eastern mysticism to deliver a call for a truly modern foundation for ethics and spirituality that is both secular and humanistic.<br /><br />Winner of the 2005 PEN/Martha Albrand Award for Nonfiction.",

    "description": "In <i>Medieval Technology and Social Change</i>, Lynn White considers the effects of technological innovation on the societies of medieval Europe: the slow collapse of feudalism with the development of machines and tools that introduced factories in place of cottage industries, and the development of the manorial system with the introduction of new kinds of plows and new methods of crop rotation. One invention of particular import, writes White, was the stirrup, which in turn introduced heavy, long-range cavalry to the medieval battlefield. The development thus escalated small-scale conflict to \"shock combat.\" Cannons and flamethrowers followed, as did more peaceful inventions, such as watermills and reapers.",

    "description": "With the stock market breaking records almost daily, leaving longtime market analysts shaking their heads and revising their forecasts, a study of the concept of risk seems quite timely. Peter Bernstein has written a comprehensive history of man's efforts to understand risk and probability, beginning with early gamblers in ancient Greece, continuing through the 17th-century French mathematicians Pascal and Fermat and up to modern chaos theory. Along the way he demonstrates that understanding risk underlies everything from game theory to bridge-building to winemaking.",

    "description": "From #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Philippa Gregory comes the stunning first novel of a thrilling trilogy about the Lacey family, and the captivating woman at the heart of a power-hungry estate willing to go to any means to protect her family name.<br /><br />Beatrice Lacey, as strong-minded as she is beautiful, refuses to conform to the social customs of her time. Destined to lose her heritage and beloved Wideacre estate once she is wed, Beatrice will use any means necessary to protect her ancestral name. Seduction, betrayal, even murder--Beatrice's passion is without apology or conscience. \"She is a Lacey of Wideacre,\" her father warns, \"and whatever she does, however she behaves, will always be fitting.\" Yet even as Beatrice's scheming seems about to yield her dream, she is haunted by the one living person who knows the extent of her plans...and her capacity for evil.<br /><br />Sumptuously set in Georgian England from the \"queen of royal fiction\" (<i>USA TODAY</i>), <i>Wideacre</i> is intensely gripping, rich in texture, and full of color and authenticity. It is a saga as irresistible in its singular magic as its heroine.",

    "description": "<div>In 1996, Alan Sokal published an essay in the hip intellectual magazine <i>Social Text</i> parodying the scientific but impenetrable lingo of contemporary theorists. Here, Sokal teams up with Jean Bricmont to expose the abuse of scientific concepts in the writings of today's most fashionable postmodern thinkers. From Jacques Lacan and Julia Kristeva to Luce Irigaray and Jean Baudrillard, the authors document the errors made by some postmodernists using science to bolster their arguments and theories. Witty and closely reasoned, <i>Fashionable Nonsense</i> dispels the notion that scientific theories are mere \"narratives\" or social constructions, and explored the abilities and the limits of science to describe the conditions of existence.<br /></div>",

This classic of lesbian eroticism is Jane Rule's first novel.<br /><br />Set in the late 1950s, this is the story of Evelyn Hall, an English professor, who goes to Reno to obtain a divorce and put an end to her disastrous 16-year marriage. While staying at a boarding house to establish her six-week residency requirement she meets Ann Childs, a casino worker and fifteen years her junior. Physically, they are remarkably alike and eventually have an affair and begin the struggle to figure out just how a relationship between two women can last. Desert of the Heart examines the conflict between convention and freedom and the ways in which the characters try to resolve the conflict.",

At once eye-opening, thought-provoking, and surprisingly fresh and moving, Nader\u2019s <em>The Seventeen Traditions</em> is a celebration of uniquely American ethics certain to appeal to fans of Mitch Albom, Tim Russert, and Anna Quindlen\u2014an unexpected and most welcome gift from this fearlessly committed reformer and outspoken critic of corruption in government and society. In a time of widespread national dissatisfaction and disillusionment that has given rise to new dissent characterized by the Occupy Wall Street movement, the liberal icon shows us how every American can learn from <em>The Seventeen Traditions</em> and, by embracing them, help bring about meaningful and necessary change.<br />",

Ben\u2019s one-time best friend, Peter Aaron, begins to retrospectively investigate the transformation that led Ben from his enviable stable life, to one of a recluse. Both were once intelligent, yet struggling novelists until Ben\u2019s near-death experience falling from a fire escape triggers a tumble in which he becomes withdrawn and disturbed, living alone and building bombs in a far-off cabin. That is, until he mysteriously disappears, leaving behind only a manuscript titled <i>Leviathan</i>, pages rustling in the wind.",

    "description": "The ostensible purpose of a library is to preserve the printed word. But for fifty years our country's libraries\u2014including the Library of Congress\u2014have been doing just the opposite, destroying hundreds of thousands of historic newspapers and replacing them with microfilm copies that are difficult to read, lack all the color and quality of the original paper and illustrations, and deteriorate with age.<br /><br />With meticulous detective work and Baker's well-known explanatory power, <i>Double Fold</i> reveals a secret history of microfilm lobbyists, former CIA agents, and warehouses where priceless archives are destroyed with a machine called a guillotine. Baker argues passionately for preservation, even cashing in his own retirement account to save one important archive\u2014all twenty tons of it. Written the brilliant narrative style that Nicholson Baker fans have come to expect, <i>Double Fold</i> is a persuasive and often devastating book that may turn out to be <i>The Jungle</i> of the American library system.",

    "description": "<i>Measure for Measure</i> is among the most passionately discussed of Shakespeare\u2019s plays. In it, a duke temporarily removes himself from governing his city-state, deputizing a member of his administration, Angelo, to enforce the laws more rigorously. Angelo chooses as his first victim Claudio, condemning him to death because he impregnated Juliet before their marriage.<br /><br />Claudio\u2019s sister Isabella, who is entering a convent, pleads for her brother\u2019s life. Angelo attempts to extort sex from her, but Isabella preserves her chastity. The duke, in disguise, eavesdrops as she tells her brother about Angelo\u2019s behavior, then offers to ally himself with her against Angelo.",

    "description": "<i>What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us</i>. To put things simply: If women today were happy, \"Ally McBeal\" would not be such a huge TV hit \u0097 a television phenomenon that not only provokes endless discussion nationwide but also has the distinction of mention in a Time Magazine cover story addressing the state of feminism.<p>The anxiety-riddled character \"Ally McBeal\" has tapped into something simmering beneath the surface of today's professional, \"successful\" women. It's called misery. Worse, it's called misery without a comprehensible origin. It is this odd, pervasive unhappiness that Danielle Crittenden confronts in her fascinating, enlightening book <i>What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us</i>.</p><p>The premise of <i>What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us</i> is that with all of the success of feminism \u0097 all of the doors that have been opened, all of the new freedoms women of this generation enjoy \u0097 \"we may have inadvertently also smashed the foundations necessary for our happiness.\" Crittenden does not in any way suggest women revert back to the pre-<i>Feminine Mystique</i> days of suburban housewife malaise, but she does confront the possibility that there might have been some crucial good in many of the old patterns of living that women today reject entirely. Crittenden explains that women in the '90s have \"heeded their mother's advice: Do something with your life; don't depend upon a man to take care of you; don't make the same mistakes I did. So they have made different mistakes. They are the women who postponed marriage and childbirth to pursue their careers only tofindthemselves at 35 still single and baby-crazy, with no husband in sight. They are the unwed mothers who now depend on the state to provide what the fathers of their children won't \u0097 a place to live and an income to raise their kids on. They are the eighteen-year-old girls who believed they could lead the unfettered sexual lives of men, only to have ended up in an abortion clinic or attending grade twelve English while eight months pregnant. They are the new brides who understand that when a couple promises to stay together 'forever,' they have little better than a 50-50 chance of sticking to it. They are the female partners at law firms who thought they'd made provisions for everything about their career \u0097 except for that sudden, unexpected moment when they find their insides shredding the first day they return from maternity leave, having placed their infants in a stranger's arms.\"</p><p><i>What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us</i> examines the new problems in today's society and outlines the erroneous ways of thinking that created these problems. With a lighthearted tone and good humor throughout, Crittenden intelligently leads readers through an exploration of love, marriage, motherhood, and even aging. Her examination of dating among women in their 20s and 30s is fascinating, harsh \u0097 and yes, depressing. She paints a stark portrait of women in their 20s who brush aside sincere suitors because they believe they're too young to consider marriage, only to discover in their mid-30s that the crowd beating down their door has thinned considerably \u0097 and perhaps irrevocably. There is perhaps no more salient truth in Crittenden's book than her statement, \"It is usually at precisely this moment \u0097 when a single woman looks up from her work and realizes she's ready to take on family life \u0097 that men make themselves most absent.\" Further, it is impossible to deny that in terms of sexual appeal, men have a longer shelf life. A successful man can attract women of any age well into his 50s, 60s...or beyond. They can father children well into old age. And according to Crittenden, \"this disparity in sexual staying power is something feminists rather recklessly overlooked when they urged women to abandon marriage and domesticity in favor of autonomy and self-fulfillment outside the home.\"</p><p>According to Crittenden, even when a young woman today manages to get married, she is most likely not headed down the path to wedded bliss. In striving so furiously not to be taken for granted as wives were in previous generations, women today often err too far in the opposite direction. Crittenden makes ironic mention of Gloria Steinem's remark that women have become \"the husbands we wanted to marry\"; Crittenden suggests that perhaps women today are more likely to resemble the husbands we left behind: \"balky, self-absorbed, and supremely sure that our needs should come before anyone else's.\" Crittenden warns that a sense of entitlement devoid of compromise is not likely to lead women into enduring, happy unions.</p><p>But the most significant arena of mixed messages is the realm of motherhood. Crittenden is unflinching in her look at the tug of war between work responsibility and the job of motherhood. She explores the myriad decisions and conflicts that arise upon the birth of a child. Some women are eager to return to work but feel guilty leaving their child. Some women are desperate to remain at home with their child but cannot afford to do so. Other women would prefer to remain home with their child, and can afford to do so, but are wary of leaving their jobs because if they ever need to return to the workforce they will have lost their foothold. Crittenden is critical of our culture's pervasive attitude that suggests a woman is not \"doing anything\" once she steps out of the workforce \u0097 an attitude that could only hold weight in a society such as ours in which \"the virtues of work have been so inflated that we can no longer appreciate anything that's not accompanied by a paycheck.\" And as for the idea that work is a liberating alternative to the drudgery of housework and childrearing, Crittenden suggests that the number of people who have interesting, fulfilling jobs are in the great minority. Crittenden calls for women to reevaluate what they have been socialized to believe \u0097 that work offers a more defining sense of self than raising children.</p><p>So, what did our mothers never tell us? Maybe they did not tell us what Crittenden explains very carefully: Women can't have it both ways. They probably can't have \"it all.\" Life, relationships, careers...all are full of compromises that are natural and not necessarily a threat to who we are as individuals. Crittenden asserts that \"If we wish to live for ourselves and think only about ourselves, we will manage to retain our independence but little else.\"</p><p><i>What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us</i> offers a revised perspective on womanhood that is truly liberating. <br />\u0097 Isabel Rifkin</p>",

    "description": "The nine stories in Link's second collection are the spitting image of those in her acclaimed debut, Stranger Things Happen: effervescent blends of quirky humor and pathos that transform stock themes of genre fiction into the stuff of delicate lyrical fantasy. In \"Stone Animals,\" a house's haunting takes the unusual form of hordes of rabbits that camp out nightly on the front lawn. This proves just one of several benign but inexplicable phenomena that begin to pull apart the family newly moved into the house as surely as a more sinister supernatural influence might. The title story beautifully captures the unpredictable potential of teenage lives through its account of a group of adolescent schoolfriends whose experiences subtly parallel events in a surreal TV fantasy series. Zombies serve as the focus for a young man's anxieties about his future in \"Some Zombie Contingency Plans\" and offer suggestive counterpoint to the lives of two convenience store clerks who serve them in \"The Hortlak.\" Not only does Link find fresh perspectives from which to explore familiar premises, she also forges ingenious connections between disparate images and narrative approaches to suggest a convincing alternate logic that shapes the worlds of her highly original fantasies.<br /><br />Contents:<br />The Faery Handbag (2004)<br />The Hortlak (2003)<br />The Cannon (2003)<br />Stone Animals (2004)<br />Catskin (2003)<br />Some Zombie Contingency Plans (2005)<br />The Great Divorce (2005)<br />Magic for Beginners (2005)<br />Lull (2002)",

    "description": "An unusual love story about a little librarian on Cape Cod and the tallest boy in the world, <i>The Giant's House</i> is the magical first novel from the author of the 1994 ALA Notable collection Here's Your Hat, What's Your Hurry.<br /><br />The year is 1950, and in a small town on Cape Cod twenty-six-year-old librarian Peggy Cort feels like love and life have stood her up. Until the day James Carlson Sweatt--the \"over tall\" eleven-year-old boy who's the talk of the town--walks into her library and changes her life forever. Two misfits whose lonely paths cross at the circulation desk, Peggy and James are odd candidates for friendship, but nevertheless they soon find their lives entwined in ways that neither one could have predicted. In James, Peggy discovers the one person who's ever really understood her, and as he grows--six foot five at age twelve, then seven feet, then eight--so does her heart and their most singular romance. <br /><br /><i>The Giant's House</i> is an unforgettably tender and quirky novel about learning to welcome the unexpected miracle, and about the strength of choosing to love in a world that gives no promises, and no guarantees.",

Absorbing and complex, it chronicles the family\u2019s saga from the economic panic of 1873 through the dramatic rise of American industry and trade unionism, through waves of immigration, class conflict, natural disaster, World War I, and Pearl Harbor. In 1945 it was made into a major motion picture starring Greer Garson and Gregory Peck.<br /> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This reissue features a new foreword by noted steel industry historian John Hoerr, author of <i>And the Wolf Finally Came, </i>who places the novel in context as a classic depiction of twentieth-century America.",

    "description": "<i>Cloud Atlas</i> begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . . Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.<br /><br />But the story doesn\u2019t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.<br /><br />As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, <i>Cloud Atlas</i> is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.",

    "description": "The Silver Spoon is the most influential and successful cookbook in Italy. Originally published in 1950, it became an instant classic. Considered to be essential in every household, it is still one of the most popular wedding presents today. <p>The Silver Spoon was conceived and published by Domus, the design and architectural magazine famously directed by Gi\u00f2 Ponti from the 1920's to the 1970's. <br /><br />A group of cooking experts was commissioned to collect hundreds of traditional recipes from the different Italian regions and make them available for the first time to a wider audience. In the process, they updated ingredients, quantities and methods to suit contemporary tastes and customs, at the same time preserving the memory of ancient recipes for future generations. They also included modern recipes from some of the most famous Italian chefs, resulting in a style of cooking that appeals to the gourmet as well as the occasional cook <br /><br />A comprehensive and lively book, its simple and user-friendly format makes it both accessible and a pleasure to read. It provides an introduction to every course, and an explanation of the main type of ingredients. Never translated before, The Silver Spoon has now been adapted to an international market, with every recipe checked for suitability, measurements converted and methods rewritten to accommodate cultural differences, yet maintaining the authenticity of real Italian cooking. <br /><br />The new layout emphasizes its contemporary appeal and the colour coding of each section simplifies the process of cross-referencing ingredients and methods. A section with original menus from the 15 most famous Italian chefs of the last 50 years has been expanded to include original menus from Italian celebrity chefs working outside Italy. <br /><br />This is a substantial and prestigious cookbook that will share the bookshelves with other titles such as The Joy of Cooking and Larousse Gastronomique, another classic of national cuisine. With over 2,000 recipes illustrated with specially commissioned artwork and photography, the book is destined to become a classic in the Italian cooking booklist for the international market.</p>",

    "description": "Getting started with SAS is easy with The Little SAS Book. This friendly, easy-to-read guide gently introduces you to the most commonly used features of SAS software plus a whole lot more! Authors Lora Delwiche and Susan Slaughter have revised the text to include concepts of the Output Delivery System; the STYLE= option in the PRINT, REPORT, and TABULATE procedures; ODS HTML, RTF, PRINTER, and OUTPUT destinations; PROC REPORT; more on PROC TABULATE; exporting data; and the colon modifier for informats. You'll find clear and concise explanations of basic SAS concepts (such as DATA and PROC steps), inputting data, modifying and combining data sets, summarizing and presenting data, basic statistical procedures, and debugging SAS programs. Each topic is presented in a self-contained, two-page layout complete with examples and graphics. This format enables new users to get up and running quickly, while the examples allow you to type in the program and see it work!",

    "description": "A delightful, delicious, and best-selling account of the gustatory pleasures to be found throughout France, from the beloved author of <i>A Year in Provence</i>.<br /><br />The French celebrate food and drink more than any other people, and Peter Mayle shows us just how contagious their enthusiasm can be. We visit the Foire aux Escargots. We attend a truly French marathon, where the beverage of choice is Ch\ufffdteau Lafite-Rothschild rather than Gatorade. We search out the most pungent cheese in France, and eavesdrop on a heated debate on the perfect way to prepare an omelet. We even attend a Catholic mass in the village of Richerenches, a sacred event at which thanks are given for the aromatic, mysterious, and breathtakingly expensive black truffle. With Mayle as our charming guide, we come away satisfied (if a little hungry), and with a sudden desire to book a flight to France at once.",

    "description": "A whole new feast of adventures, discoveries, hilarities, and culinary treats, liberally seasoned with a joyous mix of Gallic characters.<br /><br />After trying--what folly!--to live in other places, Peter Mayle is back in his beloved Provence. He celebrates his homecoming by sharing with us a whole new feast of adventures, discoveries, hilarities, and culinary treats, liberally seasoned with a joyous mix of Gallic characters. The pauses for refreshment include an unforgettable meal in a converted gas station, a rendezvous with the very best bouillabaisse, and visits to eventful weekly markets.<br /><br />But there is life after lunch, and we also discover a school for noses in Haute Provence, a gardener who grows black tomatoes, the secret of the oversexed butcher, a celebration of Alowine (Halloween) Provence-style, and the genetic effects of two thousand years of fois gras. There is a memorable tour of Marseille, a comprehensive lesson on olive oil, a search for the perfect cork-screw, and invaluable recommendations for splendid local cheeses, wines, honey, bread, country restaurants, and off-the-beaten-track places to stay.<br /><br />Never has Peter Mayle written with more unabashed pleasure about his heaven on earth.",

    "description": "For over fifty years, <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</i> has been the definitive book on the subject for American readers. Featuring 524 delicious recipes, in its pages home cooks will find something for everyone, from seasoned experts to beginners who love good food and long to reproduce the savory delights of French cuisine, from historic Gallic masterpieces to the seemingly artless perfection of a dish of spring-green peas. Here Julia Child, Simone Beck, and Louisette Bertholle break down the classic foods of France into a logical sequence of themes and variations rather than presenting an endless and diffuse catalogue of dishes. Throughout, the focus is on key recipes that form the backbone of French cookery and lend themselves to an infinite number of elaborations--bound to increase anyone's culinary repertoire. With over 100 instructive illustrations to guide readers every step of the way, <i>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</i> deserves a place of honor in every kitchen in America.",

    "description": "When Simon's older sister, Ad\u00e8le, picks him up from school, he has his hat and gloves and scarf and sweater, his coat and knapsack and books and crayons, and a drawing of a cat he made that morning. Ad\u00e8le makes Simon promise to try not to lose anything. But as they make their way home, distractions cause Simon to leave something behind at every stop. What will they tell their mother?<br /><br />Detailed pen-and-ink drawings - filled with soft watercolors - make a game of this unforgettable tour through the streets and scenes of early-twentieth-century Paris. Illustrated endpapers extend the fun by replicating a 1907 Baedeker map of Paris.<br /><br /><i>Ad\u00e8le &amp; Simon</i> is a 2006 New York Times Book Review Best Illustrated Book of the Year and a 2007 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.",

    "description": "COP: \u201cBuddy, I think this is a whorehouse.\u201d<br /><br />BUDDY CIANCI: \u201cNow I know why they made you a detective.\u201d<br /><br />Welcome to Providence, Rhode Island, where corruption is entertainment and Mayor Buddy Cianci presided over the longest-running lounge act in American politics. In <i>The Prince of Providence,</i> Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning journalist Mike Stanton tells a classic story of wiseguys, feds, and politicians on a carousel of crime and redemption.<br /><br />Buddy Cianci was part urban visionary, part Tony Soprano\u2014a flawed political genius in the mold of Huey Long and James Michael Curley. His lust for power cost him his marriage, his family, and close friendships. Yet he also revitalized the city of Providence, where ethnic factions jostle with old-moneyed New Englanders and black-clad artists from the Rhode Island School of Design rub shoulders with scam artists from City Hall. <br /><br />For nearly a quarter of a century, Cianci dominated this uneasy melting pot. During his first administration, twenty-two political insiders were convicted of corruption. In 1984, Cianci resigned after pleading guilty to felony assault, for torturing a man he suspected of sleeping with his estranged wife. In 1990, in a remarkable comeback, Cianci was elected mayor once again; he went on to win national acclaim for transforming a dying industrial city into a trendy arts and tourism mecca.<br /><br />But in 2001, a federal corruption probe dubbed Operation Plunder Dome threatened to bring the curtain down on Cianci once and for all. <br /><br />Mike Stanton takes readers on a remarkable journey through the underside of city life, into the bizarre world of the mayor and his supporting cast, including:<br /><br />\u2022 \u201cBuckles\u201d Melise, the city official in charge of vermin control, who bought Providence twice as much rat poison as the city of Cleveland, which was at the time four times as large, and wound up <i>increasing </i>Providence\u2019s rat population. During a garbage strike, Buckles sledgehammered one city employee and stuck his thumb in another\u2019s eye. Cianci would later describe this as \u201cgreat public policy.\u201d<br /><br />\u2022 Anthony \u201cthe Saint\u201d St. Laurent, a major Rhode Island bookmaker and loan shark, who tried to avoid prison by citing his medical need for forty bowel irrigations a day, thus earning himself the nickname \u201cPublic Enema Number One.\u201d<br /><br />\u2022 Dennis Aiken, a celebrated FBI agent and public corruption expert, who asked to be sent to \u201cthe Louisiana of the North,\u201d where he enlisted an undercover businessman to expose the corrupt secrets of Cianci\u2019s City Hall.<br /><br /><i>The Prince of Providence</i> is a colorful and engrossing account of one of the most tragicomic figures in modern American life\u2014and the city he transformed.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

He tries to renew feelings for his girlfriend, Blair, and for his best friend from high school, Julian, who is careering into hustling and heroin. Clay's holiday turns into a dizzying spiral of desperation that takes him through the relentless parties in glitzy mansions, seedy bars, and underground rock clubs and also into the seamy world of L.A. after dark.",

Of particular importance is the examination of Bayesianism and the new experimentalism, as well as new chapters on the nature of scientific laws and recent trends in the realism versus anti-realism debate.<br /><br /><blockquote><br />\"Crisp, lucid and studded with telling examples\u2026 As a handy guide to recent alarums and excursions (in the philosophy of science) I find this book vigorous, gallant and useful.\"<br /><br /><em>New Scientist</em><br /></blockquote>",

    "description": "From the author of the smash hits <i>Something Borrowed</i> and <i>Something Blue</i> comes a novel that explores the question: is there ever a deal-breaker when it comes to true love?<br /><br />First comes love. Then comes marriage. Then comes . . . a baby carriage? Isn't that what all women want?<br /><br />Not so for Claudia Parr. And just as she gives up on finding a man who feels the same way, she meets warm, wonderful Ben. Things seem too good to be true when they fall in love and agree to buck tradition with a satisfying, child-free marriage. Then the unexpected occurs: one of them has a change of heart. One of them wants children after all.<br /><br />This is the witty, heartfelt story about what happens to the perfect couple when they suddenly want different things. It's about feeling that your life is set and then realizing that nothing is as you thought it was\u2014and that there is no possible compromise. It's about deciding what is most important in life, and taking chances to get it. But most of all, it's about the things we will do\u2014and won't do\u2014for love.",

    "description": "Yoga is everywhere these days: Hollywood stars take their personal instructors with them on location; newspapers and magazines hail yoga as the answer to the unrelenting stress in our society; and gyms everywhere are now offering a dizzying array of classes. The yoga we practice today in the West bears little resemblance to the yoga that began humbly almost 5,000 years ago, but in its rich and varied history, yoga has always evolved to meet the needs of the culture it serves. But what distinguishes this publication are the 400 poses, or asanas, illustrated by artful black-and-white photographs taken especially for this book, that demonstrate the physical postures derived from an ancient Indian tradition. With dozens of stunning foldouts, this book beautifully explores a wide range of yoga with an emphasis on how it touches more than the physical body; the flexibility and stamina achieved on the yoga mat will doubtless transcend to more important aspects of everyday life. Linda Sparrowe\u2019s introduction traces the evolution of yoga, rooted in the devotional and metaphysical teachings of the sacred yoga texts including the Vedas, Upanishads, and the Bhagavad-Gita, and progressing to an in-depth look at the philosophy of Patanjali, the father of modern yoga. Included are brief introductions to the twentieth-century yogis who were influential in making yoga a Western, and indeed a worldwide, obsession.",

By turns beguiling and gripping, finally worldwrecking, <i>Only Revolutions</i> is unlike anything ever published before, a remarkable feat of heart and intellect, moving us with the journey of two kids, perpetually of summer, perpetually sixteen, who give up everything except each other.",

At the heart of this compelling history are the stories of John Zephaniah Holwell, survivor of the Black Hole of Calcutta, and John Stewart and John Oswald, who traveled to India in the eighteenth century, converted to the animal-friendly tenets of Hinduism, and returned to Europe to spread the word. Leading figures of the Enlightenmentamong them Rousseau, Voltaire, and Benjamin Franklingave intellectual backing to the vegetarians, sowing the seeds for everything from Victorian soup kitchens to contemporary animal rights and environmentalism.<br /><br /><br />Spanning across three centuries with reverberations to our current world, <em>The Bloodless Revolution</em> is a stunning debut from a young historian with enormous talent and promise.",

But that all changes one summer when an unexpected tragedy takes place behind its closed doors...and the Toussaint's family history -- and future -- is dramatically transformed. Angela has not returned to the Good House since her son, Corey, died there two years ago.

    "description": "Koushun Takami's notorious high-octane thriller is based on an irresistible premise: a class of junior high school students is taken to a deserted island where, as part of a ruthless authoritarian program, they are provided arms and forced to kill one another until only one survivor is left standing. Criticized as violent exploitation when first published in Japan - where it then proceeded to become a runaway bestseller - Battle Royale is a Lord of the Flies for the 21st century, a potent allegory of what it means to be young and (barely) alive in a dog-eat-dog world. Made into a controversial hit movie of the same name, Battle Royale is already a contemporary Japanese pulp classic, now available for the first time in the English language.",

Spanning forty years, this is the story of turbulent Tom Wingo, his gifted and troubled twin sister Savannah, and their struggle to triumph over the dark and tragic legacy of the extraordinary family into which they were born.<br /><br />Filled with the vanishing beauty of the South Carolina low country as well as the dusty glitter of New York City, <b>The Prince of Tides</b> is PAT CONROY at his very best.",

This sparkling anthology covers the entire span of Twain\u2019s inimitable yarn-spinning, from his early broad comedy to the biting satire of his later years.<br /><p>Every one of his sixty stories is here: ranging from the frontier humor of \u201cThe Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,\u201d to the bitter vision of humankind in \u201cThe Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg,\u201d to the delightful hilarity of \u201cIs He Living or Is He Dead?\u201d Surging with Twain\u2019s ebullient wit and penetrating insight into the follies of human nature, this volume is a vibrant summation of the career of\u2013in the words of H. L. Mencken\u2013\u201cthe father of our national literature.\u201d</p>",

    "description": "From one of America\u2019s most critically acclaimed graphic novel writers \u2013 inspired by true events, a startlingly original look at life on the streets of Baghdad during the Iraq War. <p>In his award-winning work on Y THE LAST MAN and EX MACHINA (one of Entertainment Weekly\u2019s 2005 Ten Best Fiction titles), writer Brian K. Vaughan has displayed an understanding of both the cost of survival and the political nuances of the modern world. Now, in this provocative graphic novel, Vaughan examines life on the streets of war-torn Iraq. </p><p>In the spring of 2003, a pride of lions escaped from the Baghdad zoo during an American bombing raid. Lost and confused, hungry but finally free, the four lions roamed the decimated streets of Baghdad in a desperate struggle for their lives. In documenting the plight of the lions, PRIDE OF BAGHDAD raises questions about the true meaning of liberation \u2013 can it be given or is it earned only through self-determination and sacrifice? And in the end, is it truly better to die free than to live life in captivity? </p><p>Based on a true story, VAUGHAN and artist NIKO HENRICHON (Barnum!) have created a unique and heartbreaking window into the nature of life during wartime, illuminating this struggle as only the graphic novel can.</p>",

    "description": "Margaret Atwood is acknowledged as one of the foremost writers of our time. In Moral Disorder she has created a series of interconnected stories that trace the course of a life and also the lives intertwined with it--those of parents, of siblings, of children, of friends, of enemies, of teachers, and even of animals. As in a photograph album, time is measured in sharp, clearly observed moments. The '30s, the '40s, the '50s, the '60s, the '70s, the '80s, the '90s, and the present --all are here. The settings vary: large cities, suburbs, farms, northern forests. <br /><br />The first story, \"The Bad News,\" is set in the present, as a couple no longer young situate themselves in a larger world no longer safe. The narrative then switches time as the central character moves through childhood and adolescence in \"The Art of Cooking and Serving,\" \"The Headless Horseman,\" and \"My Last Duchess.\" We follow her into young adulthood in \"The Other Place\" and then through a complex relationship, traced in four of the stories: \"Monopoly,\" \"Moral Disorder,\" \"White Horse,\" and \"The Entities.\" The last two stories, \"The Labrador Fiasco\" and \"The Boys at the Lab,\" deal with the heartbreaking old age of parents but circle back again to childhood, to complete the cycle. <br /><br />By turns funny, lyrical, incisive, tragic, earthy, shocking, and deeply personal, Moral Disorder displays Atwood's celebrated storytelling gifts and unmistakable style to their best advantage. As the New York Times has said: \"The reader has the sense that Atwood has complete access to her people's emotional histories, complete understanding of their hearts and imaginations.\"",

    "description": "<b>A young ex-con in a small Illinois town.</b> A lonely giant with a haunted past. A beautiful girl with a troubled heart. Strange and darkly magical, <i>How the Hula Girl Sings</i> begins exactly where most pulp fiction usually ends, with the vivid episode of the terrible crime itself. Three years later, Luce Lemay, out on parole for the awful tragedy, does his best to finds hope: in a new job at the local Gas-N-Go; in his companion and fellow ex-con, Junior Breen, who spells out puzzling messages to the unquiet ghosts of his past; and finally, in the arms of the lovely but reckless Charlene. <i>How the Hula Girl Sings</i> is a suspenseful exploration of a country bright with the far-off stars of forgiveness and dark with the still-looming shadow of the death penalty.<br /><br />Paperback reissue of the second novel from the author of the indie-hit Hairstyles of the Damned",

    "description": "From the king of \"Gonzo\" journalism and bestselling author who brought you <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i> comes another astonishing volume of letters by Hunter S. Thompson.<br /><br />Brazen, incisive, and outrageous as ever, this second volume of Thompson's private correspondence is the highly anticipated follow-up to <i>The Proud Highway</i>. When that first book of letters appeared in 1997, Time pronounced it \"deliriously entertaining\"; Rolling Stone called it \"brilliant beyond description\"; and <i>The New York Times</i> celebrated its \"wicked humor and bracing political conviction.\"<br /><br />Spanning the years between 1968 and 1976, these never-before-published letters show Thompson building his legend: running for sheriff in Aspen, Colorado; creating the seminal road book <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i>; twisting political reporting to new heights for <i>Rolling Stone</i>; and making sense of it all in the landmark <i>Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72</i>. To read Thompson's dispatches from these years--addressed to the author's friends, enemies, editors, and creditors, and such notables as Jimmy Carter, Tom Wolfe, and Kurt Vonnegut--is to read a raw, revolutionary eyewitness account of one of the most exciting and pivotal eras in American history.",

    "description": "<b>Milk Glass Moon</b>, the third book in Adriana Trigiani's bestselling Big Stone Gap series, continues the life story of Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney as she faces the challenges and changes of motherhood with her trademark humor and honesty. With twists as plentiful as those found on the holler roads of southwest Virginia, this story takes turns that will surprise and enthrall the reader.<br /><br />Transporting us from Ave Maria's home in the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Italian Alps, from New York City to the Tuscan countryside, <b>Milk Glass Moon</b><i> </i>is the story of a shifting mother-daughter relationship, of a daughter's first love and a mother's heartbreak, of an enduring marriage that contains its own ongoing challenges, and of a community faced with seismic change.<br /><br />All of Trigiani's beloved characters are back: Jack Mac, Ave Maria's true love, who is willing to gamble security for the unknown; her best friend and confidant, bandleader Theodore Tip-ton, who begins a new life in New York City; librarian and sexpert Iva Lou Wade Makin, who faces a life-or-death crisis. Meanwhile, surprises emerge in the blossoming of crusty cashier Fleeta Mullins, the maturing of mountain girl turned savvy businesswoman Pearl Grimes, and the return of Pete Rutledge, the handsome stranger who turned Ave Maria's world upside down in<b> Big Cherry Holler</b>. <br /><br />In this rollicking hayride of upheaval and change, Ave Maria is led to places she never dreamed she would go, and to people who enter her life and rock its foundation. As Ave Maria reaches into the past to find answers to the present, readers will stay with her every step of the way, rooting for the onetime town spinster who embraced love and made a family. <b>Milk Glass Moon</b><i> </i>is about the power of love and its abiding truth, and captures Trigiani at her most lyrical and heartfelt.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

In letters to a Who's Who of luminaries from Norman Mailer to Charles Kuralt, Tom Wolfe to Lyndon Johnson, William Styron to Joan Baez\u2014not to mention his mother, the NRA, and a chain of newspaper editors\u2014Thompson vividly catches the tenor of the times in 1960s America and channels it all through his own razor-sharp perspective. Passionate in their admiration, merciless in their scorn, and never anything less than fascinating, the dispatches of <i>The Proud Highway</i> offer an unprecedented and penetrating gaze into the evolution of the most outrageous raconteur/provocateur ever to assault a typewriter.",

From the seemingly trivial postponement of a visit to a nearby lighthouse, Woolf constructs a remarkable, moving examination of the complex tensions and allegiances of family life and the conflict between men and women.<br /><br />As time winds its way through their lives, the Ramsays face, alone and simultaneously, the greatest of human challenges and its greatest triumph\u2014the human capacity for change.",

    "description": "Maurice is heartbroken over unrequited love, which opened his heart and mind to his own sexual identity. In order to be true to himself, he goes against the grain of society\u2019s often unspoken rules of class, wealth, and politics. <br /> Forster understood that his homage to same-sex love, if published when he completed it in 1914, would probably end his career. Thus, <i>Maurice</i> languished in a drawer for fifty-seven years, the author requesting it be published only after his death (along with his stories about homosexuality later collected in <i>The Life to Come</i>). <br /> Since its release in 1971, <i>Maurice</i> has been widely read and praised. It has been, and continues to be, adapted for major stage productions, including the 1987 Oscar-nominated film adaptation starring Hugh Grant and James Wilby.",

    "description": "An international bestseller and the basis for a hugely successful film, Ken Kesey's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" was one of the defining works of the 1960s. Marking the fortieth anniversary of Viking's publication of this American classic, this deluxe hardcover edition includes a new introduction by Robert Faggen and drawings Kesey made when he worked at the psychiatric hospital that was the inspiration for the novel. <br /> A mordant, wickedly subversive parable set in a mental ward, the novel chronicles the head-on collision between its hell-raising, life-affirming hero Randle Patrick McMurphy and the totalitarian rule of Big Nurse. McMurphy swaggers into the mental ward like a blast of fresh air and turns the place upside down, starting a gambling operation, smuggling in wine and women, and egging on the other patients to join him in open rebellion. But McMurphy's revolution against Big Nurse and everything she stands for quickly turns from sport to a fierce power struggle with shattering results. <br /> With \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" Kesey created a work without precedent in American literature, a novel at once comic and tragic that probes the nature of madness and sanity, authority and vitality. Greeted by unanimous acclaim when it was first published, the book has become an enduring favorite of readers. This new edition-modeled on the popular fortieth-anniversary edition of Jack Kerouac's \"On the Road\"-will bring Kesey's genius to a new generation while delighting his loyal fans.",

    "description": "Witty, wise, and hope-filled, <em>Five Fortunes</em> is a large-hearted tale of five vivid and unforgettable women who know where they've been but have no idea where they're going. A lively octogenarian, a private investigator, a mother and daughter with an unresolved past, and a recently widowed politician's wife share little else except a thirst for new dreams, but after a week at the luxurious health spa known as \"Fat Chance\" their lives will be intertwined in ways they couldn't have imagined. At a place where doctors, lawyers, spoiled housewives, movie stars, and captains of industry are stripped of the social markers that keep them from really seeing one another, unexpected friendships emerge, reminding us of the close links between the rich and the poor, fortune and misfortune, and the magic of chance.",

    "description": "The Year of Four Emperors, so the ancient sources assure us, was one of the most chaotic, violent, and frightening periods in all Roman history. It was a time of assassinations and civil war, of armies so out of control that they had no qualms about occupying the city of Rome, and of ambitious men who ruthlessly seized power only to have it wrenched from their grasps.<br /> In 69 AD, Gwyn Morgan offers a fresh look at this period, based on two considerations to which insufficient attention has been paid in the past. First, that we need to unravel rather than cherry-pick between the conflicting accounts of Tacitus, Plutarch and Suetonius, our three main sources of information. And second, that the role of the armies, as distinct from that of their commanders, has too often been exaggerated. The result is a remarkably accurate and insightful narrative history, filled with colorful portraits of the leading participants and new insights into the nature of the Roman military.<br /> A strikingly vivid account of ancient Rome, 69 AD is an original and compelling account of one of the best known but perhaps least understood periods in all Roman history. It will engage and enlighten all readers with a love for the tumultuous soap opera that was Roman political life.<br />",

    "description": "Stalingrad est sans doute le tournant capital de la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Sa chute aurait livr\u00e9 \u00e0 Hitler les p\u00e9troles du Caucase. Et quel symbole que de prendre la ville qui portait le nom du \" petit p\u00e8re des peuples \"... De ces enjeux r\u00e9sulta un des plus gigantesques - et des plus atroces - affrontements militaires de l'Histoire. La Wehrmacht en ressortit bris\u00e9e l'Arm\u00e9e rouge y forgea la l\u00e9gende d'un communisme lib\u00e9rateur. Pour conter cette \u00e9pop\u00e9e, o\u00f9 l'h\u00e9ro\u00efsme et la barbarie se c\u00f4toient \u00e0 chaque page, l'historien britannique Antony Beevor a pu acc\u00e9der, le premier, aux archives sovi\u00e9tiques, jalousement tenues secr\u00e8tes jusqu'\u00e0 la chute du r\u00e9gime, qu'il a confront\u00e9es aux archives allemandes ainsi qu'\u00e0 d'innombrables t\u00e9moignages. Op\u00e9rations militaires, relations entre les hauts grad\u00e9s et le pouvoir politique, souffrances quotidiennes des combattants des deux bords et des civils : \u00e0 tous les niveaux, ce r\u00e9cit rigoureux et inspir\u00e9 apporte des r\u00e9v\u00e9lations et des \u00e9clairages nouveaux. Il nous fait revivre au jour le jour une bataille o\u00f9 se joua le sort du monde. On sort de ce bilan magistral abasourdi par l'ampleur et l'horreur des destructions humaines... mais aussi par le temps qu'il a fallu \u00e0 l'Histoire pour qu'elle reprenne, sur un tel sujet, ses droits. Voil\u00e0 qui est fait. Pierre Daix, Le Figaro litt\u00e9raire",

    "description": "The publication of this slender volume was inspired by the runaway success of <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i>, in which Auden's \"Funeral Blues\" practically stole the show. Yet every poem in the collection delivers some grandiose or mundane truth about love. There is, for example, the playful \"Calypso,\" in which the recently transplanted Briton anticipates a rendezvous at New York's Grand Central Station: \"For there in the middle of that waiting-hall, / Should be standing the one that I love best of all.\" Several of the pieces here share that jolly air and belting rhythm--in fact, Auden wrote a few of them as cabaret songs. Yet in a poem like \"Funeral Blues,\" the poet's Cole Porter-like flippancy can't mask the underlying sense of grief. \"Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,\" he suggests, and declares the very emblems of romance redundant: \"The stars are not wanted now; put out every one.\" Finally, there is \"Lullaby,\" one of the great love poems of this century. With immense mystery and power, Auden evokes the preciousness of a single night of passion. <blockquote> Time and fevers burn away<br /> Individual beauty from<br /> Thoughtful children, and the grave<br /> Proves the child ephemeral:<br /> But in my arms till break of day<br /> Let the living creature lie,<br /> Mortal, guilty, but to me<br /> The entirely beautiful.<br /></blockquote> Leaving much unexplained, the poet lingers nonetheless over his heartbreaking particulars--and draws the reader back again and again: \"Lay your sleeping head, my love, / Human on my faithless arm...\" What an astonishing opener. <i>--Cherry Smyth</i>",

The latest, third, edition, appeared in 1957 and is now in its tenth reprinting. After each new element of grammar the learner is given a set of exercises, and the book also contains useful resources such as a list of hieroglyphic signs and information about the development of the language.",

Across the chessboard of Europe, from the German plains to the flourishing Dutch cities and down to Venice, the gateway to the East, our hero, a 'Survivor', a radical Protestant Anabaptist who goes under many names, and his enemy, a loyal papal spy and heretic hunter known mysteriously as \"Q\" play a game in which no moves are forbidden and the true size of the stakes remain hidden until the end. What begins as a personal struggle to reveal each other's identity becomes a mission that can only end in death. <br /></div>",

    "description": "Lydia Kilkenny is eager to move beyond her South Boston childhood, and when she marries Henry Wickett, a shy Boston Brahmin who plans to become a doctor, her future seems assured. That path changes when Henry abandons his medical studies and enlists Lydia to help him invent a mail-order medicine called Wickett's Remedy. Then the 1918 influenza epidemic sweeps through Boston, and in a world turned upside down Lydia must forge her own path through the tragedy unfolding around her. As she secures work as a nurse at a curious island medical station conducting human research into the disease, Henry's former business partner steals the formula for Wickett's Remedy to create for himself a new future, trying--and almost succeeding--to erase the past he is leaving behind.<br /><br />Alive with narrative ingenuity, and tinged with humor as well as sorrow, this inspired recreation of a forgotten era powerfully reminds us how much individual voices matter--in history and in life.<br />(back cover)",

    "description": "<p> <i>Manchild in the Promised Land</i> is indeed one of the most remarkable autobiographies of our time. This thinly fictionalized account of Claude Brown's childhood as a hardened, streetwise criminal trying to survive the toughest streets of Harlem has been heralded as the definitive account of everyday life for the first generation of African Americans raised in the Northern ghettos of the 1940s and 1950s. When the book was first published in 1965, it was praised for its realistic portrayal of Harlem -- the children, young people, hardworking parents; the hustlers, drug dealers, prostitutes, and numbers runners; the police; the violence, sex, and humor. The book continues to resonate generations later, not only because of its fierce and dignified anger, not only because the struggles of urban youth are as deeply felt today as they were in Brown's time, but also because the book is affirmative and inspiring. Here is the story about the one who \"made it,\" the boy who kept landing on his feet and became a man.</p>",

He gained entry to\u00a0DeBeers, the London diamond merchants. He visited shopping mall\u00a0jewellers with\u00a0starry-eyed couples.\u00a0Through all of his travels, he searched for\u00a0an answer to the question \"How has one stone created empires, ruined lives, inspired lust and emptied wallets throughout history?\" A diamond version of Susan Orleans's <i>The Orchid Thief,</i> Tom Zoellner's <i>The Heartless Stone</i> is a journey\u00a0 to the cold heart of the world's\u00a0most unyielding gem.",

    "description": "Following the best-selling \"Paris to the Moon, \" the continuation of the Gopniks' adventures against the panorama of a different though no less storied city as they attempt to make a new home for themselves. <br />Autumn 2000: After five years in Paris, Adam Gopnik moves his family back to a New York that seems, at first, safer and shinier than ever. Here in the wondrously strange \"neighborhood\" of Manhattan we observe the triumphs and travails of father, mother, son, and daughter; and of the teachers, coaches, therapists, adversaries, and friends who round out the extended urban family. From Bluie, a goldfish fated to meet a Hitchcockian end, to Charlie Ravioli, an imaginary playmate who, being a New Yorker, is too busy to play, the Gopniks' new home is under the spell of the sort of characters only the city's unique civilization of childhood could produce. <br />Not long after their return, the fabric of living will be rent by the events of 9/11, but like a magic garment will reweave itself, reviving normalcy in a world where Jewish jokes mingle with debates about the problem of consciousness, the price of real estate, and the meaning of modern art. Along the way, the impermanence and transcendence of life will be embodied in the person of a beloved teacher and coach who, even facing death, radiates a distinctively local light. <br />Written with Gopnik's signature mix of mind and heart, elegant and exultantly alert to the minute miracles that bring a place to life, \"Through the Children's Gate\" is a chronicle, by turns tender and hilarious, of a family taking root in the unlikeliest patch of earth.",

    "description": "Hello. I am Daniel Handler, the author of this book. Did you know that authors often write the summaries that appear on their book's dust jacket? You might want to think about that the next time you read something like, \"A dazzling page-turner, this novel shows an internationally acclaimed storyteller at the height of his astonishing powers.\"<br /><br />\"Adverbs\" is a novel about love -- a bunch of different people, in and out of different kinds of love. At the start of the novel, Andrea is in love with David -- or maybe it's Joe -- who instead falls in love with Peter in a taxi. At the end of the novel, it's Joe who's in the taxi, falling in love with Andrea, although it might not be Andrea, or in any case it might not be the same Andrea, as Andrea is a very common name. So is Allison, who is married to Adrian in the middle of the novel, although in the middle of the ocean she considers a fling with Keith and also with Steve, whom she meets in an automobile, unless it's not the same Allison who meets the Snow Queen in a casino, or the same Steve who meets Eddie in the middle of the forest. . . .<br /><br />It might sound confusing, but that's love, and as the author -- me -- says, \"It is not the nouns. The miracle is the adverbs, the way things are done.\" This novel is about people trying to find love in the ways it is done before the volcano erupts and the miracle ends. Yes, there's a volcano in the novel. In my opinion a volcano automatically makes a story more interesting.",

Her husband, Richard, works for a humanitarian organization dedicated to the health and prosperity of developing countries and wants her help on an extended AIDS assignment in the Dominican Republic. But Alma begs off joining him: the publisher is breathing down her neck. She promises to work hard and follow him a bit later. <br /><br /> The truth is that Alma is seriously sidetracked by a story she has stumbled across. It's the story of a much earlier medical do-gooder, Spaniard Francisco Xavier Balmis, who in 1803 undertook to vaccinate the populations of Spain's American colonies against smallpox. To do this, he required live \"carriers\" of the vaccine. <br /><br /> Of greater interest to Alma is Isabel Sendales y G\u00f3mez, director of La Casa de Exp\u00f3sitos, who was asked to select twenty-two orphan boys to be the vaccine carriers. She agreed\u2014 with the stipulation that she would accompany the boys on the proposed two-year voyage. Her strength and courage inspire Alma, who finds herself becoming obsessed with the details of Isabel's adventures.<br /><br /> This resplendent novel-within-a-novel spins the disparate tales of two remarkable women, both of whom are swept along by machismo. In depicting their confrontation of the great scourges of their respective eras, Alvarez exposes the conflict between altruism and ambition.",

    "description": "At the core of <i>A Pattern Language</i> is the philosophy that in designing their environments people always rely on certain \u2018languages,\u2019 which, like the languages we speak, allow them to articulate and communicate an infinite variety of designs within a formal system which gives them coherence.<br /><br />This book provides a language of this kind. It will enable making a design for almost any kind of building, or any part of the built environment. \u2018Patterns,\u2019 the units of this language, are answers to design problems: how high should a window sill be?; how many stories should a building have?; how much space in a neighborhood should be devoted to grass and trees?<br /><br />More than 250 of the patterns in this language are outlined, each consisting of a problem statement, a discussion of the problem with an illustration, and a solution. As the authors say in their introduction, many of the patterns are archetypal, so deeply rooted in the nature of things that it seems likely that they will be a part of human nature and human action as much in five hundred years as they are today.<br /><br /><i>A Pattern Language</i> is related to Alexander\u2019s other works in the Center for Environmental Structure series: <i>The Timeless Way of Building</i> (introductory volume) and <i>The Oregon Experiment</i>.<br />",

They don't really succeed, and when they return home they find their town empty. <br /><br />They call other towns. <br /><br />They find the whole world empty.<br /><br />But eventually they discover three other Kids their Age who are still alive in the town. They cannot imagine why the five of them seem to be the only ones left of the entire human race. They have only one thing in common. They were each directly or indirectly involved in the death of Betty Sue - the plain, shy girl who committed suicide only a short time ago. Betty Sue - the quiet, brilliant girl who wrote short stories about each of them. Stories of hate, of revenge, of death in a dead world.<br /><br />It makes them wonder who Betty Sue really was.<br /><br />Or <i>what</i> Betty Sue was.",

As psychiatrists, their quest takes them from the squalor of the Victorian lunatic asylum to the crowded lecture halls of the renowned Professor Charcot in Paris; from the heights of the Sierra Madre in California to the plains of unexplored Africa.<br /><br />As the concerns of the old century fade and the First World War divides Europe, the two men's volatile relationship develops and changes, but is always tempered by one exceptional woman; Thomas's sister Sonia.<br /><br />Moving and challenging in equal measure, <i>Human Traces</i> explores the question of what kind of beings men and women really are.",

    "description": "Some of the most inspired (and acclaimed) Italian food in the country is served at Babbo Ristorante e Enoteca, Mario Batali's flagship restaurant in the heart of New York City's Greenwich Village. Diners in this converted town house have come to expect innovative flavors and artful presentations that make the most of seasonal, local, and artisanal ingredients--all with a sensibility that is distinctly Italian. Now home cooks can re-create these showstopping dishes, just as they are served at the restaurant, to win raves of their own. <br /><b>The Babbo Cookbook</b> is Mario's biggest yet, filled with 150 recipes that have redefined contemporary Italian cooking. Here for the first time he shares such signature dishes as Mint Love Letters with Spicy Lamb Sausage and Beef Cheek Ravioli, all showcasing his unparalleled ability to reinterpret the Italian culinary tradition in a completely original way. Recipes for dozens of Babbo's renowned antipasti, many based on fresh seasonal produce, are followed by an alluring collection of pastas; fish, fowl, and meat entrees; and a selection of Babbo's irresistible dessert offerings. From Grilled Pork Chops with Peaches and Balsamic Vinegar to Spicy Lamb Tartare with Mint Crostini and a Quail Egg and Wild Striped Bass with Charred Leeks and Squid Vinaigrette, <b>The Babbo Cookbook</b> is filled with vibrant, complex flavors that belie their straightforward preparations. Even classic recipes like Bollito Misto and Pappardelle Bolognese come alive again in bright new renditions that delight the palate. <br />Also included are notes on the unique touches that make a meal at Babbo such a singular dining experience, from suggestions on wine service to recipes for -predesserts- that smooth the transition from savory to sweet--all representing the distinctive brand of Italian hospitality that has become the Batali trademark. <br /><b>The Babbo Cookbook</b> is that rarity in the world of restaurant cookbooks: a collection of accessible, appetizing recipes that brings the spirit of a remarkable restaurant into the home kitchen without losing an iota of tantalizing flavor in the translation.",

When she is chosen as a lower-ranking concubine she enters the erotically charged and ritualised Forbidden City. But beneath its immaculate fa\u00e7ade lie whispers of murders and ghosts, and the thousands of concubines will stoop to any lengths to bear the Emperor's son.<br /><br />Orchid trains herself in the art of pleasuring a man, bribes her way into the royal bed, and seduces the monarch, drawing the attention of dangerous foes. Little does she know that China will collapse around her, and that she will be its last Empress.",

    "description": "In the fall of 1948, Ernest Hemingway made his first extended visit to Italy in thirty years. His reacquaintance with Venice, a city he loved, provided the inspiration for <i>Across the River and into the Trees,</i> the story of Richard Cantwell, a war-ravaged American colonel stationed in Italy at the close of the Second World War, and his love for a young Italian countess. A poignant, bittersweet homage to love that overpowers reason, to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the worldweary beauty and majesty of Venice, <i>Across the River and into the Trees</i> stands as Hemingway's statement of defiance in response to the great dehumanizing atrocities of the Second World War. Hemingway's last full-length novel published in his lifetime, it moved John O'Hara in <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> to call him \"the most important author since Shakespeare.\"",

They are amongst the world\u2019s most revered and ancient teachings and are the earliest, most holy yoga reference.<br /><br /><br />The Sutras are short and to the point \u2013 each being only a line or two long. BKS Iyengar has translated each one, and provided his own insightful commentary and explanation for modern readers.<br /><br /><br />The Sutras show the reader how we can transform ourselves through the practice of yoga, gradually developing the mind, body and emotions, so we can become spiritually evolved.<br /><br /><br />The Sutras are also a wonderful introduction to the spiritual philosophy that is the foundation of yoga practise.<br /><br /><br />The book is thoroughly cross-referenced, and indexed, resulting in an accessible and helpful book that is of immense value both to students of Indian philosophy and practitioners of yoga.",

    "description": "<i>Death Comes for the Archbishop</i> sprang from Willa Cather\u2019s love for the land and cultures of the American Southwest. Published in 1927 to both praise and perplexity, it has since claimed for itself a major place in twentieth-century literature.\u00a0When Cather first visited the American Southwest in 1912, she found a new world to imagine and soon came to feel that \"the story of the Catholic Church in [the Southwest] was the most interesting of all its stories.\" The narrative follows Bishop Jean Latour and Father Joseph Vaillant, friends since their childhood in France, as they organize the new Roman Catholic diocese of Santa Fe subsequent to the Mexican War. While seeking to revive the church and build a cathedral in the desert, the clerics, like their historical prototypes, Bishop Jean Lamy and Father Joseph Machebeuf, face religious corruption, natural adversity, and the loneliness of living in a strange and unforgiving land.\u00a0The Willa Cather Scholarly Edition presents groundbreaking research, establishing a new text that reflects Cather\u2019s long and deep involvement with her story. The historical essay traces the artistic and spiritual development that led to its writing. The broad-ranging explanatory notes illuminate the elements of French, Mexican, Hispanic, and Native American cultures that meet in the course of the narrative; they also explain the part played by the land and its people\u2014their history, religion, art, and languages. The textual essay and apparatus reveal Cather\u2019s creative process and enable the reader to follow the complex history of the text.",

A curse that began with his no-good-dirty-rotten- pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather and has since followed generations of Yelnats. Now Stanley has been unjustly sent to a boys' detention center, Camp Green Lake, where the warden makes the boys \"build character\" by spending all day, every day, digging holes: five feet wide and five feet deep. It doesn't take long for Stanley to realize there's more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake. The boys are digging holes because the warden is looking for something. Stanley tries to dig up the truth in this inventive and darkly humorous tale of crime and punishment\u2014and redemption.",

    "description": "Who else but Whole Foods Market could create a cookbook so fresh, so appealing, so full of valuable information, and so perfect for the way we are all cooking and eating today? Bursting with winning recipes, healthful cooking advice, cheerful guidance through the new language of natural foods, wine and cheese information, and a comprehensive glossary, this is a \u201cthank goodness it\u2019s here\u201d kind of cookbook.<br /><br />The world\u2019s largest natural and organic supermarket has created 350 contemporary recipes that are destined to become new classics. Whole Foods Market presents the most popular dishes from their prepared foods section, combined with brand-new recipes that showcase the wide variety of delicious ingredients available today. Far from \u201ccrunchy granola\u201d fare, sophisticated recipes include Shrimp and Scallop Chalupas, Hazelnut Crusted Pork Loin, Thai-Style Green Curry Chicken, Griddled Sesame and Garlic Tofu with Wilted Bok Choy, Honey Jalape\u00f1o Barbecue Sauce, and Maple Butterscotch Macadamia Blondies. From meat and fish to tofu and vegetables, kid-friendly dishes to one-pot meals, the choices are dazzling, and with more than 200 of the recipes either vegetarian or vegan, the options are diverse.<br /><br />But the recipes are just the beginning. Steve Petusevsky and Whole Foods Market Team Members shed light on the confusing world of natural foods, presenting interesting, accessible information and all kinds of helpful cooking advice. <b>The Whole Foods Market Cookbook</b> is as welcoming and fun as a trip to one of their stores. Find out the answers to questions such as:<br /><br />How do I cook quinoa?<br />What are the different kinds of tofu, and how do I know which to buy?<br />How should I stock a great natural foods pantry?<br />What are good alternatives to wheat pasta?<br />What does \u201corganic\u201d mean?<br /><br />A glossary with more than 150 definitions provides a great reference for all of the terms and ingredients that have been edging their way into our vocabularies and kitchens. With recipe bonuses, tips from the team, variations, sidebars, and 30 menu suggestions, this is the natural foods guide that so many of us have been waiting for.",

    "description": "An ancient title of respect for women, the word cunt long ago veered off this noble path. Inga Muscio traces the road from honor to expletive, giving women the motivation and tools to claim cunt as a positive and powerful force in their lives. In this fully revised edition, she explores, with candidness and humor, such traditional feminist issues as birth control, sexuality, jealousy between women, and prostitution with a fresh attitude for a new generation of women. Sending out a call for every woman to be the Cunt lovin Ruler of Her Sexual Universe, Muscio stands convention on its head by embracing all things cunt-related. This edition is fully revised with updated resources, a new foreword from sexual pioneer Betty Dodson, and a new afterword by the author.",

At Ballou, Cedric has almost no friends. He eats lunch in a classroom most days, plowing through the extra work he has asked for, knowing that he\u2019s really competing with kids from other, harder schools. Cedric Jennings\u2019s driving ambition\u2013which is fully supported by his forceful mother\u2013is to attend a top-flight college.<br /><br />In September 1995, after years of near superhuman dedication, he realizes that ambition when he begins as a freshman at Brown University. In this updated edition, A Hope in the Unseen chronicles Cedric\u2019s odyssey during his last two years of high school, follows him through his difficult first year at Brown, and now tells the story of his subsequent successes in college and the world of work.",

    "description": "Goethe\u2019s masterpiece and perhaps the greatest work in German literature, Faust has made the legendary German alchemist one of the central myths of the Western world. Here indeed is a monumental Faust, an audacious man boldly wagering with the devil, Mephistopheles, that no magic, sensuality, experience, or knowledge can lead him to a moment he would wish to last forever. Here, in Faust, Part I, the tremendous versatility of Goethe\u2019s genius creates some of the most beautiful passages in literature. Here too we experience Goethe\u2019s characteristic humor, the excitement and eroticism of the witches\u2019 Walpurgis Night, and the moving emotion of Gretchen\u2019s tragic fate.<br /><br />This authoritative edition, which offers Peter Salm\u2019s wonderfully readable translation as well as the original German on facing pages, brings us Faust in a vital, rhythmic American idiom that carefully preserves the grandeur, integrity, and poetic immediacy of Goethe\u2019s words.",

          "description": "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust is a tragic play in two parts: [book:Faust : Der Trag\u00f6die Erster Teil|1095059] (translated as: [book:Faust Part One|14706]) and [book:Faust : Der Trag\u00f6die Zweiter Teil|1095060] ([book:Faust: Part Two|14707]). Although rarely staged in its entirety, it is the play with the largest audience numbers on German-language stages. Faust is Goethe's most famous work and considered by many to be one of the greatest works of German literature.\n    \n    Goethe completed a preliminary version of [book:Faust Part One|14706] in 1806. The 1808 publication was followed by the revised 1828\u201329 edition, which was the last to be edited by Goethe himself. Prior to these appeared a partial printing in 1790 of [book:Goethe's Faust: Ein Fragment|17107703] (Faust: a Fragment).\n    \n    The earliest forms of the work, known as the [book:Urfaust|1384628], were developed between 1772 and 1775; however, the details of that development are no longer entirely clear. Urfaust has twenty-two scenes, one in prose, two largely prose and the remaining 1,441 lines in rhymed verse. The manuscript is lost, but a copy was discovered in 1886.\n    \n    Goethe finished writing [book:Faust: Part Two|14707] in 1831. In contrast to Part One, the focus here is no longer on the soul of Faust, which has been sold to the devil, but rather on social phenomena such as psychology, history and politics, in addition to mystical and philosophical topics. The second part formed the principal occupation of Goethe's last years. It appeared only posthumously in 1832.\n    \n    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goethe%27s_Faust",

    "description": "<i>The Aeneid</i> is an epic poem written by Virgil in the 1st century BC. It's hero is Aeneas, a Trojan who travels from Troy to Italy to eventually found Rome. Some argue that <i>The Aeneid</i> is Virgil's answer to Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> and <i>Iliad</i>, combining two genres of the day - travel and war - into one poem. Take that, Homer!<br /><br />No civilization is without a bit of revisionist history: so it was that Virgil picked up the story of Aeneas, which was already floating around at the time, and forged an epic founding myth for Rome. And <i>The Aeneid</i> fit the bill, as it linked Rome with the legends of ancient Troy, glorified stodgy Roman values, and legitimized its emperors as descendants of the heroes and gods of the past. George Washington probably didn't chop down a cherry tree, but it's a fun legend to tell the kids.",

    "description": "<strong>Beth Lisick</strong> started out as a homecoming princess with a Crisco-aided tan and a bad perm. And then everything changed. How exactly did this suburban girl next door end up as one of San Francisco's foremost chroniclers of alternative culture, touring as the only straight woman with a band of punk rock lesbian poets and living in illegal warehouses -- all while managing to get married, buy a house, and have a baby? Lisick explains it all in her hilarious, irreverent memoir <strong>Everybody into the Pool</strong>.<br /><br />Plunging headlong into America's deepest subcultures, while keeping both feet firmly planted in her parents' <em>Leave It to Beaver</em> values, Lisick makes her adult home on the fringe of mainstream culture and finds it rich with paradox and humor. On one hand, she lives in \"Brokeley\" with drug dealers and street gangs; on the other, she drives a station wagon with a car seat in the back, makes her own chicken stock, and attends ladies' luncheons.<br /><br />Among Lisick's true tales are \"My Way or the Bi-Way,\" in which a series of girl-on-girl fiascos from UC Santa Cruz confirm her suspicions that she's just a straight girl with a positive attitude who'd give anything the old college try; \"The Lowly Hustle,\" in which she takes on a litany of odd jobs to make ends meet (\"I was like a college student designing my own major, except I was thirty-five and designing my own minimum-wage job\"); and the endearing story of her \"courtship\" with her now husband Eli, who impresses her with a spastic rendition of a song called \"The Wack-Ass Caucasian Two Step Chicken\" and invites her to his Mission District warehouse space -- a world of feral raccoons and exploding sewage pipes. (It's clear to Lisick that he's \"The One.\")<br /><br />Fans of David Sedaris and Sarah Vowell will relish Lisick's scathingly funny, smart, and very real take on the effluvia of daily living. No matter what community she's exposing to the light, Lisick's hilarious perspective always hits the right chord.",

The first, a science fiction of the past, tells of a boy whose brother was \u2018devoured\u2019 by the machine he operated. The second is a noirish thriller set in our century, as a police psychologist attempts to track down a group of terrorists. And the third and final strand accompanies two strange beings into the future.<br /><br />A novel of connecting and reconnecting, inspired by the writings of the great visionary poet Walt Whitman, <i>Specimen Days</i> is a genre-bending, haunting ode to life itself \u2013 a work of surpassing power and beauty by one of the most original and daring writers at work today",

    "description": "In the wake of <i>Sassy</i> and as an alternative to the more staid reporting of <i>Ms. Magazine,</i> <i>Bitch</i> was launched in the mid-nineties as a Xerox-and-staple zine covering the landscape of popular culture from a feminist perspective. Both unabashed in its love for the guilty pleasures of consumer culture and deeply thoughtful about the way the pop landscape reflects and impacts women's lives, <i>Bitch </i>grew to be a popular, full-scale magazine with a readership that stretched worldwide. Today it stands as a touchstone of hip, young feminist thought, looking with both wit and irreverence at the way pop culture informs feminism--and vice versa--and encouraging readers to think critically about the messages lurking behind our favorite television shows, movies, music, books, blogs, and the like. <i>BITCHFest </i>offers an assortment of the most provocative essays, reporting, rants, and raves from the magazine's first ten years, along with new pieces written especially for the collection. Smart, nuanced, cranky, outrageous, and clear-eyed, the anthology covers everything from a 1996 celebration of pre-scandal Martha Stewart to a more recent critical look at the \"gayby boom\"; from a time line of black women on sitcoms to an analysis of fat suits as the new blackface; from an attempt to fashion a feminist vulgarity to a reclamation of female virginity. It's a recent history of feminist pop-culture critique and an arrow toward feminism's future.<br />",

    "description": "Comedian Lewis Black unleashes his trademark subversive wit while recounting his own life story in his <i>New York Times</i> bestselling memoir.<br /><br />You've seen him on <i>The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</i> offering up his trademark angry observational humor on everything from politics to pop culture. You've seen his energetic stand-up performances on HBO, Comedy Central, and in venues across the globe. Now, for the first time, Lewis Black translates his volcanic eruptions into book form in <i>Nothing's Sacred,</i> a collection of rants against stupidity and authority, which oftentimes go hand in hand.<br /><br /> With subversive wit and intellectual honesty, Lewis examines the events of his life that shaped his antiauthoritarian point of view and developed his comedic perspective. Growing up in 1950s suburbia when father knew best and there was a sitcom to prove it, he began to regard authority with a jaundiced eye at an early age. And as that sentiment grew stronger with each passing year, so did his ability to hone in on the absurd.<br /><br /> True to form, he puts common sense above ideology and distills hilarious, biting commentary on all things politically and culturally relevant. \"No one is safe from Lewis Black's comic missiles.\" (<i>New York Times</i>)<br /><br /><b>You have been warned....</b>",

Devastated, Sidda begs forgiveness, and postpones her upcoming wedding. All looks bleak until the Ya-Yas step in and convince Vivi to send Sidda a scrapbook of their girlhood mementos, called \"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.\" As Sidda struggles to analyze her mother, she comes face to face with the tangled beauty of imperfect love, and the fact that forgiveness, more than understanding, is often what the heart longs for.",

    "description": "People in poverty face challenges virtually unknown to those in middle class or wealth--challenges from both obvious and hidden sources. The reality of being poor brings out a survival mentality, and turns attention away from opportunities taken for granted by everyone else. If you work with people from poverty, some understanding of how different their world is from yours will be invaluable. Whether you're an educator--or a social, health, or legal services professional--this breakthrough book gives you practical, real-world support and guidance to improve your effectiveness in working with people from all socioeconomic backgrounds. Since 1995 A Framework for Understanding Poverty has guided hundreds of thousands of educators and other professionals through the pitfalls and barriers faced by all classes, especially the poor. Carefully researched and packed with charts, tables, and questionnaires, Framework not only documents the facts of poverty, it provides practical yet compassionate strategies for addressing its impact on people's lives.",

    "description": "Do you want to make a true difference in the world? Dr. Ron Sider does. He has, since before he first published <i>Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger</i> in 1978. <br /><br />Despite a dramatic reduction in world hunger since then, 34,000 children still die daily of starvation and preventable disease, and 1.3 billion people, worldwide, remain in abject poverty. So, the professor of theology went back to re-examine the issues by twenty-first century standards. Finding that Conservatives blame morally reprehensible individual choices, and Liberals blame constrictive social and economic policy, Dr. Sider finds himself agreeing with both sides. <br /><br />In this new look at an age-old problem, he offers not only a detailed explanation of the causes, but also a comprehensive series of practical solutions, in the hopes that Christians like him will choose to make a difference.",

    "description": "Why do some people prefer heterosexual love while others fancy the same sex? Is sexual identity biologically determined or a product of convention? In this brilliant and provocative book, the acclaimed author of <i>Myths of Gender</i> argues that even the most fundamental knowledge about sex is shaped by the culture in which scientific knowledge is produced.Drawing on astonishing real-life cases and a probing analysis of centuries of scientific research, Fausto-Sterling demonstrates how scientists have historically politicized the body. In lively and impassioned prose, she breaks down three key dualisms - sex/gender, nature/nurture, and real/constructed - and asserts that individuals born as mixtures of male and female exist as one of five natural human variants and, as such, should not be forced to compromise their differences to fit a flawed societal definition of normality.",

    "description": "\"One True Thing\" is a breathtaking, brilliantly realized novel, and it moves Anna Quindlen to the forefront of fiction writers in America. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for commentary, Quindlen is widely admired for her extraordinary intelligence, humor, and insight, and for the depth of her perceptions about the public and private lives of ordinary people. All these distinctive and original gifts, plus the magic only a superb writer of fiction can create, are evident in this astonishing book. A young woman is in jail, accused of the mercy killing of her mother. She says she didn't do it; she thinks she knows who did. When Ellen Gulden first learns that her mother, Kate, has cancer, the disease is already far advanced. Her father insists that Ellen quit her job and come home to take care of Kate. Ellen has always been the special child in the family, the high achiever, her father's intellectual match, and the person caught in the middle between her parents. She has seen herself as very different from her mother, the talented homemaker, the family's popular center, its one true thing. Yet as Ellen begins to spend her days with Kate, she learns many surprising things, not only about herself but also about her mother, a woman she thought she knew so well. The life choices Ellen and her mother have made are reassessed in this deeply moving novel, a work of fiction that is richly imbued with profound insights into the complex lives of women and men. Anna Quindlen writes masterfully, and with great sophistication and grace, about love and death, sexuality and betrayal, the triangles within a family, identity, growth, and change. She writes about the mysteries at the heart of the person wethink we are, of who and what we know. And she explores the ambiguities that make up marriage, character, family, and fate. As Kate Gulden's pain increases, so do the dosages of morphine. And so does Ellen's belief that her mother's suffering is unendurable. \"One True Thing\" is a remarkable.",

    "description": "They charmed some of Europe\u2019s most illustrious men, honing their social skills as well as their sexual ones, and accumulating wealth, fame, and power along the way. Unlike their geisha counterparts, courtesans didn't lived in brothels or bend their wills to suit their suitors. They were the muses who enflamed the hearts of our most celebrated artists--Raphael, Manet, Dumas, and Proust, to name just a few--as well as becoming artists in their own right. Offering the first comprehensive tour of their worlds, Susan Griffins celebrates these first feminists and hails their virtues: Timing, Beauty, Cheek, Brilliance, Gaiety, Grace, and Charm. <br /><br />From <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/73247.Veronica_Franco\" title=\"Veronica Franco\" rel=\"nofollow\">Veronica Franco</a>, who graced the palazzos of sixteenth-century Venice, and Madame de Pompadour, the arbiter of all things fashionable at Versailles during the reign of Lous XV, to La Belle Otero of the grand boulevards of Paris in the Gay Nineties and Marion Davies, who took Hollywood by storm in the 1920's and 1930's, <i>The Book of the Courtesans</i> enticingly illustrates the intricacies of their lavish lifestyles and incredible life stories. Fascinating true tales and enlightening snippets from courtesans' memoirs further reveal how these cunning women seized their opportunity to become the West's first liberators, free to choose their own lovers and command remarkable respect.<br /><br />Delving into his scintillating world, <i>The Book of the Courtesans</i> is an impeccably researched, beautifully crafted portrait of some of the most intriguing figures in women's history.",

    "description": "<b>Erik Weihenmayer</b> was born with retinoscheses, a degenerative eye disorder that would leave him blind by the age of thirteen. But Erik was determined to rise above this devastating disability and lead a fulfilling and exciting life. <br /><br />In this poignant and inspiring memoir, he shares his struggle to push past the limits imposed on him by his visual impairment-and by a seeing world. He speaks movingly of the role his family played in his battle to break through the barriers of blindness: the mother who prayed for the miracle that would restore her son's sight and the father who encouraged him to strive for that distant mountaintop. And he tells the story of his dream to climb the world's Seven Summits, and how he is turning that dream into astonishing reality (something fewer than a hundred mountaineers have done). <br /><br />From the snow-capped summit of McKinley to the towering peaks of Aconcagua and Kilimanjaro to the ultimate challenge, Mount Everest, this is a story about daring to dream in the face of impossible odds. It is about finding the courage to reach for that ultimate summit, and transforming your life into something truly miraculous.<br /><br />\"I admire you immensely. You are an inspiration to other blind people and plenty of folks who can see just fine.\" (Jon Krakauer, author of <b>Into Thin Air</b>)",

With <i>The Big Oyster</i>, Mark Kurlansky serves up history at its most engrossing, entertaining, and delicious.<br />",

    "description": "The author of <i>Other People's Children</i> joins with other experts to examine the relationship between language and power in the classroom. <p><i>The Skin That We Speak</i> takes the discussion of language in the classroom beyond the highly charged war of idioms and presents today's teachers with a thoughtful exploration of the varieties of English that we speak, in what <i>Black Issues Book Review</i> calls \"an essential text.\" </p><p>Edited by bestselling author Lisa Delpit and education professor Joanne Kilgour Dowdy, the book includes an extended new piece by Delpit herself, as well as groundbreaking work by Herbert Kohl, Gloria Ladson-Billings, and Victoria Purcell-Gates, as well as classic texts by Geneva Smitherman and Asa Hilliard. </p><p>At a time when children are written off in our schools because they do not speak formal English, and when the class- and race-biased language used to describe those children determines their fate, <i>The Skin That We Speak</i> offers a cutting-edge look at crucial educational issues.</p>",

    "description": "In the village of King's Abbot, a widow's sudden suicide sparks rumors that she murdered her first husband, was being blackmailed, and was carrying on a secret affair with the wealthy Roger Ackroyd. The following evening, Ackroyd is murdered in his locked study--but not before receiving a letter identifying the widow's blackmailer. King's Abbot is crawling with suspects, including a nervous butler, Ackroyd's wayward stepson, and his sister-in-law, Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd, who has taken up residence in the victim's home. It's now up to the famous detective Hercule Poirot, who has retired to King's Abbot to garden, to solve the case of who killed Roger Ackroyd--a task in which he is aided by the village doctor and narrator, James Sheppard, and by Sheppard's ingenious sister, Caroline.<br /><br /><i>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</i> is the book that made Agatha Christie a household name and launched her career as a perennial bestseller. Originally published in 1926, it is a landmark in the mystery genre. It was in the vanguard of a new class of popular detective fiction that ushered in the modern era of mystery novels.",

    "description": "Includes:<br /><br />- The Mating Season<br />- The Code of the Woosters<br />- Right Ho, Jeeves<br /><br />From the introduction by Hugh Laurie: \"The first thing you should know and probably the last too is that PG Wodehouse is still the funniest writer ever to put words on paper. This much is uncontested by all but the most irretrievably insane. Fact number two: with the Jeeves stories, Wodehouse created the best of the best. The world of Jeeves is complete and integral; every bit as structured, layered, ordered, complex and self-contained as King Lear and considerably funnier.\"<br /><br />Bertie is embroiled in plot and counterplot in these three glorious Jeeves and Wooster novels. In <i>The Mating Season</i>, Bertie pretends he is his old pal Gussie Fink-Nottle to ensure Gussie's engagement to the soppy Madeline Bassett comes to no harm. <i>The Code of the Woosters</i> finds Bertie in an even worse mess. His fearsome Aunt Dahlia has blackmailed him into purloining a particularly hideous cow-creamer from the home of Sir Watkyn Bassett. Unfortunately, other parties have their own plans for the unsavoury item, and for Bertie too. In <i>Right Ho, Jeeves</i>, Bertie takes matters in hand when Jeeves suggests Bertie's friend Gussie Fink-Nottle puts on scarlet tights and a false beard to achieve the object of his desire. As usual, only Jeeves can sort out the ensuing chaos. 'The funniest writer ever to put words on paper.' Hugh Laurie",

    "description": "Although Oscar Wilde (1854\u20131900) created a wide range of poetry, essays, and fairy tales (and one novel) in his brief, tragic life, he is perhaps best known as a dramatist. His witty, clever drama, populated by brilliant talkers skilled in the art of riposte and paradox, are still staples of the theatrical repertoire.<br /><i>An Ideal Husband</i> revolves around a blackmail scheme that forces a married couple to reexamine their moral standards \u2014 providing, along the way, a wry commentary on the rarity of politicians who can claim to be ethically pure. A supporting cast of young lovers, society matrons, an overbearing father, and a formidable femme fatale continually exchange sparkling repartee, keeping the play moving at a lively pace.<br />Like most of Wilde's plays, this scintillating drawing-room comedy is wise, well-constructed, and deeply satisfying. An instant success at its 1895 debut, the play continues to delight audiences over one hundred years later. <i>An Ideal Husband</i> is a must-read for Wilde fans, students of English literature, and anyone delighted by wit, urbanity, and timeless sophistication.",
