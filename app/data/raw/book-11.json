    "description": "Meet Forrest Gump, the lovable, herculean, and surprisingly savvy hero of this remarkable comic odyssey. After accidentally becoming the star of University of Alabama's football team, Forrest goes on to become a Vietnam War hero, a world-class Ping-Pong player, a villainous wrestler, and a business tycoon -- as he wonders with childlike wisdom at the insanity all around him. In between misadventures, he manages to compare battle scars with Lyndon Johnson, discover the truth about Richard Nixon, and survive the ups and downs of remaining true to his only love, Jenny, on an extraordinary journey through three decades of the American cultural landscape. Forrest Gump has one heck of a story to tell -- and you've got to read it to believe it....",

Miss Snaith brought him to light after you had gone. Please scrutinize his thumb. I never saw a felon, but I have diagnosed it as such. Yours truly, S. McBRIDE, <br /><br />Sup't John Grier Home, March 6. Dear Judy: I don't know yet whether the children are going to love me or not, but they do love my dog. No creature so popular as Singapore ever entered these gates. Every afternoon three boys who have been perfect in deportment are allowed to brush and comb him, while three other good boys may serve him with food and drink. But every Saturday morning the climax of the week is reached, when three superlatively good boys give him a nice lathery bath with hot water and flea soap. The privilege of serving as Singapore's valet is going to be the only incentive I shall need for maintaining discipline. <br /><br />But isn't it pathetically unnatural for these youngsters to be living in the country and never owning a pet? Especially when they, of all children, do so need something to love. I am going to manage pets for them somehow, if I have to spend our new endowment for a menagerie. Couldn't you bring back some baby alligators and a pelican. Anything alive will be gratefully received. <br /><br />This should by rights be my first \" Trustees' Day.\" I am deeply grateful to Jervis for arranging a simple business meeting in New York, as we are not yet on dress parade up here; but we are hoping by the first Wednesday in April to have something visible to show. If all of the doctor's ideas, and a few of my own, get themselves materialized, our trustees will open their eyes a bit when we show them about. I have just made out a chart for next week's meals, and...",

    "description": "Marilyn Johnson was enthralled by the remarkable lives that were marching out of this world\u2014so she sought out the best obits in the English language and the people who spent their lives writing about the dead. She surveyed the darkest corners of Internet chat rooms, and made a pilgrimage to London to savor the most caustic and literate obits of all. Now she leads us on a compelling journey into the cult and culture behind the obituary page and the unusual lives we don't quite appreciate until they're gone.",

As the story begins, one daughter has returned home secretly pregnant, and she and her sister are sneaking out at night to meet the Finch twins in the apartment downstairs, while Barry, the patriarch, has devised a challenge for his daughters: whoever can secure the future of the Barnacle line within the week will inherit his whole fortune.<br /><br />A love story, a family chronicle, and a portrait of a city, <i>A Taxonomy of Barnacles</i> is \"a confident and witty debut that brings to mind an eccentric combination of <i>The Virgin Suicides </i>and<i> Little Women</i>\" (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>).",

    "description": "A shimmering evocation, by turns intimate and panoramic, of one of the world\u2019s great cities, by its foremost writer. Orhan Pamuk was born in Istanbul and still lives in the family apartment building where his mother first held him in her arms. His portrait of his city is thus also a self-portrait, refracted by memory and the melancholy\u2013or <i>h</i>\u00fc<i>z</i>\u00fc<i>n\u2013</i> that all <i>Istanbullus</i> share: the sadness that comes of living amid the ruins of a lost empire.With cinematic fluidity, Pamuk moves from his glamorous, unhappy parents to the gorgeous, decrepit mansions overlooking the Bosphorus; from the dawning of his self-consciousness to the writers and painters\u2013both Turkish and foreign\u2013who would shape his consciousness of his city. Like Joyce\u2019s Dublin and Borges\u2019 Buenos Aires, Pamuk\u2019s <i>Istanbul </i>is a triumphant encounter of place and sensibility, beautifully written and immensely moving.",

    "description": "They were seventeen, with perfect tans and perfect bodies. They planned on a joyride in a convertible on a hot summer day. They planned on skinny-dipping in a beautiful, secluded lake. They planned on making it back to camp before anyone noticed they were gone. What they \"didn't\" plan on was being followed by two guys in a beat-up station wagon. . . . Their day soon takes a drastic turn -- all because Kristy Sweetland smiled at the wrong time, in the wrong place, at the wrong boys.<br /><br />Now the girls feel prying eyes on them all the time -- during pep practice, on the path through the woods, outside the window of their cabin. The boys are stalking them, leaving threatening notes on their beds, and watching their every move.<br /><br />\"Boy Heaven\" is a provocative, page-turning mystery, and a must-read for anyone who loves an urban legend.",

    "description": "A captivating read from a debut novelist, <i>Brick Lane</i> brings the immigrant milieu of East London to vibrant life. With great poignancy, Ali illuminates a foreign world; her well-developed characters pull readers along on a deeply psychological, almost spiritual journey. Through the eyes of two Bangladeshi sisters\u2014the plain Nazneen and the prettier Hasina\u2014we see the divergent paths of the contemporary descendants of an ancient culture. Hasina elopes to a \"love marriage,\" and young Nazneen, in an arranged marriage, is pledged to a much older man living in London. <br /><br />Ali's skillful narrative focuses on Nazneen's stifling life with her ineffectual husband, who keeps her imprisoned in a city housing project filled with immigrants in varying degrees of assimilation. But Ali reveals a bittersweet tension between the \"two kinds of love\" Nazneen and her sister experience\u2014that which begins full and overflowing, only to slowly dissipate, and another which emerges like a surprise, growing unexpectedly over years of faithful commitment. Both of these loves have their own pitfalls: Hasina's passionate romance crumbles into domestic violence, and Nazneen's marriage never quite reaches a state of wedded bliss.<br /><br />Though comparisons have drawn between Ali and Zadie Smith, a better comparison might be made between this talented newcomer and the work of Amy Tan, who so deftly portrays the immigrant experience with empathy and joy.",

    "description": "The author writes: FRANNY came out in The New Yorker in 1955, and was swiftly followed, in 1957 by ZOOEY. Both stories are early, critical entries in a narrative series I'm doing about a family of settlers in twentieth-century New York, the Glasses. It is a long-term project, patently an ambiguous one, and there is a real-enough danger, I suppose that sooner or later I'll bog down, perhaps disappear entirely, in my own methods, locutions, and mannerisms. On the whole, though, I'm very hopeful. I love working on these Glass stories, I've been waiting for them most of my life, and I think I have fairly decent, monomaniacal plans to finish them with due care and all-available skill.",

The mystery takes Rebus into the heart of a shattered community. Ex-Army himself, Rebus becomes fascinated by the killer, and finds he is not alone. Army investigators are on the scene, and won't be shaken off. The killer had friends and enemies to spare and left behind a legacy of secrets and lies.<br /><br />Rebus has more than his share of personal problems, too. He's fresh out of hospital, but won't say how it happened. Could there be a connection with a house-fire and the unfortunate death of a petty criminal who had been harassing Rebus's colleague Siobhan Clarke?",

In the game of love, there are winners and losers.<br />In 'THE LOSERS' CLUB', Richard Perez tries to answer the eternal question. <br /><br />Set in downtown New York City, 'THE LOSERS' CLUB' tells the story of Martin Sierra, an unlucky writer addicted to the personals. <br /><br />His journey brings us into the East Village, pre-9/11 - and in contact with Nikki, his dream woman, who remains unattainable romantically yet becomes his friend and confidant during his illuminating misadventures. <br /><br />Populated with characters and surprises few will ever forget, this energetic, comic novel is as much about a generation (we won't say \"X\") as it is about a specific time and place.",

Teeming with frank sexuality and heartfelt compassion, this book is an important window on to the experience of loss and love in the Arab world.",

    "description": "<b>Sins of the Father</b><p>Akhil Sharma's <i>An Obedient Father</i> is a first novel of surprising depth and complexity; rich and disturbing, its twists and revelations continually challenge the reader's preconceptions. Ram Karan, the protagonist and primary narrator, is an inspector for the corrupt Delhi school system. For all intents and purposes, he is a bribe-collector, although not a particularly good one. \"My panic in negotiations was so apparent,\" he explains, \"that even people who were eager to bribe me became resentful.\" Anxious and overweight, recently widowed, he is driven by fear rather than political convictions. The Congress Party sustains him, but when Rajiv Gandhi is assassinated, Karan finds himself caught precariously between the party and the rising Bharatiya Janata Party. If he switches parties, and the BJP loses the election, he will be attacked by Congress and tried on corruption charges. If he doesn't switch parties, he will lose his job.<br /></p><p><br />This decision is complicated by the drama of his home life. Karan shares his apartment with his daughter Anita, whose husband has just died, and their relationship is far from civil. \"My mind was adept at reducing its presence,\" he admits, \"when my body did something shameful.\" In the past, his body has often been beyond his control. When Anita was a girl, he raped her repeatedly and now 20 years later he begins to find the presence of her 12-year-old daughter Asha extremely provocative.<br /></p><p><br />Anita notices this attraction and brings her memories into the open, using them to demand money and other concessions from her father. The bribes Karan pays Anita mount as he, now working for the BJP, begins selling the very land out from under schools, and filters the money back to the party for election funding. He believes in nothing but his own preservation and even seeks to bribe both parties to protect himself.<br /></p><p><br /><i>An Obedient Father</i> chronicles these personal and political dramas and their intersections. While both storylines are engrossing, neither is particularly encouraging or uplifting. It is the subtlety of Sharma's prose that makes the novel so compelling and so readable. For example, here is Karan describing his own appearance: \"I wore a blue shirt that stretched so tight across my stomach that the spaces between the buttons were puckered open like small hungry mouths.\" In a book that concerns itself with unnatural, unhealthy appetites, even inanimate objects speak of dissolution.<br /></p><p><br />Ram Karan is a monstrous character, in both his public and private life, yet he is so carefully depicted that his motivations and emotions are perfectly understood. If he cannot be sympathetic, he is very nearly so. His narrative dominates the novel, imbuing it with his anxiety and helplessness; his guilt is palpable, as is his desire to change or at least control his behavior. Part of the reason he is unable to realize a change, or draw nearer to happiness, is the lack of forgiveness that Anita shows him. In the sections she narrates, she reveals herself as a somewhat sinister, scarred figure whose only desire is to free herself by tormenting her father. The depth of her hatred and the extent of her revenge are chilling and utterly believable.<br /></p><p><br /><i>An Obedient Father</i> may be too dark for some readers; however, its power is undeniable, and its story fascinating. At its close, the remaining characters are left with the effects of terrible causes, and the hope that the future may bring, with its knowledge of the past, less destructive actions. <br /></p><p><br />\u0097<i>Peter Rock</i><br /></p><p><br />Peter Rock is the author of the novels <i>Carnival Wolves </i>and<i> This Is the Place. </i>Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, he now lives in Philadelphia.</p><p></p>",

    "description": "Where once a young woman had to be ashamed of her sexual experience, today she is ashamed of her sexual inexperience. Where not long ago an unmarried woman was ashamed to give public evidence of sexual desire by living with someone, today she must be ashamed to give evidence of romantic desire. From sex education in grade school to coed bathrooms in college, today's young woman is being pressured relentlessly to overcome her embarrassment, her \"hang-ups,\" and especially her romantic hopes. <br /> Meanwhile, the problems young women struggle with grow steadily more extreme: from sexual harassment, stalking, and date rape to anorexia and self-mutilation. Both men and women endlessly lament the loss of privacy and of real intimacy. What is it all about? <br /> Beholden neither to conservatives who discount as exaggeration the dangers facing young women, nor to feminists who steadfastly affix blame on the patriarchy, Wendy Shalit proposes that, in fact, we have lost our respect for an important classical virtue -- that of sexual modesty. <i>A Return to Modesty</i> is a deeply personal account as well as a fascinating intellectual exploration. From seventeenth-century manners guides to Antonio Canova's sculpture, <i>Venus Italico,</i> to Frank Loesser's 1948 tune, \"Baby, It's Cold Outside,\" <i>A Return to Modesty</i> unfolds like a detective's search for a lost idea as Shalit uncovers opinions about this lost virtue's importance, from Balzac to Simone de Beauvoir, that have not been aired for decades. Then she knocks down the accompanying myths one by one. Female modesty is not about a \"sexual double standard,\" as is often thought, but is related to male virtue and honor. Modesty is not a social construct, but a natural response. And modesty is not prudery, but a way to preserve a sense of the erotic in our lives. <br /> With humor and piercing insight, Shalit invites us to look beyond the blush and consider the new power to be found in an old ideal. She maintains that the sex education curriculum forced on those of her generation from an early age is fundamentally flawed, centered as it is on overcoming reticence -- what we today call \"hang-ups.\" Shalit surprisingly and persuasively argues that without these misnamed hang-ups there can be no true surrender, no richness and depth to relations between the sexes. The natural inclination toward modesty is not a hang-up that we should set out to cure, but rather a wonderful instinct that, if rediscovered and given the right social support, has the power to transform society.",

    "description": "Melissa Romney-Jones went from doormat to diva when she donned a blond wig, became Honey, a no-nonsense bombshell, and set up shop providing London's most clueless men with all the basic girlfriend services -- except, of course, for sex and laundry! Now, her business is booming, but when her flat-mate decides to renovate, she has to temporarily find a new place to live. Then Melissa's dashing American boyfriend (and former client) Jonathan Riley gets a promotion that takes him to New York. There's only one solution: an extended holiday for Melissa in the Big Apple. <br /><br /><br /><br />Entrusting care of the Little Lady Agency to her tactless best friend and her melodramatic sister, Melissa crosses the pond and finds herself out of her depth among Jonathan's hard-charging friends and his interfering ex-wife. Although Jonathan works all the time, he asks Melissa not to take on any new clients while she's in his hometown. But when she's presented with a tempting new challenge, Melissa decides to put her expertise to use. Then her project lands her in the tabloids, which sets off a hilarious and heartbreaking chain of events that could force her to choose between the man she loves and the unique business into which she has poured her heart and soul. <br /><br /><br /><br />Irresistibly funny and full of the magic of New York, <i>Little Lady, Big Apple</i> is another triumph that will have you rooting for Melissa all the way!",

    "description": "'All the privilege I claim for my own sex...is that of loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.'. Anne Elliot's heartfelt words strike the keynote of Jane Austen's last completed novel. It features a heroine older and wiser than her predecessors in earlier books, and its tone is more intimate and sober as Jane Austen unfolds a simple love-story. She described her heroine in a letter as 'almost too good for me': Anne Elliot's goodness is not of the cloying kind, but an unsentimental quality that, combined with stoicism and integrity, enables her to find happiness in love after seven years when it seemed she had for ever put an end to such a prospect.",

    "description": "A brilliant and poetic exploration of the way that we experience time in our everyday lives.<br /><br />Why does time seem so short? How does women's time differ from men's? Why does time seem to move slowly in the countryside and quickly in cities? How do different cultures around the world see time? In <b>A Sideways Look at Time</b>, Jay Griffiths takes readers on an extraordinary tour of time as we have never seen it before.<br /><br />With this dazzling and defiant work, Griffiths introduces us to dimensions of time that are largely forgotten in our modern lives. She presents an infectious argument for other, more magical times, the diverse cycles of nature, of folktale or carnival, when time is unlimited and on our side. This is a book for those who suspect that there's more to time than clocks.<br /><br />Irresistible and provocative, <b>A Sideways Look at Time</b> could change the way we view time-forever.",

    "description": "Arch-swindler Moist Van Lipwig never believed his confidence crimes were hanging offenses - until he found himself with a noose tightly around his neck, dropping through a trapdoor, and falling into...a government job?<br /><br />By all rights, Moist should have met his maker. Instead, it's Lord Vetinari, supreme ruler of Ankh-Morpork, who promptly offers him a job as Postmaster. Since his only other option is a nonliving one, Moist accepts the position - and the hulking golem watchdog who comes along with it, just in case Moist was considering abandoning his responsibilities prematurely. <br /><br />Getting the moribund Postal Service up and running again, however, may be a near-impossible task, what with literally mountains of decades-old undelivered mail clogging every nook and cranny of the broken-down post office building; and with only a few creaky old postmen and one rather unstable, pin-obsessed youth available to deliver it. Worse still, Moist could swear the mail is talking to him. Worst of all, it means taking on the gargantuan, money-hungry Grand Trunk clacks communication monopoly and its bloodthirsty piratical head, Mr. Reacher Gilt.<br />But it says on the building Neither Rain Nor Snow Nor Glom of Nit...Inspiring words (admittedly, some of the bronze letters have been stolen), and for once in his wretched life Moist is going to fight. And if the bold and impossible are what's called for, he'll do it - in order to move the mail, continue breathing, get the girl, and specially deliver that invaluable commodity that every human being (not to mention troll, dwarf, and, yes, even golem) requires: hope.",

    "description": "Traveling from East to West over thousands of years, tea has played a variety of roles on the world scene - in medicine, politics, the arts, culture, and religion. Behind this most serene of beverages, idolized by poets and revered in spiritual practices, lie stories of treachery, violence, smuggling, drug trade, international espionage, slavery, and revolution. <br /><i>Liquid Jade</i>'s rich narrative history explores tea in all its social and cultural aspects. Entertaining yet informative and extensively researched, <i>Liquid Jade</i> tells the story of western greed and eastern bliss. China first used tea as a remedy. Taoists celebrated tea as the elixir of immortality. Buddhist Japan developed a whole body of practices around tea as a spiritual path. Then came the traumatic encounter of the refined Eastern cultures with the first Western merchants, the trade wars, the emergence of the ubiquitous English East India Company. Scottish spies crisscrossed China to steal the secrets of tea production. An army of smugglers made fortunes with tea deliveries in the dead of night. In the name of \"free trade\" the English imported opium to China in exchange for tea. The exploding tea industry in the eighteenth century reinforced the practice of slavery in the sugar plantations. And one of the reasons why tea became popular in the first place is that it helped sober up the English, who were virtually drowning in alcohol. During the nineteenth century, the massive consumption of tea in England also led to the development of the large tea plantation system in colonial India - a story of success for British Empire tea and of untold misery for generations of tea workers.<br /><br /><i>Liquid Jade</i> also depicts tea's beauty and delights, not only with myths about the beginnings of tea or the lovers' legend in the familiar blue-and-white porcelain willow pattern, but also with a rich and varied selection of works of art and historical photographs, which form a rare and comprehensive visual tea record. The book includes engaging and lesser-known topics, including the exclusion of women from seventeenth-century tea houses or the importance of water for tea, and answers such questions as: \"What does a tea taster do?\" \"How much caffeine is there in tea?\" \"What is fair trade tea?\" and \"What is the difference between black, red, yellow, green, or white tea?\" <br />\u00a0<br />Connecting past and present and spanning five thousand years, Beatrice Hohenegger's captivating and multilayered account of tea will enhance the experience of a steaming \"cuppa\" for tea lovers the world over.",

    "description": "In 1967, after a session with a psychiatrist she'd never seen before, eighteen-year-old Susanna Kaysen was put in a taxi and sent to McLean Hospital. She spent most of the next two years on the ward for teenage girls in a psychiatric hospital as renowned for its famous clientele--Sylvia Plath, Robert Lowell, James Taylor, and Ray Charles--as for its progressive methods of treating those who could afford its sanctuary. <br /><br />Kaysen's memoir encompasses horror and razor-edged perception while providing vivid portraits of her fellow patients and their keepers. It is a brilliant evocation of a \"parallel universe\" set within the kaleidoscopically shifting landscape of the late sixties. Girl, Interrupted is a clear-sighted, unflinching documnet that gives lasting and specific dimension to our definitions of sane and insane, mental illness and recovery.",

Each critical essay is accompanied by a succinct introduction to the history, principles, and practice of the critical perspective and by a bibliography that promotes further exploration of that approach. In addition, the text and essays are complemented by an introduction providing biographical and historical contexts for Hardy and Tess of the d'Urbervilles, a survey of critical responses to the work since its initial publication, and a glossary of critical and theoretical terms.",

    "description": "<b>A fast-paced narrative history of the coups, revolutions, and invasions by which the United States has toppled fourteen foreign governments -- not always to its own benefit</b><br /><br />\"Regime change\" did not begin with the administration of George W. Bush, but has been an integral part of U.S. foreign policy for more than one hundred years. Starting with the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893 and continuing through the Spanish-American War and the Cold War and into our own time, the United States has not hesitated to overthrow governments that stood in the way of its political and economic goals. The invasion of Iraq in 2003 is the latest, though perhaps not the last, example of the dangers inherent in these operations.<br /><br />In <i>Overthrow</i>, Stephen Kinzer tells the stories of the audacious politicians, spies, military commanders, and business executives who took it upon themselves to depose monarchs, presidents, and prime ministers. He also shows that the U.S. government has often pursued these operations without understanding the countries involved; as a result, many of them have had disastrous long-term consequences.<br /><br />In a compelling and provocative history that takes readers to fourteen countries, including Cuba, Iran, South Vietnam, Chile, and Iraq, Kinzer surveys modern American history from a new and often surprising perspective.<br /><br />\"Detailed, passionate and convincing . . . [with] the pace and grip of a good thriller.\" -- Anatol Lieven, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>",

    "description": "The bestselling story of Julia's years in France--and the basis for <i>Julie &amp; Julia</i>, starring Meryl Streep and Amy Adams--in her own words.<br /> Although she would later singlehandedly create a new approach to American cuisine with her cookbook <i>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</i> and her television show <i>The French Chef</i>, Julia Child was not always a master chef. Indeed, when she first arrived in France in 1948 with her husband, Paul, who was to work for the USIS, she spoke no French and knew nothing about the country itself. But as she dove into French culture, buying food at local markets and taking classes at the Cordon Bleu, her life changed forever with her newfound passion for cooking and teaching. Julia's unforgettable story--struggles with the head of the Cordon Bleu, rejections from publishers to whom she sent her now-famous cookbook, a wonderful, nearly fifty-year long marriage that took the Childs across the globe--unfolds with the spirit so key to Julia's success as a chef and a writer, brilliantly capturing one of America's most endearing personalities.",

    "description": "For more than thirty years, Kevin Phillips' insight into American politics and economics has helped to make history as well as record it. His bestselling books, including <i>The Emerging Republican Majority</i> (1969) and <i>The Politics of Rich and Poor</i> (1990), have influenced presidential campaigns and changed the way America sees itself. Widely acknowledging Phillips as one of the nation's most perceptive thinkers, reviewers have called him a latter-day Nostradamus and our \"modern Thomas Paine.\" Now, in the first major book of its kind since the 1930s, he turns his attention to the United States' history of great wealth and power, a sweeping cavalcade from the American Revolution to what he calls \"the Second Gilded Age\" at the turn of the twenty-first century.<br /><br />The Second Gilded Age has been staggering enough in its concentration of wealth to dwarf the original Gilded Age a hundred years earlier. However, the tech crash and then the horrible events of September 11, 2001, pointed out that great riches are as vulnerable as they have ever been. In <i>Wealth and Democracy</i>, Kevin Phillips charts the ongoing American saga of great wealth\u2013how it has been accumulated, its shifting sources, and its ups and downs over more than two centuries. He explores how the rich and politically powerful have frequently worked together to create or perpetuate privilege, often at the expense of the national interest and usually at the expense of the middle and lower classes.<br /><br />With intriguing chapters on history and bold analysis of present-day America, Phillips illuminates the dangerous politics that go with excessive concentration of wealth. Profiling wealthy Americans\u2013from Astor to Carnegie and Rockefeller to contemporary wealth holders\u2013Phillips provides fascinating details about the peculiarly American ways of becoming and staying a multimillionaire. He exposes the subtle corruption spawned by a money culture and financial power, evident in economic philosophy, tax favoritism, and selective bailouts in the name of free enterprise, economic stimulus, and national security.<br /><br />Finally, <i>Wealth and Democracy</i> turns to the history of Britain and other leading world economic powers to examine the symptoms that signaled their declines\u2013speculative finance, mounting international debt, record wealth, income polarization, and disgruntled politics\u2013signs that we recognize in America at the start of the twenty-first century. In a time of national crisis, Phillips worries that the growing parallels suggest the tide may already be turning for us all.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "Not so long ago, parsley was the only fresh herb available to most American cooks. Today, bunches of fresh oregano and rosemary can be found in nearly every supermarket, basil and mint grow abundantly in backyards from coast to coast, and garden centers offer pots of edible geraniums and lemon thyme. But once these herbs reach the kitchen, the inevitable question arises: Now what do I do with them? Here, at last, is the first truly comprehensive cookbook to cover all aspects of growing, handling, and cooking with fresh herbs.<br /><br />Jerry Traunfeld grew up cooking and gardening in Maryland, but it wasn't until the 1980s, after he had graduated from the California Culinary Academy and was working at Jeremiah Tower's Stars restaurant in San Francisco, that he began testing the amazing potential of herb cuisine. For the past decade, Jerry Traunfeld has been chef at The Herbfarm, an enchanted restaurant surrounded by kitchen gardens and tucked into the rainy foothills of the Cascade Mountains, east of Seattle. His brilliant nine-course herb-inspired menus have made reservations at the Herbfarm among the most coveted in the country.<br /><br />Eager to reveal his magic to home cooks, Jerry Traunfeld shares 200 of his best recipes in <i>The Herbfarm Cookbook.</i> Written with passion, humor, and a caring for detail that makes this book quite special, <i>The Herbfarm Cookbook</i> explains everything from how to recognize the herbs in your supermarket to how to infuse a jar of honey with the flavor of fresh lavender. Recipes include a full range of dishes from soups, salads, eggs, pasta and risotto, vegetables, poultry, fish, meats, breads, and desserts to sauces, ice creams, sorbets, chutneys, vinegars, and candied flowers. On the familiar side are recipes for Bay Laurel Roasted Chicken and Roasted Asparagus Salad with Fried Sage explained with the type of detail that insures the chicken will be moist and suffused with the flavor of bay and the asparagus complemented with the delicate crunch of sage. On the novel side you will find such unusual dishes as Oysters on the Half Shell with Lemon Varbana Ice and Rhubarb and Angelica Pie.<br /><br />A treasure trove of information, <i>The Herbfarm Cookbook</i> contains a glossary of 27 of the most common culinary herbs and edible flowers; a definitive guide to growing herbs in a garden, a city lot, or on a windowsill; a listing of the USDA has hardiness zones; how to harvest, clean, and store fresh herbs; a Growing Requirements Chart, including each herb's life cycle, height, pruning and growing needs, and number of plants to grow for an average kitchen; and a Cooking with Fresh Herbs Chart, with parts of the herb used, flavor characteristics, amount of chopped herb for six servings, and best herbal partners.<br /><br /><i>The Herbfarm Cookbook</i> is the most complete, inspired, and useful book about cooking with herbs ever written.<br /><br />-8 pages of finished dishes in full color<br /><br />-16 full-page botanical watercolors in full color",

    "description": "A nineteenth century French priest discovers something in his mountain village at the foot of The Pyrenees which enables him to amass and spend a fortune of millions of pounds. The tale seems to begin with buried treasure and then turns into an unprecedented historical detective story - a modern Grail quest leading back through cryptically coded parchments, secret societies, the Knights Templar, the Cathar heretics of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and a dynasty of obscure French kings deposed more than 1,300 years ago. The author's conclusions are persuasive: at the core is not material riches but a secret - a secret of explosive and controversial proportions, which radiates out from the little Pyrenees village all the way to contemporary politics and the entire edifice of the Christian faith. It involves nothing less than... the Holy Grail.",

    "description": "At various times in a span of fifteen years, John McPhee made geological field surveys in the company of Eldridge Moores, a tectonicist at the University of California at Davis. The result of these trips is Assembling California, a cross-section in human and geologic time, from Donner Pass in the Sierra Nevada through the golden foothills of the Mother Lode and across the Great Central Valley to the wine country of the Coast Ranges, the rock of San Francisco, and the San Andreas family of faults. The two disparate time scales occasionally intersect--in the gold disruptions of the nineteenth century no less than in the earthquakes of the twentieth--and always with relevance to a newly understood geologic history in which half a dozen large and separate pieces of country are seen to have drifted in from far and near to coalesce as California.<br /><br />McPhee and Moores also journeyed to remote mountains of Arizona and to Cyprus and northern Greece, where rock of the deep-ocean floor has been transported into continental settings, as it has in California. Global in scope and a delight to read, <i>Assembling California</i> is a sweeping narrative of maps in motion, of evolving and dissolving lands.",

In the child\u2019s imagination, the world is transmuted into an unearthly realm: she sees everything intensely, hears the distress calls of inanimate objects, and waits for her mother to join her. But life loses none of its strangeness when the family is reunited. As the girl grows, her matter-of-fact innocence eddies increasingly around opaque and ghostly traumas: the cataclysm that engulfed her homeland, the memory of a brother who drowned and, most inescapable, her father\u2019s hopeless rage.",

And as the boys grow into young men, they discover in the other a lost spiritual brother, and a link to an unexplored world that neither had ever considered before. In effect, they exchange places, and find the peace that neither will ever retreat from again. . . .",

    "description": "L'expression <i>roman fleuve</i> devrait, sans connotation p\u00e9jorative, d\u00e9signer une \u0153uvre qui prend le temps de charrier mille petites particules d'impression pour les infuser dans l'esprit d'un lecteur captiv\u00e9. En somme, elle devrait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e pour d\u00e9signer <i>La Recherche</i> proustienne, qui s'ouvre <i>Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de chez Swann</i> et s'ach\u00e8ve une fois <i>Le Temps retrouv\u00e9</i>. <p>Dans le premier tome de ce superbe travail sur la m\u00e9moire et la m\u00e9taphore, \u0153uvre \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re mais aussi amorce dramatique d'un joyau de la langue fran\u00e7aise, le narrateur s'aper\u00e7oit fortuitement, \u00e0 l'occasion d'un go\u00fbter compos\u00e9 d'une tasse de th\u00e9 et d'une madeleine d\u00e9sormais c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, que les sens ont la facult\u00e9 de faire ressurgir le souvenir. Gr\u00e2ce aux senteurs d'un buisson d'aub\u00e9pines, il prend confus\u00e9ment conscience de la distinction entre le souvenir et la r\u00e9miniscence, pour ensuite s'exercer \u00e0 manier les mots comme de petits papiers japonais qui, touch\u00e9s par la gr\u00e2ce de l'eau, se d\u00e9ploient en corolle pour faire place \u00e0 tout un univers. Tout comme se d\u00e9ploie un roman fleuve \u00e0 partir de cette toute petite phrase l\u00e9gendaire\u00a0: \"Longtemps, je me suis couch\u00e9 de bonne heure\". <i>--Sana Tang-L\u00e9opold Wauters</i></p>",

          "description": "With <b>\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu</b> / <b>In Search of Lost Time</b> Proust attempted the perfect rendering of life in art, of the past recreated through memory. It is both a portrait of the artist and a discovery of the aesthetic by which the portrait is painted, and it was to have an immense influence on the literature of the twentieth century.\n    \n    The novel contains seven volumes:\n    <b>1 - Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de chez Swann</b> (1913): Swann's Way / The Way by Swann's\n    (Part I: Combray / Overture. Part II: Un Amour de Swann / Swann in Love. Part III : Noms de pays: le nom / Names of places: the name)\n    <b>2 - \u00c0 l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs</b> (1919): In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower / Within a Budding Grove\n    <b>3 - Le C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Guermantes</b> (1920-1921): The Guermantes Way \n    <b>4 - Sodome et Gomorrhe</b> (1921-1922): Sodom and Gomorrah / Cities of the Plain\n    <b>5 - La Prisonni\u00e8re</b> (1923): The Prisoner / The Captive\n    <b>6 - Albertine disparue / La Fugitive</b> (1925): Albertine Gone / The Fugitive / The Sweet Cheat Gone\n    <b>7 - Le Temps retrouv\u00e9</b> (1927): Time Regained / The Past Recaptured / Finding Time Again\n    \n    The novel is being adapted as a <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/65593-remembrance-of-things-past-graphic-novel-adaptation\">graphic novel</a> by [author:St\u00e9phane Heuet|119580].\n    \n    <b>In Search of Lost Time</b> is Marcel Proust\u2019s masterpiece, known for its length and the notion of involuntary memory, the most famous example being the \"episode of the madeleine\". The complete story contains nearly 1.5 million words and is one of the longest novels in world literature.\n    \n    <b>\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu</b> is translated as:\n    English: In Search of Lost Time / Remembrance of Things Past*\n    Spanish: En busca del tiempo perdido\n    German: Auf der Suche nach der verlorenen Zeit\n    Portugese: Em Busca do Tempo Perdido\n    Italian: Alla ricerca del tempo perduto\n    Dutch: Op zoek naar de verloren tijd\n    Swedish: P\u00e5 spaning efter den tid som flytt\n    Polish: W poszukiwaniu straconego czasu\n    Turkish: Kay\u0131p Zaman\u0131n \u0130zinde\n    Bulgarian: \u041f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0433\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\n    *In English the novel is widely referred to as <b>Remembrance of Things Past</b> but the title <b>In Search of Lost Time</b>, a literal rendering of the French, has gained in usage since D.J. Enright's adopted it in his 1992 revision of the earlier translation by C.K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin.",

When his delicate mission is suddenly overshadowed by seven bizarre deaths, Brother William turns detective. His tools are the logic of Aristotle, the theology of Aquinas, the empirical insights of Roger Bacon\u2014all sharpened to a glistening edge by wry humor and a ferocious curiosity. He collects evidence, deciphers secret symbols and coded manuscripts, and digs into the eerie labyrinth of the abbey, where \u201cthe most interesting things happen at night.\u201d",

    "description": "No other writer has so scandalized proper society as the Marquis de Sade, but despite the deliberate destruction of over three-quarters of his work, Sade remains a major figure in the history of ideas. His influence on some of the greatest minds of the last century\u2014from Baudelaire and Swinburne to Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky and Kafka\u2014is indisputable. This volume contains Philosophy in the Bedroom, a major novel that presents the clearest summation of his political philosophy; Eug\u00e9nie de Franval, a novella widely considered to be a masterpiece of eighteenth-century French literature; and the only authentic and complete American edition of his most famous work, Justine. This literary portrait of Sade is completed by one of his earliest philosophical efforts, Dialogue between a Priest and a Dying Man, a selection of his letters, a fifty-page chronology of his life, two important essays on Sade, and a bibliography of his work.",

Now, with the memories of his in-laws' magnificent fifty-year love affair as his guide, Wilson struggles to find his way back into the heart of the woman he adores.<br /><br /><i>Did You Know?<br /><br />The Wedding is a follow-up to The Notebook?<br /><br />The Wedding was inspired by a few unnamed couples that Nicholas knows well?<br /><br />The novel is set in the North Carolina town in which Nicholas now lives?</i>",

    "description": "Shimmering with suspense and emotional intensity - takes readers on a hunt for the truth about a man and his memories, and about both the heartbreaking fragility and enormous strength of love.<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks is our very best chronicler of the human heart. His stunning first novel, The Notebook, has been given by friend to friend and lover to lover all over the world as a testament to the timeless power of love. But if we thought he could never again move us so deeply, he now shows us he can-in a story that renews our faith in destiny...in the ability of true lovers to find each other no matter where, no matter when... Message In A Bottle <br /><br />Thrown to the waves, and to fate, the bottle could have ended up anywhere. Instead, it is found just three weeks after it begins its journey. Theresa Osborne, divorced and the mother of a twelve-year-old son, picks it up during a seaside vacation from her job as a Boston newspaper columnist. Inside is a letter that opens with: <br /><br />My Dearest Catherine, I miss you my darling, as I always do, but today is particularly hard because the ocean has been singing to me, and the song is that of our life together... <br /><br />For \"Garrett,\" the man who signs the letter, the message is the only way he knows to express his undying love for a woman he has lost. For Theresa, wary of romance since her husband shattered her trust, the message raises questions that intrigue her. Who are Garrett and Catherine? Where is he now? What is his story? <br /><br />Challenged by the mystery, and pulled to find Garrett by emotions she does not fully understand, Theresa begins a search that takes her to a sunlit coastal town and an unexpected confrontation. Brought together by chance-or something more powerful-Theresa and Garrett are people whose lives are about to touch for a purpose, in a tale that resonates with our deepest hopes for finding that special someone and everlasting love. <br /><br />Shimmering with suspense and emotional intensity, Message in a Bottle takes readers on a hunt for the truth about a man and his memories, and about both the heartbreaking fragility and enormous strength of love. For those who cherished The Notebook and readers waiting to discover the magic of Nicholas Sparks's storytelling, here is his new, achingly lovely novel of happenstance, desire, and the choices that matter most...",

For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate. <br /><br />Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone. <br /><br />During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love. <br /><br />In The Rescue Nicholas Sparks weaves his inimitable spell, immersing us in the passions and the surprising complexities of modern relationships-and in doing so, teaching us something about our own.",

    "description": "In Josie and Jack, Kelly Braffet gives us a deliciously dark, suspenseful debut novel in the tradition of Patricia Highsmith.<br /><br />Beautiful, brilliant, and inseparable, Josie and Jack Raeburn live a secluded, anarchic existence in their decaying western Pennsylvania home. The only adult in their lives is their rage-prone father, a physicist, whose erratic behavior finally drives them away. Without a moral compass to guide them, Jack leads Josie into a menacing world of wealth, eroticism, and betrayal. His sociopathic tendencies emerge, and soon Josie must decide which is stronger: the love and devotion she feels for her brother or her will to survive.<br /><br />From its opening page to its shocking climax, this contemporary Hansel and Gretel story is compulsively readable and hugely entertaining.",

    "description": "<em>Modest_Witness@Second_Millenium.FemaleMan_Meets_OncoMouse</em> explores the roles of stories, figures, dreams, theories, facts, delusions, advertising, institutions, economic arrangements, publishing practices, scientific advances, and politics in twentieth-century technoscience.<br /><br />The book's title is an e-mail address. With it, Haraway locates herself and her readers in a sprawling net of associations more far-flung than the Internet. The address is not a cozy home. There is no innocent place to stand in the world where the book's author figure, FemaleMan, encounters DuPont's controversial laboratory rodent, OncoMouse.",

    "description": "From the peep palaces of Times Square to the cubicles of corporate America, Sam Lipsyte's stories wander a dark, comic road full of need and regret. His damaged, searching narrators deliver their reports of addiction, lust, loneliness, grief, and the doomed dream of rock 'n' roll with a sly lyricism and eerie spareness that somehow redeem them. Listen to this chorus of gallows humor and goodwill sometimes gone bad and hear wild voices rise out of the din of city living: Gary is a failed punk icon turned petty drug dealer and amateur self- actualization guru; the Chersky girl makes a strange midnight discovery roller-skating through a Depression-era morgue. Pot-dazed Trotskyists, summer-camp sadists, and babysitters with an eye toward erotic humiliation also make themselves known in the lost, shattered landscapes of Lipsyte's fictions. \"When you have an old soul like I do,\" deadpans one hero, \"everything gets old really quick. Nothing is new. An avocado, a glass of beer, everything tastes like it's been sitting out on a table too long.\" These stories, loosely linked in character and setting, recall the stark realism of Denis Johnson and the wild humor of Barry Hannah. In these poignant, sharp-witted tales, Sam Lipsyte proves himself one of today's most visceral and fearless short-story writers.",

    "description": "Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical play Long Day's Journey into Night is regarded as his finest work. First published by Yale University Press in 1956, it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957 and has since sold more than one million copies. This edition includes a new foreword by Harold Bloom.<br /><br />The action covers a fateful, heart-rending day from around 8:30 am to midnight, in August 1912 at the seaside Connecticut home of the Tyrones - the semi-autobiographical representations of O'Neill himself, his older brother, and their parents at their home, Monte Cristo Cottage.<br /><br />One theme of the play is addiction and the resulting dysfunction of the family. All three males are alcoholics and Mary is addicted to morphine. They all constantly conceal, blame, resent, regret, accuse and deny in an escalating cycle of conflict with occasional desperate and half-sincere attempts at affection, encouragement and consolation.",

Deever was sent to prison while Keller escaped punishment and went on to make lots of money. In a work of tremendous power, a love affair between Keller's son, Chris, and Ann Deever, Herbert's daughter, the bitterness of George Keller, who returns from the war to find his father in prison and his father's partner free, and the reaction of a son to his father's guilt escalate toward a climax of electrifying intensity.<br /><br />Winner of the Drama Critics' Award for Best New Play in 1947, <i>All My Sons</i> established Arthur Miller as a leading voice in the American theater. <i>All My Sons</i> introduced, themes that thread through Miller's work as a whole: the relationship between fathers and sons, and the conflict between business and personal ethics.",

Sons of a desert dwelling alcoholic and a suburban wanderer clash over a film script. Austin, the achiever, is working on a script he has sold to producer Sal Kimmer when Lee, a demented petty thief, drops in. He pitches his own idea for a movie to Kimmer, who then wants Austin to junk his bleak, modern love story and write Lee's trashy Western tale.",

    "description": "In his latest international bestseller, the celebrated author of <i>The Alchemist</i> addresses the fundamental questions asked by millions: What am I doing here today? and Why do I go on living?<p>Twenty-four-year-old Veronika seems to have everything she could wish for: youth and beauty, pleny of attractive boyfriends, a fulfilling job, and a loving family. Yet something is lacking in her life. Inside her is a void so deep that nothing could possibly ever fill it. So, on the morning of November 11, 1997, Veronika decides to die. She takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting never to wake up.</p><p>Naturally Veronika is stunned when she does wake up at Villete, a local mental hospital, where the staff informs her that she has, in fact, partially succeeded in achieving her goal. While the overdose didn't kill Veronika immediately, the medication has damaged her heart so severely that she has only days to live.</p><p>The story follows Veronika through the intense week of self-discovery that ensues. To her surprise, Veronika finds herself drawn to the confinement of Villete and its patients, who, each in his or her individual way, reflect the heart of human experience. In the heightened state of life's final moments, Veronika discovers things she has never really allowed herself to feel before: hatred, fear, curiosity, love, and sexual awakening. She finds that every second of her existence is a choice between living and dying, and at the eleventh hour emerges more open to life than ever before.</p><p><i>In Veronika Decides to Die,</i> Paulo Coelho takes the reader on a distinctly modern quest to find meaning in a culture overshadowed by angst, soulless routine, and pervasive conformity. Based on events in Coelho's own life, <i>Veronika Decides to Die</i> questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal. Poignant and illuminating, it is a dazzling portrait of a young woman at the crossroads of despair and liberation, and a poetic, exuberant appreciation of each day as a renewed opportunity.</p>",

    "description": "A Magical Tale About Forgiving Our Past and Believing in Our Future<br /><br />The enchanting, true story of The Valkyries begins in Rio de Janeiro when author Paulo Coelho gives his mysterious master J., the only manuscript for his book The Alchemist. Haunted by a devastating curse, Coelho confesses to J., \"I\u2032ve seen my dreams fall apart just when I seemed about to achieve them.\" In response, J. gives Coelho a daunting task: He must find and speak with his guardian angel. \"The curse can be broken,\" he replies, \"if you complete the task.\"<br /><br />Rising to the challenge, Paulo and his wife, Cristina, drop everything, pack their bags, and take off on a forty day adventure into the starkly beautiful and sometimes dangerous Mojave Desert where they encounter more than they bargained for. A masterful blend of the exotic locales, dramatic adventure, and magical storytelling, for which Coelho\u2032s fictional works are renowned, this true-life account is at once a modern-day adventure and a metaphysical odyssey.",

    "description": "In 1895 Hardy's final novel, the great tale of <i>Jude The Obscure</i>, sent shockwaves of indignation rolling across Victorian England. Hardy had dared to write frankly about sexuality and to indict the institutions of marriage, education, and religion. But he had, in fact, created a deeply moral work. The stonemason Jude Fawley is a dreamer; his is a tragedy of unfulfilled aims. With his tantalizing cousin Sue Bridehead, the last and most extraordinary of Hardy's heroines, Jude takes on the world and discovers, tragically, its brutal indifference. The most powerful expression of Hardy's philosophy, and a profound exploration of man's essential loneliness, <i>Jude The Obscure</i> is a great and beautiful book. 'His style touches sublimity.'\u0097T.S. Eliot",

    "description": "In this comprehensive and practical guide, the secrets of the ancient science of Tantra become available to a contemporary audience for the first time. Confined to small, hidden mystery schools for centuries, and often misunderstood and misinterpreted today. Tantra is not just a collection of techniques to enhance sexual experience. As Osho shows in these pages, it is a complete science of self-realizatoin, based on the cumulative wisdom of centuries of exploration into the meaning of life and consciousness. Tantra-the very word means \"technique\"-is a set of powerful, transformative tools that can be used to bring new meaning andjoy to every aspect of our daily lives.<br />",

    "description": "Set in the mid-1800s, this novel follows the fortunes of Eliza Sommers, Chilean by birth but adopted by a British spinster, Rose Sommers, and her bachelor brother, Jeremy, after she is abandoned on their doorstep. As Eliza grows up, she becomes less tractable, and when she falls in love with Joachin Andieta, a clerk in Jeremy's firm, her adoptive family is horrified. They are even more so when a now-pregnant Eliza follows her lover to California where he has gone to make his fortune in the 1849 gold rush. Along the way Eliza meets Tao Chi'en, a Chinese doctor who saves her life and becomes her closest friend. What starts out as a search for a lost love becomes, over time, the discovery of self; and by the time Eliza finally catches up with the elusive Joachin, she is no longer sure she still wants what she once wished for. <i>--Margaret Prior</i>",

A pinnacle of Beckett\u2019s characteristic raw minimalism, it is a pure and devastating distillation of the human essence in the face of approaching death.",

    "description": "Manil Suri's comic prose and imaginative language transport readers to the petty squabbles and unrelenting conflicts of modern-day India. At the center of the narrative is the character of Vishnu, an aging alcoholic houseboy on the precipice of death, who lies, penniless, on the bottom step of a middle-class Bombay apartment house. While Vishnu appears to face his impending death placidly and philosophically, a maelstrom swirls around him. The residents of the building include a reclusive widower mourning the untimely death of his young wife, a Moslem family coping with the daily prejudices of their Hindu neighbors, and two families who unhappily share a kitchen. Worlds collide when the Moslem family's son elopes with the Hindu family's daughter, and Mr. Jalal, the Moslem family patriarch, apparently flips his wig, recognizing Vishnu not as their dying houseboy but as the deity whose name he bears, with the power to save. And when Mr. Jalal is found sleeping on the stairs beside Vishnu, he becomes the scapegoat for the building's many ills. In its frenetic and hilarious conclusion, <i>The Death of Vishnu</i> trumpets the arrival of an extremely gifted Indian writer, bringing to spectacular life the tempestuous chaos that is life in India today. <br />(<i>Winter 2001 Selection</i>)",

    "description": "A Furious Love Is Hot on Your Trail!<br /><br />Many believers feel stunted in their Christian growth. We beat ourselves up over our failures and, in the process, pull away from God because we subconsciously believe He tallies our defects and hangs His head in disappointment. In this newly repackaged edition--now with full appendix, study questions, and the author's own epilogue, \"\"Ragamuffin\" Ten Years Later,\" Brennan Manning reminds us that nothing could be further from the truth. The Father beckons us to Himself with a \"furious love\" that burns brightly and constantly. Only when we truly embrace God's grace can we bask in the joy of a gospel that enfolds the most needy of His flock--the \"ragamuffins.\"<br /><br />Are you bedraggled, beat-up, burnt-out?<br /><br />Most of us believe in God's grace--in theory. But somehow we can't seem to apply it in our daily lives. We continue to see Him as a small-minded bookkeeper, tallying our failures and successes on a score sheet.<br /><br />Yet God gives us His grace, willingly, no matter what we've done. We come to Him as ragamuffins--dirty, bedraggled, and beat-up. And when we sit at His feet, He smiles upon us, the chosen objects of His \"furious love.\"<br /><br />Brennan Manning 's now-classic meditation on grace and what it takes to access it--simple honesty--has changed thousands of lives. Now with a Ragamuffin's thirty-day spiritual journey guide, it will change yours, too.",

Recalling the agony of growing up obsessive compulsive and a religious fanatic, Traig fearlessly confesses the most peculiar behavior like tirelessly scrubbing her hands for a full half hour before dinner, feeding her stuffed animals before herself, and washing everything she owned because she thought it was contaminated by pork fumes. The result is a book so relentlessly funny and frank, it's totally refreshing.",

    "description": "'She was still three feet away when she'd smelled it. She'd walked with death too many times to mistake it.' After a tip from a reporter, Eve Dallas finds the body of a young woman in a Delancey street dumpster. Just hours before, the news station had mysteriously received a portfolio of professional portraits of the woman.

And that these photos were taken after she had been murdered. Now Dallas is on the trail of a killer who's a perfectionist and an artist. He carefully observes and records his victim's every move.

Robb, features NYPSD (\"New York City Police and Security Department\") Lieutenant Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke and is set in a mid-21st century New York City. The stories also regularly feature other characters, including Captain Ryan Feeney, Detective Delia Peabody, Detective Ian McNab and Dr. Charlotte Mira.\n    \n    The series is ongoing and will go on as long as Roberts desires to write it; however, she has famously stated that the series will never contain one of Eve and Roarke's children, as the series will end with Eve's eventual pregnancy\u2014which is nowhere in sight at the current count.\n    \n    Please note: Each book in this series is a whole story with a beginning and an ending, however there may be minor references to events that occurred earlier in the series. Therefore, with respect to the mystery alone, the books can be read out of order, if desired. However, like any long series that focuses on a core group of characters, there are various relationship changes that develop more naturally when the full length novels are read in the order in which they were published.\n    \n    http://indeath.wikia.com/wiki/In_Death_Wiki - includes spoilers\n    \n    Eternity in Death (#24.5) was published between Innocent in Death (#24) & Creation in Death (#25).

But Suzanne and Francesca, beautiful young women caught up in trendy causes and ambitious careers, have no interest in the past. Catherine almost despairs until one night she is visited by the ghost of her family's ancestor, an indomitable Renaissance businesswoman named Hannah Mendes.<br /><br />The ghost of Hannah Mendes encourages Catherine to use every trick in the book to coerce the granddaughters to journey across Europe and acquaint themselves with their roots. While the sisters honor their grandmother's request out of loyalty, they believe their quest is futile--until it starts to uncover ancient pages from Hannah Mendes's fascinating memoir, and brings new loves into their lives.<br />",

    "description": "Parallel German text and English translation.<br /><br />The influence and popularity of Rilke\u2019s poetry in America have never been greater than they are today, more than fifty years after his death. Rilke is unquestionably the most significant and compelling poet of romantic transformation, of spiritual quest, that the twentieth century has known. His poems of ecstatic identification with the world exert a seemingly endless fascination for contemporary readers.<br /><br />In Stephen Mitchell\u2019s versions, many readers feel that they have discovered an English rendering that captures the lyric intensity, fluency, and reach of Rilke\u2019s poetry more accurately and convincingly than has ever been done before.<br /><br />Mr. Mitchell is impeccable in his adherence to Rilke\u2019s text, to his formal music, and to the complexity of his thought; at the same time, his work has authority and power as poetry in its own right. Few translators of any poet have arrived at the delicate balance of fidelity and originality that Mr. Mitchell has brought off with seeming effortlessness.<br /><br />Originally published: New York : Random House, 1982.",

Though a girl, Alanna has always craved the adventure and daring allowed only for boys; her twin brother, Thom, yearns to learn the art of magic. So one day they decide to switch places: Thom heads for the convent to learn magic; Alanna, pretending to be a boy, is on her way to the castle of King Roald to begin her training as a page. <p> But the road to knighthood is not an easy one. As Alanna masters the skills necessary for battle, she must also learn to control her heart and to discern her enemies from her allies.<br /><br />Filled with swords and sorcery, adventure and intrigue, good and evil, Alanna's first adventure begins - one that will lead to the fulfillment of her dreams and the magical destiny that will make her a legend in her land.</p>",

    "description": "'Begin at the beginning, and go on till you come to the end: then stop.'. So many readers were to take the advice of the King of Hearts that by the end of the nineteenth century the double Alice (1865 and 1872) had acquired a pre-eminent and unassailable position in children's literature. Lewis Carroll's use of logic, by which the ordinary is translated into the extraordinary in an entirely plausible way, is delightfully combined with an exceptional knowledge and understanding of the mind of the child. Satire, allusion, and symbolism weave deeper and mysterious meanings, lending a measure of immortality to Carroll's remarkable fantasy.",

    "description": "With each new book, Maeve Binchy continues a remarkable progression of sales and audience growth, reaching fans of all ages and backgrounds with her matchless wit, warmth, and sheer storytelling magic. \"Tara Road,\" her first full-length novel since \"The Glass Lake,\" again shows her incomparable understanding of the human heart in the tale of two women, one from Ireland, one from America, who switch lives, and in doing so learn much about each other, as well as much about themselves.Ria lived on Tara Road in Dublin with her dashing husband, Danny, and their two children. She fully believed she was happily married, right up until the day Danny told her he was leaving her to be with his young, pregnant girlfriend. By a chance phone call, Ria meets Marilyn, a woman from New England unable to come to terms with her only son's death and now separated from her husband. The two women exchange houses for the summer with extraordinary consequences, each learning that the other has a deep secret that can never be revealed.<br /><br />Drawn into lifestyles vastly differing from their own, at first each resents the news of how well the other is getting on. Ria seems to have become quite a hostess, entertaining half the neighborhood, which at first irritates the reserved and withdrawn Marilyn, a woman who has always guarded her privacy. Marilyn seems to have become bosom friends with Ria's children, as well as with Colm, a handsome restaurateur, whom Ria has begun to miss terribly. At the end of the summer, the women at last meet face-to-face. Having learned a great deal, about themselves and about each other, they find that they have become, firmly and forever, good friends.<br /><br />A moving story rendered with the deft touch of a master artisan, \"Tara Road\" is Maeve Binchy at her very best \u2014 utterly beautiful, hauntingly unforgettable, entirely original, and wholly enjoyable.",

He and his companions, including Reepicheep, the valiant warrior mouse, are searching for seven lost lords of Narnia, and their voyage will take them to the edge of the world. Their adventures include being captured by slave traders, a much-too-close encounter with a dragon, and visits to many enchanted islands, including the place where dreams come true.<br /><br />This edition follows the original numbering scheme. More recent publishers have re-numbered the volumes so that the books are ordered chronologically. This was reportedly the author's preference. Other editions number this book as #5.<br /><br />Please respect the title as printed.",

Considered a prodigy in scientific research, he surprised everyone and himself by setting his sights on the competitive world of high finance. Yet no sooner had he landed an entry-level position at a prestigious firm than Gardner found himself caught in a web of incredibly challenging circumstances that left him as part of the city's working homeless and with a toddler son. Motivated by the promise he made to himself as a fatherless child to never abandon his own children, the two spent almost a year moving among shelters, \"HO-tels,\" soup lines, and even sleeping in the public restroom of a subway station.<br /><br />Never giving in to despair, Gardner made an astonishing transformation from being part of the city's invisible poor to being a powerful player in its financial district.<br /><br />More than a memoir of Gardner's financial success, this is the story of a man who breaks his own family's cycle of men abandoning their children. Mythic, triumphant, and unstintingly honest, <em>The Pursuit of Happyness</em> conjures heroes like Horatio Alger and Antwone Fisher, and appeals to the very essence of the American Dream.",

With the average cost of a baby topping $6,000 for the first year alone, expectant moms and dads need all the creative solutions and cost-cutting ideas they can find. Baby Bargains is the answer. The book lists great deals and money-saving strategies for a wide variety of must-have items, from maternity wear, baby clothes, and diapers to furniture, bedding, and toys. Extensive charts allow parents to compare and contrast name-brand cribs, strollers, high chairs, child safety seats, baby monitors, and more. Now in its sixth edition, the book has been completely revised and updated to include website addresses for all major baby product manufacturers, reviews of parenting websites, and listings for mail-order catalogs and outlet stores. Additionally, the book offers important safety tips for affordably baby-proofing the home.",

Hired to manage a fishing camp deep in the Arkansas woods, the strong-willed redhead is eager to settle down - until she clashes with the camp's new owner. Simon Wright persistently dogs Nora's steps and is instantly drawn to her. But is he an ally or a charmer with his own agenda? While Nora decides, someone driven by greed will do anything to find out what she knows - and soon Nona and Simon will have nowhere to run.",

Leaving behind her only relative, her cousin Mordecai, and her first true love, Cyrus, she is thrown headlong into the unrestrained extravagance of palace living. Quick of mind and strong in spirit, she refuses to suffer the fate of her harem sisters and boldly challenges Xerxes to give of his heart before taking his pleasure, thus sealing her place beside him as queen. While conspiracy spins its diabolical web, Esther's mind and spirit waver, and she is forced to confront the past in order to save her future\u2014and that of an entire nation.",

Now, two years later, it is time for her to come to terms with marriage, career, family, parenthood, and Kevin's horrific rampage in a series of startlingly direct correspondences with her estranged husband, Franklin. Uneasy with the sacrifices and social demotion of motherhood from the start, Eva fears that her alarming dislike for her own son may be responsible for driving him so nihilistically off the rails. </p>",

    "description": "Drawing inspiration from the gnarled shrubbery of England's windswept moorlands, Brian Froud is best known for being the mad genius behind Jim Henson's film The Dark Crystal and illustrating such best-sellers as Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book. In this volume, a long-awaited sequel to his international best-sellers Faeries and Good Faeries/Bad Faeries, Froud returns to the world of faerie with a wealth of new, never-before-seen paintings, watercolors, and drawings. Brian Froud's World of Faerie offers us a startling new vision of the magical realm, enhanced by Froud's own words about his experiences and insights. This lavish, full-color book opens the door to Brian Froud's wondrous imagination as never before. It presents beautiful portrayals of faeries that have touched hearts and minds for generations. World of Faerie is by far Froud's most personal book, and represents this visionary artist and creator of fantasy worlds at the pinnacle of his powers. This encompassing volume is a must-have for faerie and fantasy fans of all ages, the world over.",

At its center is the \u201cbastard\u201d of the title, Asya, a nineteen-year-old woman who loves Johnny Cash and the French Existentialists, and the four sisters of the Kazanci family who all live together in an extended household in Istanbul: Zehila, the zestful, headstrong youngest sister who runs a tattoo parlor and is Asya\u2019s mother; Banu, who has newly discovered herself as a clairvoyant; Cevriye, a widowed high school teacher; and Feride, a hypochondriac obsessed with impending disaster. Their one estranged brother lives in Arizona with his wife and her Armenian daughter, Armanoush. When Armanoush secretly flies to Istanbul in search of her identity, she finds the Kazanci sisters and becomes fast friends with Asya. A secret is uncovered that links the two families and ties them to the 1915 Armenian deportations and massacres. Full of vigorous, unforgettable female characters, The Bastard of Istanbul is a bold, powerful tale that will confirm Shafak as a rising star of international fiction.",

    "description": "\"Gretel looked at her mother in troubled silence, wondering whether it were very wicked to care more for one parent than for the other-and sure, yes, quite sure, that she dreaded her father, while she clung to her mother with a love that was almost idolatry.\" from Hans Brinker <br /><br />A beloved childhood favorite for a century and a half-and a book that readers continue to enjoy and appreciate long into adulthood. Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates went through more than 100 editions during the author's lifetime alone. <br /><br />First published in 1865, this replica of the 1917 edition features the exquisite illustrations by Alice Carsey, whose sensitive eye and delicate pen-and-ink lines enliven the tale of the poor but virtuous Dutch boy in a way that few other artists have achieved. This replica edition brings the enchanting work of Dodge and Carsey to a new generation of children. <br /><br />Author and editor Mary Mapes Dodge (1831-1905) was born in New York City. She served as editor of the children's magazine St. Nicholas, to which she attracted such writers as Mark Twain, Louisa May Alcott, Robert Louis Stevenson, Frances Hodgson Burnett, and Rudyard Kipling. She also authored the short-fiction collection Irvington Stories (1864).",

    "description": "<em>Let it Blurt</em> is the raucous and righteous biography of Lester Bangs (1949-82)\u2013the gonzo journalist, gutter poet, and romantic visionary of rock criticism. No writer on rock \u2018n\u2019 roll ever lived harder or wrote better\u2013more passionately, more compellingly, more penetratingly. He lived the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll lifestyle, guzzling booze and Romilar like water, matching its energy in prose that erupted from the pages of <em>Rolling Stone</em>, <em>Creem</em>, and <em>The Village Voice</em>. Bangs agitated in the seventies for sounds that were harsher, louder, more electric, and more alive, in the course of which he charted and defined the aesthetics of heavy metal and punk. He was treated as a peer by such brash visionaries as Lou Reed, Patti Smith, Richard Hell, Captain Beefheart, The Clash, Debbie Harry, and other luminaries.<br /><br /><em>Let it Blurt</em> is a scrupulously researched account of Lester Bangs\u2019s fascinating (if often tawdry and unappetizing) life story, as well as a window on rock criticism and rock culture in their most turbulent and creative years. It includes a never-before-published piece by Bangs, the hilarious \"How to Be a Rock Critic,\" in which he reveals the secrets of his dubious, freeloading trade.",

    "description": "Saturday, February 15, 2003. Henry Perowne is a contented man - a successful neurosurgeon, the devoted husband of Rosalind, a newspaper lawyer, and proud father of two grown-up children, one a promising poet, the other a talented blues musician. Unusually, he wakes before dawn, drawn to the window of his bedroom and filled with a growing unease. What troubles him as he looks out at the night sky is the state of the world - the impending war against Iraq, a gathering pessimism since 9/11, and a fear that his city, its openness and diversity, and his happy family life are under threat. Later, Perowne makes his way to his weekly squash game through London streets filled with hundreds of thousands of anti-war protestors. A minor car accident brings him into a confrontation with Baxter, a fidgety, aggressive, young man, on the edge of violence. To Perowne's professional eye, there appears to be something profoundly wrong with him. Towards the end of a day rich in incident and filled with Perowne's celebrations of life's pleasures - music, food, love, the exhilarations of sport and the satisfactions of exacting work - his family gathers for a reunion. But with the sudden appearance of Baxter, Perowne's earlier fears seem about to be realised. Ian McEwan's last novel, Atonement, was hailed as a masterpiece all over the world. Saturday shares its confident, graceful prose and its remarkable perceptiveness, but is perhaps even more dramatically compelling, showing how life can change in an instant, for better or for worse. It is the work of a writer at the very height of his powers.",

    "description": "Gripping, tragic, and densely atmospheric\u2014a masterpiece of suspense which leaves us shaken and changed.<br /><br />Winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award 1995 and the American Booksellers Association Book of the Year Award<br /><br />San Piedro Island, north of Puget Sound, is a place so isolated that no one who lives there can afford to make enemies. But in 1954 a local fisherman is found suspiciously drowned, and a Japanese American named Kabuo Miyamoto is charged with his murder. In the course of the ensuing trial, it becomes clear that what is at stake is more than a man's guilt. For on San Pedro, memory grows as thickly as cedar trees and the fields of ripe strawberries\u2014memories of a charmed love affair between a white boy and the Japanese girl who grew up to become Kabuo's wife; memories of land desired, paid for, and lost. Above all, San Piedro is haunted by the memory of what happened to its Japanese residents during World War II, when an entire community was sent into exile while its neighbors watched. Gripping, tragic, and densely atmospheric, Snow Falling on Cedars is a masterpiece of suspense\u2014one that leaves us shaken and changed.",

    "description": "The age of the Talmud is brought to life in a breathtaking saga. This masterpiece of modern fiction tells the gripping tale of renegade talmudic sage Elisha ben Abuyah's struggle to reconcile his faith with the allure of Hellenistic culture. Set in Roman Palestine, As a Driven Leaf draws readers into the dramatic era of Rabbinic Judaism. Watch the great Talmudic sages at work in the Sanhedrin, eavesdrop on their arguments about theology and Torah, and agonize with them as they contemplate rebellion against an oppressive Roman rule. But Steinberg's classic novel also transcends its historical setting with its depiction of a timeless, perennial feature of the Jewish experience: the inevitable conflict between the call of tradition and the glamour of the surrounding culture. In his illuminating foreword, specially commissioned for this edition, Chaim Potok stresses the contemporary relevance of As a Driven Leaf: This novel of ideas and passions. . . retains its ability to enter the heart of pious and seeking Jew alike. Synagogues everywhere are adopting As a Driven Leaf for group study.",

    "description": "This Edwardian social comedy explores love and prim propriety among an eccentric cast of characters assembled in an Italian pensione and in a corner of Surrey, England. A charming young English woman, Lucy Honeychurch, faints into the arms of a fellow Britisher when she witnesses a murder in a Florentine piazza. Attracted to this man, George Emerson, who is entirely unsuitable and whose father just may be a Socialist. Lucy is soon at war with the snobbery of her class and her own conflicting desires. Back in England she is courted by a more acceptable, if stifling, suitor, and soon realizes she must make a startling decision that will decide the course of her future: she is forced to choose between convention and passion. The enduring delight of this tale of romantic intrigue is rooted in Forster's colorful characters, including outrageous spinsters, pompous clergymen and outspoken patriots. Written in 1908, <i>A Room With A View</i> is one of E.M. Forster's earliest and most celebrated works.",

    "description": "<b>FANTASIA tells of her astonishing rise from hopeless high school dropout to <i>American Idol</i> superstar in the inspirational <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Life Is Not a Fairy Tale</i></b> <br /><br /> In one moment, with one tearful performance of \"Summertime,\" the nineteen-year-old Fantasia captured the hearts -- and the votes -- of millions of <i>American Idol</i> fans. Her powerful voice and independent style made her an overnight national sensation. But life wasn't always sensational for Fantasia. <br /><br /> At the age of seventeen, despite the promise of her extraordinary voice, Fantasia was in danger of becoming just another sad statistic: an uneducated, unmarried teenage mother living in the projects. But Fantasia had been raised by two strong, influential women: Both her grandmother and mother are preachers, and she was raised with an unshakable faith. In <i>Life Is Not a Fairy Tale,</i> Fantasia speaks -- with a spirit as strong as her voice -- about what it takes to believe in the power of one's self. She turns all that she's learned into uplifting life lessons, including: <br /><br /><b>\u2022 Recognize your gift <br /> \u2022 You made your bed, now lie in it <br /> \u2022 Give props where props are due <br /> \u2022 Like mother, like daughter <br /> \u2022 It ain't about the bling</b> <br /><br /> Fantasia keeps it real with her sassy, self-confident style and down-to-earth advice, making readers laugh and cry with her. <i>Life Is Not a Fairy Tale</i> is more than just a celebrity success story. It's a book of revelations that will inspire all readers to reach for their greatest potential.",

    "description": "Shock jock extraordinaire Wendy Williams lets loose with the first in a series of novels based on her alter ego, the divalicious radio DJ Ritz Harper. Ritz puts the <i>s</i> in shock and the <i>g</i> in gossip, and Drama is her middle name. <br /><br />Ritz is a suburban girl on the outside, but inside she\u2019s a hustler\u2019s hustler who\u2019s masterfully maneuvered her way into the spotlight after ruining the career of a well-respected newswoman (and former college friend). Ritz\u2019s \u201cexclusive\u201d rockets her to the top of the ratings, and she\u2019s rewarded with her very own show. Like a talking Venus flytrap, she verbally seduces her on-air guests, only to have them for lunch as she spews gossip about their lives.<br /><br />Ritz becomes the darling of the station\u2019s afternoon slot. But what happens when Ritz goes from drive-time diva to drive-by victim? Has Ritz bad-mouthed the wrong person? Has her signature cat-and-mouse \u201cbomb drop\u201d been dropped on her instead?<br /><br />As Ritz lies crumpled on a city sidewalk, all she can think as she struggles to maintain consciousness is \u201cWho did this to me? Who?\u201d<br /><br />Readers will salivate as they try to figure out where the fictional Ritz ends and the real-life Wendy begins. Wendy will involve her millions of listeners by asking them what should happen to Ritz, which will be revealed at the beginning of the next novel, scheduled to be published in fall of 2006 for Christmas.",

    "description": "<i>Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo</i> tells the story of a cultural moment that's happening right now-the nexus point where teen culture, music, and the web converge to create something new.<br /><br />While shallow celebrities dominate the headlines, pundits bemoan the death of the music industry, and the government decries teenagers for their morals (or lack thereof) earnest, heartfelt bands like Dashboard Confessional, Jimmy Eat World, and Thursday are quietly selling hundreds of thousands of albums through dedication, relentless touring and respect for their fans. This relationship - between young people and the empathetic music that sets them off down a road of self-discovery and self-definition - is emo, a much-maligned, mocked, and misunderstood term that has existed for nearly two decades, but has flourished only recently. In <i>Nothing Feels Good</i>, Andy Greenwald makes the case for emo as more than a genre - it's an essential rite of teenagehood. From the '80s to the '00s, from the basement to the stadium, from tour buses to chat rooms, and from the diary to the computer screen, <i>Nothing Feels Good</i> narrates the story of emo from the inside out and explores the way this movement is taking shape in real time and with real hearts on the line. <i>Nothing Feels Good </i>is the first book to explore this exciting moment in music history and Greenwald has been given unprecedented access to the bands and to their fans. He captures a place in time and a moment on the stage in a way only a true music fan can.",

He\u2019s very sick, and watching his condition deteriorate as the summer passes is almost more than Vicky can bear.

Leo Rodney has been just a friend for years, but the tragic loss of his father causes him to turn to Vicky for comfort\u2014and romance. And then there\u2019s Adam Eddington. Adam is only asking Vicky to help with his research on dolphins. But Adam\u2014and the dolphins\u2014may just be what Vicky needs to get through this heartbreaking summer.",

The vigilante slayings eerily echo the work of a serial killer from a decade ago, and convince Alex that \"the Exterminators,\" as a grateful public has dubbed them, are more ruthless and sadistic than their victims. As the attacks mount, it is the ninth target that pulls Alex into a case that is quickly spiraling into deadly territory -- where justice is no longer enough.",

    "description": "The decade and a half that followed World War I was a time of tremendous optimism in Harlem. It was a time when Langston Hughes, Eubie Blake, Marcus Garvey, Zora Neale Hurston, Paul Robeson, and countless others made their indelible mark on the landscape of American culture: African Americans made their first appearances on Broadway; chic supper clubs opened on Harlem streets, their whites-only audiences in search of the ultimate 'primitive' experience; riotous rent parties kept economic realties at the bay while the rich and famous of both races outdid each other with elegant, integrated soirees. David Levering Lewis makes us feel the excitement of the times as he recaptures the intoxicating hope that black Americans could now create important art--and so at last compel the nation to recognize their equality. <br /><br />In his new preface, the author reconsiders the Harlem Renaissance in light of criticism surrounding the exploitation of the black community. For, as he point out, 'speculations about molded the Harlem Renaissance and who found it most beneficial, as well as what it symbolized and what it actually achieved, raise questions about race relations, class hegemony, cultural assimilation, generation-gender-lifestyle tensions, and art propaganda.",

    "description": "The 1950s phenomenon of Roller Derby is back in full force, and it's definitely not your grandma's game anymore. With leagues in more than one hundred cities across the country, a national tournament, and major sponsors, the new wave of the sport has gone mainstream. No one is better qualified to tell the story of Flat Track Derby's astronomic rise than Melissa \"Melicious\" Joulwan. As a founding member of the Texas Rollergirls -- the league that launched the sport and the reigning national champions -- she has helped redefine what it means to be stylish, sporty, and sexy. <p> With her mouthy, tough-as-nails style, Melicious recounts her best tales from the track: her fierce rivalries with The Wrench and Ivanna S. Pankin, the scene at the annual national tournament, the thrill of a bout, and the infractions that so often bring her to the penalty box. From the minute she first laced up her skates and wrapped herself in her alter ego, Roller Derby has given her a confidence boost, and she shares the positive impact the sport has also had on girls -- young and not-so-young -- who tack posters of her on their bedroom walls and lace up their own skates. </p><p> Complete with photos and suggestions on how to develop a Rollergirl name and persona, this unprecedented tell-all comes from the woman who's watched the sport evolve from an underground Friday-night event to a bona fide national phenomenon.</p>",

In volume two of his collected works, the plays and revue sketches mark a period of transition, as Pinter's characters and settings become more recognizably realistic, in contrast to the absurdist atmosphere of his earlier work.<br /><i>The Caretaker</i>, which first brought him fame on both sides of the Atlantic, was called \"a play of strangely compelling beauty and passion\" by Howard Taubman of <i>The New York Times</i>. An essay by Pinter, <i>Writing for Myself</i>, introduces this collection.",

    "description": "<div>From Michael Cunningham, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>The Hours</i>, comes this widely praised novel of two boyhood friends: Jonathan, lonely, introspective, and unsure of himself; and Bobby, hip, dark, and inarticulate. In New York after college, Bobby moves in with Jonathan and his roommate, Clare, a veteran of the city's erotic wars. Bobby and Clare fall in love, scuttling the plans of Jonathan, who is gay, to father Clare's child. Then, when Clare and Bobby have a baby, the three move to a small house upstate to raise \"their\" child together and, with an odd friend, Alice, create a new kind of family. <i>A Home at the End of the World</i> masterfully depicts the charged, fragile relationships of urban life today.<br /></div>",

    "description": "<div>In this volume, the distinguished East German writer Christa Wolf retells the story of the fall of Troy, but from the point of view of the woman whose visionary powers earned her contempt and scorn. Written as a result of the author's Greek travels and studies, <i>Cassandra</i> speaks to us in a pressing monologue whose inner focal points are patriarchy and war. In the four accompanying pieces, which take the form of travel reports, journal entries, and a letter, Wolf describes the novel's genesis. Incisive and intelligent, the entire volume represents an urgent call to examine the past in order to insure a future.<br /></div>",

The dead man was a CIA agent. To make matters worse, the apparent culprit is sweet-natured Chanya, the brothel\u2019s top earner and a woman whom the devoutly Buddhist sleuth has loved for several lifetimes. How can Sonchai solve this crime without sending Chanya to prison? How can he engage in a cover-up without endangering his karma? And how will he ever get to the bottom of a case whose interested parties include American spooks, Muslim fundamentalists, and gangsters from three countries? As addictive as opium, as hot as Sriracha chili sauce, and bursting with surprises, <i>Bangkok Tattoo</i> will leave its mark on you.",

Why do we do it? Why do we hide it when we do it? And why do we find farts so darn funny? A cut above anything else on the subject, this book really lets go and tells all, getting to the bottom of these mysteries. Author Jim sniffs out a load of historical and scientific fart tales, then offers the kind of fun facts you'll be dying to let slip at social occasions, in chapters like \"Fart Facts That Aren't Just Hot Air,\" \"Gone with the Wind\" (on famous movie farts), and \"Le Petomane &amp; the Art of the Fart\" (on the most famous windbag in history). From fact to fiction to frivolous flatulence, this book is unquestionably a ripping good read.",

Constantine Stassos, a Greek immigrant, marries Mary Cuccio, an Italian-American girl, and they have three children, each fated to a complex life. Susan is oppressed by her beauty and her father's affections; Billy is brilliant, and gay; Zoe is a wild, heedless visionary. As the years pass, their lives unfold in ways that compel them--and their parents--to meet ever greater challenges.",

The intense emotional situation envelops the readers from the first page; like all images in a dream, White's characters are the most real people we know, thought they remain phantoms. Each chapter, each nocturne, is set in a different emotional key, but all are interconnected through such subtle modulations that the final effect is devastating.<br />",

    "description": "Not only is it the world's largest and most watched sporting event, but also the most fearsome physical challenge ever conceived by man, demanding every last ounce of will and strength, every last drop of blood, sweat, and tears. If ever there was an athletic exploit specifically not for the faint of heart and feeble of limb, this is it. So you might ask, what is Tim Moore doing cycling it?<br /><br />An extremely good question. Ignoring the pleading dictates of reason and common sense, Moore determined to tackle the Tour de France, all 2,256 miles of it, in the weeks before the professionals entered the stage. This decision was one he would regret for nearly its entire length. But readers--those who now know Moore's name deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Bill Bryson and Calvin Trillin--will feel otherwise. They are in for a side-splitting treat.<br /><br /><i>French Revolutions</i> gives us a hilariously unforgettable account of Moore's attempt to conquer the Tour de France. \"Conquer\" may not be quite the right word. He cheats when he can, pops the occasional hayfever pill for an ephedrine rush (a fine old Tour tradition), sips cheap wine from his water bottle, and occasionally weeps on the phone to his wife. But along the way he gives readers an account of the race's colorful history and greatest heroes: Eddy Merckx, Greg Lemond, Lance Armstrong, and even Firmin Lambot, aka the \"Lucky Belgian,\" who won the race at the age of 36. Fans of the Tour de France will learn why the yellow jersey is yellow, and how cyclists learned to save precious seconds (a race that lasts for three weeks is all about split seconds) by relieving themselves en route. And if that isn't enough, his account of a rural France tarting itself up for its moment in the spotlight leaves popular quaint descriptions of small towns in Provence in the proverbial dust. If you either love or hate the French, or both, you'll want to travel along with Time Moore.<br /><br /><i>French Revolutions</i> is Tim Moore's funniest book to date. It is also one of the funniest sports books ever written.",

Anita lives in a parallel universe, much like our own, save that not only do things like vampires and shapeshifters exist, but their presence is public knowledge. The novels follow Anita's conflicts with the supernatural as she attempts to solve a variety of mysteries, come to terms with her abilities, and navigate a complex series of romantic and political relationships. <i>(edited from Wikipedia)</i>\n    \n    Please note: Each book in this series is a whole story with a beginning and an ending, however the plot of each book relies heavily on the prior books in the series. It is recommended that you read the full length novels - including the novellas like \"Micah\" and \"Flirt\" - in the order they were published. At this time, the author has no plans on ending the series.\n    \n    See also <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/69802-anita-blake-vampire-hunter-graphic-novels\">the graphic novel adaptations</a>.\n    \n    Reading Order per author's <a href=\"http://www.laurellkhamilton.org/works/\">website</a> & Facebook posting <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/laurell-k-hamilton/current-list-of-anita-blake-works/10152399083544352\">Current List of Anita Blake Works</a>.",

    "description": "When Adela Quested and her elderly companion Mrs Moore arrive in the Indian town of Chandrapore, they quickly feel trapped by its insular and prejudiced 'Anglo-Indian' community. Determined to escape the parochial English enclave and explore the 'real India', they seek the guidance of the charming and mercurial Dr Aziz, a cultivated Indian Muslim. But a mysterious incident occurs while they are exploring the Marabar caves with Aziz, and the well-respected doctor soon finds himself at the centre of a scandal that rouses violent passions among both the British and their Indian subjects. A masterful portrait of a society in the grip of imperialism, <i>A Passage to India</i> compellingly depicts the fate of individuals caught between the great political and cultural conflicts of the modern world. <br /><br />In his introduction, Pankaj Mishra outlines Forster's complex engagement with Indian society and culture. This edition reproduces the Abinger text and notes, and also includes four of Forster's essays on India, a chronology and further reading.",

    "description": "Since the early 1980s, when the federal courts began dismantling the landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, segregation of black children has reverted to its highest level since 1968. In many inner-city schools, a stick-and-carrot method of behavioral control traditionally used in prisons is now used with students. Meanwhile, as high-stakes testing takes on pathological and punitive dimensions, liberal education has been increasingly replaced by culturally barren and robotic methods of instruction that would be rejected out of hand by schools that serve the mainstream of society.<br /><br />Filled with the passionate voices of children, principals, and teachers, and some of the most revered leaders in the black community, <i>The Shame of the Nation</i> pays tribute to those undefeated educators who persist against the odds, but directly challenges the chilling practices now being forced upon our urban systems. In their place, Kozol offers a humane, dramatic challenge to our nation to fulfill at last the promise made some 50 years ago to all our youngest citizens.",

    "description": "<i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>, by <b>Fyodor Dostoevsky</b>, is part of the <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i><i>\u00a0</i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i>:<br />All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics </i>pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.<br />\u00a0<br /><br />The last and greatest of <b>Dostoevsky</b>\u2019s novels, <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> is a towering masterpiece of literature, philosophy, psychology, and religion. It tells the story of intellectual Ivan, sensual Dmitri, and idealistic Alyosha Karamazov, who collide in the wake of their despicable father\u2019s brutal murder.<br /><br />Into the framework of the story Dostoevsky poured all of his deepest concerns\u2014the origin of evil, the nature of freedom, the craving for meaning and, most importantly, whether God exists. The novel is famous for three chapters that may be ranked among the greatest pages of Western literature. \u201cRebellion\u201d and \u201cThe Grand Inquisitor\u201d present what many have considered the strongest arguments ever formulated against the existence of God, while \u201cThe Devil\u201d brilliantly portrays the banality of evil. Ultimately, Dostoevsky believes that Christ-like love prevails. But does he prove it?<br /><br />A rich, moving exploration of the critical questions of human existence, <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> powerfully challenges all readers to reevaluate the world and their place in it.<br /><br />\u00a0<br /><br /><b>Maire Jaanus</b> is Professor of English and department Chair at Barnard College, Columbia University. She is the author of <i>Georg Trakl</i>, <i>Literature and Negation</i>, and a novel, <i>She</i>, and co-editor of <i>Reading Seminars I and II</i>, <i>Reading Seminar XI</i>, and the forthcoming <i>Lacan in the German-Speaking World</i>.",

With devastating clarity, Gilligan traces the role that shame plays in the etiology of murder and explains why our present penal system only exacerbates it. Brilliantly argued, harrowing in its portraits of the walking dead, <b>Violence</b> should be read by anyone concerned with this national epidemic and its widespread consequences.",

    "description": "With World War II finally ending, Jake Geismar, former Berlin correspondent for CBS, has wangled one of the coveted press slots for the Potsdam Conference. His assignment: a series of articles on the Allied occupation. His personal agenda: to find Lena, the German mistress he left behind at the outbreak of the war. <p> When Jake stumbles on a murder -- an American soldier washes up on the conference grounds -- he thinks he has found the key that will unlock his Berlin story. What Jake finds instead is a larger story of corruption and intrigue reaching deep into the heart of the occupation. Berlin in July 1945 is like nowhere else -- a tragedy, and a feverish party after the end of the world. </p><p> As Jake searches the ruins for Lena, he discovers that years of war have led to unimaginable displacement and degradation. As he hunts for the soldier's killer, he learns that Berlin has become a city of secrets, a lunar landscape that seethes with social and political tension. When the two searches become entangled, Jake comes to understand that the American Military Government is already fighting a new enemy in the east, busily identifying the \"good Germans\" who can help win the next war. And hanging over everything is the larger crime, a crime so huge that it seems -- the worst irony -- beyond punishment. </p><p> At once a murder mystery, a moving love story, and a riveting portrait of a unique time and place, <i>The Good German</i> is a historical thriller of the first rank.</p>",

    "description": "The year is 2380. The Intersolar Commonwealth, a sphere of stars some four hundred light-years in diameter, contains more than six hundred worlds, interconnected by a web of transport \"tunnels\" known as wormholes. At the farthest edge of the Commonwealth, astronomer Dudley Bose observes the impossible: Over one thousand light-years away, a star... vanishes. It does not go supernova. It does not collapse into a black hole. It simply disappears. Since the location is too distant to reach by wormhole, a faster-than-light starship, the <i>Second Chance</i>, is dispatched to learn what has occurred and whether it represents a threat. In command is Wilson Kime, a five-time rejuvenated ex-NASA pilot whose glory days are centuries behind him.<br /><br />Opposed to the mission are the Guardians of Selfhood, a cult that believes the human race is being manipulated by an alien entity they call the Starflyer. Bradley Johansson, leader of the Guardians, warns of sabotage, fearing the Starflyer means to use the starship's mission for its own ends.<br /><br />Pursued by a Commonwealth special agent convinced the Guardians are crazy but dangerous, Johansson flees. But the danger is not averted. Aboard the Second Chance, Kime wonders if his crew has been infiltrated. Soon enough, he will have other worries. A thousand light-years away, something truly incredible is waiting: a deadly discovery whose unleashing will threaten to destroy the Commonwealth... and humanity itself. Could it be that Johansson was right?",

    "description": "In the fourth volume of the acclaimed Hinges of History series, Thomas Cahill brings his characteristic wit and style to a fascinating tour of ancient Greece.<br /><br />The Greeks invented everything from Western warfare to mystical prayer, from logic to statecraft. Many of their achievements, particularly in art and philosophy, are widely celebrated; other important innovations and accomplishments, however, are unknown or under-appreciated. In Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea, Thomas Cahill explores the legacy, good and bad, of the ancient Greeks. From the origins of Greek culture in the migrations of armed Indo-European tribes into Attica and the Peloponnesian peninsula, to the formation of the city-states, to the birth of Western literature, poetry, drama, philosophy, art, and architecture, Cahill makes the distant past relevant to the present.<br /><br />Greek society is one of the two primeval influences on the Western world: While Jews gave us our value system, the Greeks set the foundation and framework for our intellectual lives. They are responsible for our vocabulary, our logic, and our entire system of categorization. They provided the intellectual tools we bring to bear on problems in philosophy, mathematics, medicine, physics, and the other sciences. Their modes of thinking, considered in classical times to be the pinnacle of human achievement, are largely responsible for the shape that the Christian religion took. But, as Cahill points out, the Greeks left a less appealing bequest as well. They created Western militarism and, in making the warrior the ultimate ideal, perpetrated the assumption that only males could be entrusted with the duties of citizenship. The consequences of their exclusion of women from the political sphere and the social segregation of the sexes continue to reverberate today. Full of surprising, often controversial, insights, Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea is a remarkable intellectual adventure\u2014conducted by the most companionable guide imaginable. Cahill\u2019s knowledge of his sources is so intimate that he has made his own fresh translations of the Greek lyric poets for this volume.",

And surely this is, often enough, an adequate description. But history is also the narratives of grace, the recountings of those blessed and inexplicable moments when someone did something for someone else, saved a life, bestowed a gift, gave something beyond what was required by circumstance. - Thomas Cahill",

In addition to the obvious order - starting with Volume I and continuing in numerical sequence- the author suggests that those who began with Volume II may find it convenient to continue with Volumes III and Volume IV before reading Volume I.",

Appropriate \"reader friendly\" type sizes have been chosen for each title\u2014offering clear, accurate, and readable text. All editions are complete and unabridged, and feature Introductions and Afterwords.<br /><br />This edition of <i>Frankenstein</i> includes a Foreword, Biographical Note, and Afterword by Keith Neilson.<br /><br />When obsessed university student Victor Frankenstein finds the secret of animating dead flesh, he tries to create the first of a master race, stitching rotting corpses into a superhuman giant. Then the ghastly thing opens its hideous, soulless eyes and Frankenstein flees into the night, shrieking with horror--<br /><br />Leaving a being who wants love and finds hate, wants friends and finds enemies, wants another and finds no one. Frankenstein is its father, mother, maker and living god, and Frankenstein has abandonded his own monster to a living hell of unutterable isolation. But now, unstoppable, the creature means to get revenge for having been born--<br /><br />Not by killing its creator...but by destroying everything holds dear, and everyone Frankenstein loves...<br /></div>",

    "description": "One of the sinuous and subtly crafted stories in Tobias Wolff's new collection--his first in eleven years--begins with a man biting a dog. The fact that Wolff is reversing familiar expectations is only half the point. The other half is that Wolff makes the reversal seem inevitable: the dog has attacked his protagonist's young daughter. And everywhere in The Night in Question, we are reminded that truth is deceptive, volatile, and often the last thing we want to know.<br />A young reporter writes an obituary only to be fired when its subject walks into his office, very much alive. A soldier in Vietnam goads his lieutenant into sending him on increasingly dangerous missions. An impecunious mother and son go window-shopping for a domesticity that is forever beyond their grasp. Seamless, ironic, dizzying in their emotional aptness, these fifteen stories deliver small, exquisite shocks that leave us feeling invigorated and intensely alive.",

    "description": "<i>The\u00a0Russian Debutante's Handbook </i>introduces Vladimir Girshkin, one of the most original and unlikely heroes of recent times. The twenty-five-year-old unhappy lover to a fat dungeon mistress, affectionately nicknamed \"Little Failure\" by his high-achieving mother, Vladimir toils his days away as a lowly clerk at the bureaucratic Emma Lazarus Immigrant Absorption Society. When a wealthy but psychotic old Russian war hero appears, Vladimir embarks on an adventure of unrelenting lunacy that takes us from New York's Lower East Side to the hip frontier wilderness of Prava--the Eastern European Paris of the nineties. With the help of a murderous but fun-loving Russian mafioso, Vladimir infiltrates the Prava expat community and launches a scheme as ridiculous as it is brilliant.<br /><br />Bursting with wit, humor, and rare insight, <i>The Russian Debutante's Handbook </i>is both a highly imaginative romp and a serious exploration of what it means to be an immigrant in America.",

Eleven-year-old Lucius Priest is persuaded by Boon Hogganbeck, one of his family's retainers, to steal his grandfather's car and make a trip to Memphis. The Priests' black coachman, Ned McCaslin, stows away, and the three of them are off on a heroic odyssey, for which they are all ill-equipped, that ends at Miss Reba's bordello in Memphis. From there a series of wild misadventures ensues--invoving horse smuggling, trainmen, sheriffs' deputies, and jail.",

In Schneider's Berlin, real people cross the Wall not to defect but to quarrel with their lovers, see Hollywood movies, and sometimes just because they can't help themselves\u2014the Wall has divided their emotions as much as it has their country.<br /><br />\"An honest, rich book. . . . It is one those rare books that come back at odd moments to intrude on your comfortable conclusions and easy images.\"\u2014Robert Houston, <i>Nation</i><br />",

Her often surprising discoveries about the conditions of and attitudes toward women around the world -- and the exquisitely embroidered amalgam of clear-eyed autobiography and dazzling meta-fiction by which she relates those assorted discoveries -- add up to a deliciously wry, engagingly cosmopolitan, and deeply penetrating narrative.",

    "description": "Due to its original content, the novel became a favorite text of academics who subscribe to New Criticism. The novel has had differing interpretations, often mutually exclusive. Many critics have tried to determine the exact nature of the evil hinted at by the story. However, others have argued that the true brilliance of the novel comes with its ability to create an intimate confusion and suspense for the reader. THE TURN OF THE SCREW is the greatest and most subtle of all English-language ghost stories. H.P. Lovecraft praised its -truly potent air of sinister menace- and -mounting tide of fright- and subsequent critics have argued long and hard over the central -problem- of the story: if the motifs of the traditional ghost story, in the hands of a master, are used to probe the deepest depths of the human psyche, do the resultant terrors spring from the objective return of the spirits of the dead, or from the fears, memories, and guilt the expectation of such apparitions may evoke? Are there any ghosts in this story at all? James himself might have been puzzled by that question. His own remarks make it clear that what he had in mind was a -sinister romance, - inspired by a ghostly story he had heard from an Archbishop of Canterbury. He wrote of the -portentous evil- of the -demon-spirits- in the story, but it was his genius to make them so profoundly mysterious.",

    "description": "As both a masterpiece of Russian populist writing and a parody of the entire genre, \"Poor People\" is an early example of Dostoevsky's genius. Written as a series of letters, \"Poor People\" tells the tragic tale of a petty clerk and his impossible love for a young girl. Longing to help her and her family, he sells everything he can, but his kindness leads him only into more desperate poverty, and ultimately into debauchery. As a typical \"man of the underground,\" he serves as the embodiment of the belief that happiness can only be achieved with riches.",

Instead, he put his work in the service of the imperialist movement that led Japan into World War II. <br /><br />Now, as the mature Ono struggles through the aftermath of that war, his memories of his youth and of the \u201cfloating world\u201d\u2014the nocturnal world of pleasure, entertainment, and drink\u2014offer him both escape and redemption, even as they punish him for betraying his early promise. Indicted by society for its defeat and reviled for his past aesthetics, he relives the passage through his personal history that makes him both a hero and a coward but, above all, a human being.",

    "description": "To Libby Mason, Mr. Right has always meant Mr. Rich. A twenty seven-year-old publicist, she's barely able to afford her fashionable and fabulous lifestyle and often has to foot the bill for dates with Struggling Writer Nick, a sexy but perpetually strapped-for-cash guy she's dating (no commitments \u2013 really). So when Ed, Britain's wealthiest but stodgiest bachelor, enters the picture, her idea of the fairy tale romance is turned on it's head. <br /><br /><b>Mr. Maybe</b> is the tale of her heartfelt but hilarious deliberation, irresistibly chronicled by bestselling author <b>Jane Green</b>. On one hand, Nick makes up for his low bank-account balance by his performance in the sack, or in the bathtub, as the case may be. But life with him means little more than nightly trips to the bar, a dark and grungy apartment, and plenty of dull political tirades to boot. But those blue eyes, and that tender heart...<br /><br />On the other hand, there's Ed, whose luxurious house and gargantuan bank account are quite tempting to the starving Libby. But his unsavory mustache and bumbling ways make Libby wonder if the platinum AMEX and unlimited \"retail therapy\" are worth it. He may have fallen in love with her at first sight, but nothing seems to solve his lackluster performance in the sack \u2013 even speed reading The Joy of Sex. When the diamond shopping commences, Libby is forced to realize that the time for \"maybe\" is up. <br /><br /><i>Taking romantic comedy to a hip, sparkling new level, <b>Mr. Maybe</b> is a classic tale of what happens to one girl when her heart and her head aren't looking for the same thing. With a laugh and minute and a heroine whose struggles in the dating jungle will remind you of your own, Mr. Maybe is a story that all will leave you smitten.</i>",

Penelope che non si rassegna al ruolo domestico di chi tesse la tela aspettando il ritorno di Ulisse, ma, Ulisse lei stessa, Gi\u00f2 viaggia alla ricerca della sua identit\u00e0 e della sua libert\u00e0. Si disfa con freddezza della sua verginit\u00e0, si innamora con ribellione di un uomo debole e incerto che si rivela omosessuale, affronta con coraggio il triangolo in cui si trova coinvolta da Richard (l'uomo che ama) e Bill (l'uomo amato da Richard). Dieci anni dopo, il volto di Gi\u00f2, la protagonista di questo romanzo, potrebbe essere quello dell'io narrante di \"Lettera a un bambino mai nato\".",

In <i>McCarthy's Bar</i>, his journey begins in Cork and continues along the west coast to Donegal in the north. Traveling through spectacular landscapes, but at all times obeying the rule, \"never pass a bar that has your name on it,\" he encounters McCarthy's bars up and down the land, meeting fascinating people before pleading to be let out at four o'clock in the morning.<br /><br />Written by someone who is at once an insider and an outside, <i>McCarthy's Bar</i> is a wonderfully funny and affectionate portrait of a rapidly changing country.",

    "description": "Visible on a clear day off the west coast of Ireland, the Skellig Islands, a cluster of cruel rocks, rise spectacularly from the Atlantic Ocean. A sanctuary to birds and seals today, for over six hundred years during the middle ages it was a center for a particularly intense form of monastic life, one that acclaimed writer Geoffrey Moorhouse explores with utmost fascination, scholarship, and imagination in Sun Dancing. A must read for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of Celtic spirituality, Moorhouse's lively narrative is a superbly imagined account of the monks' isolated life-the spiritual struggles and triumphs and unbelievable physical hardships. To complement and enrich the book, Moorhouse establishes the historical context of Irish monasticism and describes the monks' influence and undeniable role in preserving western civilization, as well as unexpected connections between medieval Ireland and India, Egypt, and Byzantium, and the surviving impact of pagan mythology. An entertaining and enlightening work, Sun Dancing makes medieval Ireland come alive.<br />",

    "description": "This edition of Michael Wood's groundbreaking first book explores the fascinating and mysterious centuries between the Romans and the Norman Conquest of 1066. In Search of the Dark Ages vividly conjures up some of the most famous names in British history, such as Queen Boadicea, leader of a terrible war of resistance against the Romans, and King Arthur, the 'once and future king', for whose riddle Wood proposes a new and surprising solution. Here too, warts and all, are the Saxon, Viking and Norman kings who laid the political foundations of England - Offa of Mercia, Alfred the Great, Athelstan, and William the Conqueror, whose victory at Hastings in 1066 marked the end of Anglo-Saxon England.<br /><br />Reflecting recent historical, textual and archaeological research, this revised edition of Michael Wood's classic book overturns preconceptions of the Dark Ages as a shadowy and brutal era, showing them to be a richly exciting and formative period in the history of Britain.<br /><br />\u2014'With In Search of the Dark Ages, Michael Wood wrote the book for history on TV.' The Times<br /><br />\u2014'Michael Wood is the maker of some of the best TV documentaries ever made on history and archaeology.' Times Literary Supplement",

Their quest would eventually engulf all of physics and astronomy, leading not only to the discovery of quasars, black holes, and shadow matter but also to fame, controversy, and Nobel Prizes. Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos tells the story of the men and women who have taken eternity on their shoulders and stormed nature in search of answers to the deepest questions we know to ask.",

    "description": "Considered by some to be the greatest novel ever written, <i>Anna Karenina</i> is Tolstoy's classic tale of love and adultery set against the backdrop of high society in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. A rich and complex masterpiece, the novel charts the disastrous course of a love affair between Anna, a beautiful married woman, and Count Vronsky, a wealthy army officer. Tolstoy seamlessly weaves together the lives of dozens of characters, and in doing so captures a breathtaking tapestry of late-nineteenth-century Russian society. As Matthew Arnold wrote in his celebrated essay on Tolstoy, \"We are not to take <i>Anna Karenina</i> as a work of art; we are to take it as a piece of life.\"",

Combining Richard Howard's translation with restored original art, this definitive English-language edition of<i> The Little Prince</i> will capture the hearts of readers of all ages.<br /><br />This title has been selected as a Common Core Text Exemplar (Grades 4-5, Stories).",

    "description": "While the influence of Chekhov in modern theater worldwide, and especially in America, has been immense, translations into English have tended to be too literary and have not communicated the full emotional power and precise attention to detail of Chekhov's Russian. Milton Ehre began translating Chekhov's plays to provide professional theaters with performance texts that capture the feel and rhythms of spoken, rather than written, language. <i>Chekhov for the Stage</i> is the first publication of his revised versions of <i>The Three Sisters, Uncle Vanya, The Cherry Orchard,</i> and <i>The Sea Gull.</i> Ehre's sensitive renderings of these classics make this volume the translation of choice for performers and directors, teachers, and the general reading public.<br />",

    "description": "Harold McGee's <i>On Food and Cooking</i> is a kitchen classic. Hailed by <i>Time</i> magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, <i>On Food and Cooking</i> is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of <i>On Food and Cooking.</i> He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new <i>On Food and Cooking</i> provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment.<br /><br /><i>On Food and Cooking</i> pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, <i>On Food and Cooking</i> remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques.<br /><br />Among the major themes addressed throughout this new edition are:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Traditional and modern methods of food production and their influences on food quality<br />The great diversity of methods by which people in different places and times have prepared the same ingredients<br />Tips for selecting the best ingredients and preparing them successfully<br />The particular substances that give foods their flavors and that give us pleasure<br />Our evolving knowledge of the health benefits and risks of foods<br /><i>On Food and Cooking</i> is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food.",

    "description": "Proust dec\u00eda que todas las novelas de Dostoievski pudieron titularse Crimen y castigo. Efectivamente, la obra entera del gran escritor ruso gira alrededor de dos ideas fundamentales: la transgresi\u00f3n de las leyes morales y sociales, basada en el supuesto de la libertad humana, y el sometimiento posterior e inevitable a dichas leyes, dram\u00e1tica consecuencia de la negaci\u00f3n de esa misma libertad.<br />Sin embargo, es en la presente narraci\u00f3n donde este ciclo de osad\u00eda y arrepentimiento se expresa en su m\u00e1s perfecta forma. Crimen y castigo tiene muy pocos rivales en la novel\u00edstica mundial, y aun se ha juzgado aqu\u00ed al arte de Dostoievski como superior al de un Henry James.",

    "description": "<i>Diary of a Genius<b></b></i>stands as one of the seminal texts of Surrealism, revealing the most astonishing and intimate workings of the mind of Salvador Dal\u00ed, the eccentric polymath genius who became the living embodiment of Surrealism, the 20th century's most intensely subversive,disturbing and influential art movement.\u00a0 Dal\u00ed's second volume of autobiography, <i>Diary of\u00a0a Genius</i> covers his life from 1952 to 1963, during which years we learn of his <i>amour fou </i>for his wife Gala, and their relationship both at home in Cadaqu\u00e9s and during bizarre world travels. We also learn how Dal\u00ed draws inspiration from excrement, rotten fish and Vermeer's Lacemaker to enter his \"rhinocerontic\" period, preaching his post-holocaustal gospels of nuclear mysticism and cosmogenic atavism; and we follow the labyrinthine mental journeys that lead to the creation of such paintings as the <i>Assumption</i>, and his film script <i>The Flesh Wheelbarrow</i>.<br /><br />This new expanded edition includes a brilliant and revelatory essay on Salvador Dal\u00ed, and the importance of his art to the 20th century, by the author J. G. Ballard.",

    "description": "Napoleon dominated nearly all of Europe by 1810, largely succeeding in his aim to reign over the civilized world. But Britain eluded him. To conquer the island nation, he needed Russia's Tsar Alexander's help. The Tsar refused, and Napoleon vowed to teach him a lesson by intimidation and force. The ensuing invasion of Russia, during the frigid winter of 1812, would mark the beginning of the end of Napoleon's empire. Although his army captured Moscow after a brutal march deep into hostile territory, it was a hollow victory for the demoralized troops. Napoleon's men were eventually turned back, and their defeat was a momentous turning point in world affairs. Dramatic, insightful, and enormously absorbing, <strong>Moscow 1812</strong> is a masterful work of history.",

    "description": "<i>Yeats is Dead!</i> doesn't seem like a book so much as a protracted pub crawl in the company of 15 hyper-articulate pottymouths. Roddy Doyle, Frank McCourt, Anthony Cronin and a dozen of their lesser-known compatiots have written a literary mystery that isn't terribly literary and doesn't really hang together as a mystery. It is, however, a showcase for riffing by some very clever writers. The novel commences with a chapter from Doyle, wherein a couple of cops on the take raid the trailer of a down-and-outer. They've been instructed to do this by the all-knowing underworld crime boss Mrs Bloom (much given to crying \"O yes\" in proper Joycean fashion). Unfortunately, the two policemen accidentally kill the resident hobo and in doing so set off a whirlwind of brutality, inner-city intrigue and unlikely romance. <p> Each chapter is written by a different writer and each writer seems eager to outdo the last by killing off as many characters as possible. This can be good, bloody fun. It can also lead to some creaky exposition along the lines of this passage from Cronin's chapter: \"The guard that got shot. What did he think he was up to? And what was his connection, if any, with the Tommy Reynolds murder?\" More successful are the writers who altogether give up the ghost of creating a cohesive mystery and instead wallow around in literary references and ridiculously purple prose. Here novelist Joseph O'Connor tries his hand at an action scene: \"Gravity and Mrs Roberts had entered into conflict and, as devotees of the late Sir Isaac will confirm, out of such a negotiation may emerge one victor.\" Not exactly Tom Clancy and a good thing too.</p><p> The Irish keep turning out these collaborative efforts, the most recent being <i>Finbar's Hotel</i> and <i>Ladies Night at Finbar's Hotel</i>. (By the way, \u00a31 from the sale of this particular round-robin will go to Amnesty International.) In any case, the format can be tough on the writer who must bundle it all up in the final chapter. Here the task falls to honorary Irishman Frank McCourt and let it be said he does his salty, saucy best. <i>--Claire Dederer, Amazon.com</i></p>",

    "description": "<i>Choice</i> Outstanding Academic Title 2003<br /><br /><b>Black Garden</b> is the definitive study of how Armenia and Azerbaijan, two southern Soviet republics, got sucked into a conflict that helped bring them to independence, bringing to an end the Soviet Union, and plaguing a region of great strategic importance. It cuts between a careful reconstruction of the history of Nagorny Karabakh conflict since 1988 and on-the-spot reporting on its convoluted aftermath.<br /><br />Part contemporary history, part travel book, part political analysis, the book is based on six months traveling through the south Caucasus, more than 120 original interviews in the region, Moscow, and Washington, and unique primary sources, such as Politburo archives.<br /><br />The historical chapters trace how the conflict lay unresolved in the Soviet era; how Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders exacerbated it; how the Politiburo failed to cope with the crisis; how the war began and ended; how the international community failed to sort out the conflict.<br /><br />What emerges is a complex and subtle portrait of a beautiful and fascinating region, blighted by historical prejudice and conflict.",

    "description": "She is a Polish graduate student, finishing her doctorate in New York. He is a Brazilian anthropologist, in the city on a three-month research grant. They meet by chance in the New York Public Library, fall in love, and move into a tiny apartment together. Tereza has a lover waiting for her in Poland, Jose a wife and child in Sao Paulo. It would seem this could only be the most temporary of affairs. Yet, as Tereza recounts the extraordinary texture of their lives together, a portrait emerges of a relationship conducted at the extreme edge of sensuality - a relationship defying all conventional definitions. Jose and Tereza have no common language, they are exiled from their cultures, and for each of them the body of the other becomes everything: spirituality, sustenance, almost unbearable pleasure. In the tradition of Fatal Attraction, Slavenka Drakulic has written a breathtakingly erotic, profoundly intelligent tale of love based on pure appetite that will thrill readers with its unflinching candor, even as it shocks them with its horrifying conclusion.",

Now her looks are beyond perfect, her clothes are awesome, her boyfriend is totally hot, and she's completely popular.

    "description": "Hundreds of years before Alanna first drew her sword in Tamora Pierce's memorable debut, <i>Alanna: The First Adventure</i>, Tortall had a heroine named Beka Cooper - a fierce young woman who fights crime in a world of magic. This is the beginning of her story, her legend, and her legacy....<br /><br />Beka Cooper is a rookie with the law-enforcing Provost's Guard, commonly known as \"the Provost's Dogs,\" in Corus, the capital city of Tortall. To the surprise of both the veteran \"Dogs\" and her fellow \"puppies,\" Beka requests duty in the Lower City. The Lower City is a tough beat. But it's also where Beka was born, and she's comfortable there.<br /><br />Beka gets her wish. She's assigned to work with Mattes and Clary, famed veterans among the Provost's Dogs. They're tough, they're capable, and they're none too happy about the indignity of being saddled with a puppy for the first time in years. What they don't know is that Beka has something unique to offer. Never much of a talker, Beka is a good listener. So good, in fact, that she hears things that Mattes and Clary never could - information that is passed in murmurs when flocks of pigeons gather ... murmurs that are the words of the dead.<br /><br />In this way, Beka learns of someone in the Lower City who has overturned the power structure of the underworld and is terrorizing its citizens into submission and silence. Beka's magical listening talent is the only way for the Provost's Dogs to find out the identity of this brutal new underlord, for the dead are beyond fear. And the ranks of the dead will be growing if the Dogs can't stop a crime wave the likes of which has never been seen. Luckily for the people of the Lower City, the new puppy is a true terrier!",

As Keating turns the boys on to the great words of Byron, Shelley, and Keats, they discover not only the beauty of language, but the importance of making each moment count.But the Dead Poets pledges soon realize that their newfound freedom can have tragic consequences. Can the club and the individuality it inspires survive the pressure from authorities determined to destroy their dreams?",

    "description": "In this stunning memoir, Rob Sheffield, a veteran rock and pop culture critic and staff writer for Rolling Stone magazine, tells the story of his musical coming of age, and how rock music, the first love of his life, led him to his second, a girl named Renee. Rob and Renee's life together - they wed after graduate school, both became music journalists, and were married only five years when Renee died suddenly on Mother's Day, 1997 - is shared through the window of the mix tapes they obsessively compiled. There are mixes to court each other, mixes for road trips, mixes for doing the dishes, mixes for sleeping - and, eventually, mixes to mourn Rob's greatest loss. The tunes were among the great musical output of the early 1990s - Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Pavement, Yo La Tengo, REM, Weezer - as well as classics by The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Aretha Franklin and more. Mixing the skilful, tragic punch of Dave Eggers and the romantic honesty of Nick Hornby, LOVE IS A MIX TAPE is a story of lost love and the kick-you-in-the-gut energy of great pop music.",

    "description": "On a stormy November night in 1848, a ship carrying more than a hundred Irish emigrants ran aground twenty miles off the coast of Maine. Many were saved, but some were not -- including a young girl who died crying out the name of her brother.<br /><br />In the present day, the artist Oisin MacDara lives in self-imposed exile on Tiranogue -- the small island where the shipwrecked Irish settled. The past is Oisin's curse, as memories of the twin sister who died tragically when he was a boy haunt him still.<br /><br />Then on a quiet All Hallows' Eve, a restless spirit is beckoned into his home by a candle flickering in the window: the ghost of the girl whose brief life ended on Tiranogue's shore more than a century earlier. In Oisin's house she seeks comfort and warmth, and a chance at the life that was denied her so long ago.<br /><br />For a lonely man chained by painful memories, nothing will ever be the same again.",

In <i>Incidental Findings, </i> she's finished her training and is learning through practice to become a more rounded healer. The book opens with a dramatic tale of the tables being turned on Dr. Ofri: She's had to shed the precious white coat and credentials she worked so hard to earn and enter her own hospital as a patient. She experiences the real'slight prick and pressure' of a long needle as well as the very real sense of invasion and panic that routinely visits her patients.<br /><br />These fifteen intertwined tales include 'Living Will, ' where Dr. Ofri treats a man who has lost the will to live, and she too comes dangerously close to concluding that he has nothing to live for;'Common Ground, ' in which a patient's difficult decision to have an abortion highlights the vulnerabilities of doctor and patient alike;'Acne, ' where she is confronted by a patient whose physical and emotional abuse she can't possibly heal, so she must settle on treating the one thing she can, the least of her patient's problems; and finally a stunning concluding chapter, 'Tools of the Trade, ' where Dr. Ofri's touch is the last in a woman's long life.",

Anne Kingston looks at \"wife backlash,\" and the new wave of neo-traditionalism that urges women to marry young; explores the apotheosis of abused wives and the strange celebration of wives who kill; and muses on the fact that Oprah Winfrey and Martha Stewart, two of the world's wealthiest and most influential women, are both unmarried. The result is an entertaining mix of social, sexual, historical, and economic commentary that is bound to stir debate even as it reframes our view of both women and marriage.",

Only it\u2019s not like the movies or old man Stoker\u2019s storybook. It\u2019s worse. Especially if you happen to be one of them<i>. </i>Just<i> </i>ask Joe Pitt.<i>\n  <br /></i><br />There\u2019s a shambler on the loose. Some fool who got himself infected with a flesh-eating bacteria is lurching around, trying to munch on folks\u2019 brains. Joe hates shamblers, but he\u2019s still the one who has to deal with them. That\u2019s just the kind of life he has. Except afterlife might be better word.<br /><br />From the Battery to the Bronx, and from river to river, Manhattan is crawling with Vampyres. Joe is one of them, and he\u2019s not happy about it. Yeah, he gets to be stronger and faster than you, and he\u2019s tough as nails and hard to kill. But spending his nights trying to score a pint of blood to feed the Vyrus that\u2019s eating at him isn\u2019t his idea of a good time. And Joe doesn\u2019t make it any easier on himself. Going his own way, refusing to ally with the Clans that run the undead underside of Manhattan\u2013it ain\u2019t easy. It\u2019s worse once he gets mixed up with the Coalition\u2013the city\u2019s most powerful Clan\u2013and finds himself searching for a poor little rich girl who\u2019s gone missing in Alphabet City.<br /><br />Now the Coalition and the girl\u2019s high-society parents are breathing down his neck, anarchist Vampyres are pushing him around, and a crazy Vampyre cult is stalking him. No time to complain, though. Got to find that girl and kill that shambler before the whip comes down . . . and before the sun comes up.",

    "description": "Carmen Bryan is no stranger to the rap world. Not only did she work at Def Jam and Capitol Records but she shares a daughter with hip-hop superstar Nas -- a relationship made extremely public through Nas's celebrity status, rap lyrics, and the ever-present media. Now, in It's No Secret, a strong, resilient Carmen bares all, telling her side of the story and leaving no detail unturned -- with the true candor and raw emotion of someone who has been there, done that, and survived. From a clandestine relationship with Nas's biggest rival, Jay-Z, that stirred up the biggest feud in hip-hop history, to seeing her reputation in tatters and a once loving relationship with Nas fall apart, Carmen depicts her trying journey to become the strong woman and mother she is today. After years of turmoil that included drugs, sex, greed, and violence -- and abandoning what she had always prized above all, her freedom -- Carmen took a stand, focusing on herself. After years of pursuit by the media, Carmen sets the record straight in It's No Secret -- and has no regrets.",

In Seattle, Kurt Cobain reeks of teen spirit. In Washington, George Bush (the first one) has just finished rattling his saber at Saddam Hussein. And in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Vim is trying to put off adulthood and all that comes with it, whatever that is, for as long as he can. He's already juggling guitars, girls, and a long-absent biological father who's suddenly making noise about Wanting to Be Involved. And he still can't convince his friends why local schoolboy hero Derek Jeter is bound for obscurity. </p> <p> <i>Grab On to Me Tightly as if I Knew the Way</i> traces Vim's stumble toward adulthood as he comes to terms with his parents, balances friendships and infatuation with varying levels of success, and accepts that the things he thought would last forever probably won't. Generous in spirit and laugh-out-loud funny, here is a novel that introduces a tremendous new talent and deftly captures the alternately amusing and harrowing process of holding on until you find your way.</p>",

    "description": "It's the end of the world as we know it...<br />Someday soon, you might wake up to the call to prayer from a muezzin. Europeans already are. And liberals will still tell you that \"diversity is our strength\"--while Talibanic enforcers cruise Greenwich Village burning books and barber shops, the Supreme Court decides sharia law doesn't violate the \"separation of church and state,\" and the Hollywood Left decides to give up on gay rights in favor of the much safer charms of polygamy. If you think this can't happen, you haven't been paying attention, as the hilarious, provocative, and brilliant Mark Steyn--the most popular conservative columnist in the English-speaking world--shows to devastating effect. The future, as Steyn shows, belongs to the fecund and the confident. And the Islamists are both, while the West is looking ever more like the ruins of a civilization. But America can survive, prosper, and defend its freedom only if it continues to believe in itself, in the sturdier virtues of self-reliance (not government), in the centrality of family, and in the conviction that our country really is the world's last best hope. Mark Steyn's America Alone is laugh-out-loud funny--but it will also change the way you look at the world.<br />",

A legend as old as the stars rules this constructed world; When the seventh seventh seventh human Heptarch is crowned, he will be the Kristos and will bring eternal salvation . . . or the destruction of the cosmos.<br /><br />Patience is the only daughter of the rightful Heptarch, but she, like her father before her, serves the usurper who has destroyed her family. For she has learned the true ruler's honor.<br /><br />Duty to one's race is more important than duty to one's self. But the time for prudence has passed, and that which has slept for ages has awakened. And Patience must journey to the heartsoul of this planet to confront her destiny . . . and her world's.",

Then one day a good-looking marriageable kinsman named Jacob showed up, looking for a haven from his brother's rage, and Leah fell in love at once. It didn't surprise her at all that Jacob saw only Rachel. But surely, as the two sisters worked and lived alongside Jacob for seven years, he would come to realize that Leah was the one he ought to marry...",

    "description": "A Pulitzer Prize-winner offers a book about femaleness --- in body and mind --- that could prove as important as The Second Sex or Our Bodies, Our Selves and as fresh as Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom. With the clarity, insight, and sheer joy of language that has secured her reputation as one of the New York Times's premier stylists, Natalie Angier lifts the veil of secrecy from that most enigmatic of evolutionary masterpieces, the female body, exploring the essence of what it means to be a woman. Angier's thoughts on everything from organs to orgasm evince her famously playful originality, yet stand their ground in scientific fact. She also dives into hot topics such as menopause and evolutionary psychologists' faddish views of \"female nature,\" creating a sparkling, fresh vision of womanhood.",

    "description": "WELCOME TO FOO.<br /><br />Fourteen-year-old Leven Thumps (a.k.a. \"Lev\") lives a wretched life in Burnt Culvert, Oklahoma. But his life is about to change and his destiny be fulfilled as he learns about a secret gateway that bridges two worlds -- the real world and Foo, a place created at the beginning of time in the folds of the mind that makes it possible for mankind to dream and hope, aspire and imagine. But Foo is in chaos, and three transplants from that dreamworld have been sent to retrieve Lev, who alone has the power to save Foo.<p>Enter Clover, a wisecracking, foot-high sidekick; Winter, a girl with a special power of her own; and Geth, the rightful heir to Foo. Their mission: to convince Lev that he has the power to save Foo. Can this unique band of travelers help Lev overcome his doubt? Will Lev find the gateway in time? Or will Sabine and his dark shadows find the gateway first and destroy mankind?</p>",

With incomparable glee, Miller shifts effortlessly from Virgil to venereal disease, from Rabelais to Roquefort. In this seductive technicolor swirl of Paris and New York, he captures like no one else the blending of people and the cities they inhabit.",

    "description": "Whilst living amongst Peruvian Indians, anthropologist Jeremy Narby learned of their phenomenal knowledge of plants and biochemical interactions, gained under the influence of the hallucinogen ayahuasca. Despite his initial scepticism, Narby found himself engaged in an increasingly obsessive quest. He researched cutting-edge scholarship in subjects as diverse as molecular biology, shamanism, neurology and mytholohu, which led him inexorably to the conclusion that the Indians' claims were literally true: to a consciousness prepared with drugs, biochemical knowledge could indeed be transmitted, through DNA itself.",

The methodology of the late Paulo Freire has helped to empower countless impoverished and illiterate people throughout the world. Freire's work has taken on especial urgency in the United States and Western Europe, where the creation of a permanent underclass among the underprivileged and minorities in cities and urban centers is increasingly accepted as the norm. With a substantive new introduction on Freire's life and the remarkable impact of this book by writer and Freire confidant and authority Donaldo Macedo, this anniversary edition of <i>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</i> will inspire a new generation of educators, students, and general readers for years to come.",

Mixing memoir with mendacity, Slater examines memories of her youth, when after being diagnosed with a strange illness she developed seizures and neurological disturbances-and the compulsion to lie. Openly questioning the reliability of memoir itself, Slater presents the mesmerizing story of a young woman who discovers not only what plagues her but also what cures her-the birth of her sensuality, her creativity as an artist, and storytelling as an act of healing.",

    "description": "In <i>Wizard's First Rule,</i> Richard Cypher's world was turned upside down. Once a simple woods guide, Richard was forced to become the Seeker of Truth, to save the world from the vile dominance of Darken Rahl, the most viciously savage and powerful wizard the world had ever seen. He was joined on this epic quest by his beloved Kahlan, the only survivor among the Confessors, who brought a powerful but benevolent justice to the land before Rahl's evil scourge. Aided by Zedd, the last of the wizards who opposed Rahl, they were able to cast him into the underworld, saving the world from the living hell of life under Rahl.<br /><br />But the veil to the underworld has been torn, and Rahl, from beyond the veil, begins to summon a sinister power more dreadful than any he has wielded before. Horrifying creatures escape through the torn veil, wreaking havoc on the unsuspecting world above.<br /><br />If Rahl isn't stopped, he will free the Keeper itself, an evil entity whose power is so vast and foul that once freed, it can never again be contained.<br /><br />Richard and Kahlan must face Rahl and the Keeper's terrible minions. But first, Richard must endure the ministrations of the Sisters of the Light, or die from the pain of magic that is his birthright and his curse. While Richard undertakes the arduous journey to the forbidden city of the Sisters, Kahlan must embark upon a long and dangerous mission to Aydindril, citadel of the old wizards, where she hopes to find Zedd and the help only he can lend to their desperate cause.<br /><br />War, suffering, torture, and deceit lie in their paths, and nothing will save them from a destiny of violent death, unless their courage and faith are joined with luck and they find the elusive...<i>Stone of Tears</i>.",

Richard\u2019s world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence.\n    \n    In a dark age, it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion. Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge\u2014or become the next victims.\n    \n    Except as noted below, each novel was written to stand alone, they follow a common timeline and are linked by ongoing events that occur throughout the series. It is recommended that they be read in order.\n    \n    Books 9-11 & 12-14 are intended to be trilogies within the larger series.\n    \n    http://us.macmillan.com/series/SwordofTruth\n    \n    Series also known as:\n    <i>* La spada della verit\u00e0 [Italian]\n    * La espada de la verdad [Spanish]</i>",

    "description": "Bill Bryson's first travel book, <i>The Lost Continent</i>, was unanimously acclaimed as one of the funniest books in years. In <i>Neither Here nor There</i> he brings his unique brand of humour to bear on Europe as he shoulders his backpack, keeps a tight hold on his wallet, and journeys from Hammerfest, the northernmost town on the continent, to Istanbul on the cusp of Asia. Fluent in, oh, at least one language, he retraces his travels as a student twenty years before.<br /><br />Whether braving the homicidal motorist of Paris, being robbed by gypsies in Florence, attempting not to order tripe and eyeballs in a German restaurant, window-shopping in the sex shops of the Reeperbahn or disputing his hotel bill in Copenhagen, Bryson takes in the sights, dissects the culture and illuminates each place and person with his hilariously caustic observations. He even goes to Liechtenstein.",

    "description": "Earning a Pulitzer and three Best Play awards for 1994, Edward Albee has, in <b>Three Tall Women</b>, created a masterwork of modern theater. As an imperious, acerbic old woman lies dying, she is tended by two other women and visited by a young man. Albee's frank dialogue about everything from incontinence to infidelity portrays aging without sentimentality. His scenes are charged with wit, pain, and laughter, and his observations tell us about forgiveness, reconciliation, and our own fates. But it is his probing portrait of the three women that reveals Albee's genius. Separate characters on stage in the first act, yet actually the same \"everywoman\" at different ages in the second act, these \"tall women\" lay bare the truths of our lives\u2014how we live, how we love, what we settle for, and how we die. Edward Albee has given theatergoers, critics, and students of drama reason to rejoice.",

He can read jurors' expressions, feel their emotions, know their thoughts. With this remarkable ability, Sloane gets juries to believe the unbelievable, excuse the inexcusable, and return the most astonishing verdicts. <br /><br />The only barrier to Sloane's professional success is his conscience -- until he gets a call from a man later found dead, and his life rockets out of control.",

    "description": "Three Nights in August captures the strategic and emotional complexities of baseball's quintessential form, the three-game series. As the St. Louis Cardinals battle their archrival Chicago Cubs, we watch from the dugout through the eyes of legendary manager Tony La Russa, considered by many to be the shrewdest mind in the game today. In his twenty-seven years of managing, La Russa has been named Manager of the Year a record-making five times and now stands as the third-winningest baseball manager of all time. A great leader, he's built his success on the conviction that ball games are won not only by the numbers but also by the hearts and minds of those who play.<br /><br />Drawing on unprecedented access to a major league manager and his team, Buzz Bissinger brings a revelatory intimacy to baseball and offers some surprising observations. Bissinger also furthers the debate on major league managerial style and strategy in his provocative new afterword.",

    "description": "Gerard de Nerval (1808-1855), a contemporary of Poe, De Quincey, Gogol, and Heine, introduced into French literature a mode of writing rooted in German romanticism yet already recognizably modernist in its explorations of the uncertain borderlines between dream and reality, irony and madness, autobiography and fiction.. \"This selection of writings - the first such comprehensive gathering to appear in English - provides an overview of Nerval's work as a poet, belletrist, short-story writer and autobiographer. In addition to 'Aurelia', the memoir of his madness, 'Sylvie' (considered a 'masterpiece' by Proust), and the hermetic sonnets of 'The Chimeras', this volume includes Nerval's Doppelganger tales and experimental fictions. Selections from his correspondence demonstrate a lucid awareness of the strategies by which nineteenth-century psychiatry consigned his visionary imagination to the purgatory of mental illness.",

From a harrowingly cheerless childhood in Germany through acne-riddled high school years and his adolescent discoveries of alcohol, women, and the Los Angeles Public Library's collection of D. H. Lawrence, \"Ham on Rye\" offers a crude, brutal, and savagely funny portrait of an outcast's coming-of-age during the desperate days of the Great Depression.",

    "description": "Gene Wilder was one of the great comic actors who defined the 1970's and 1980's in movies. From his early work with Woody Allen to the rich group of movies he made with Mel Brooks to his partnership on screen with Richard Pryor, Wilder's performances are still discussed and celebrated today. <i>Kiss Me Like A Strange</i>r is an intimate glimpse of the man behind the image on the screen.<br /><br />In this book, Wilder talks about everything from his experiences in psychoanalysis to why he got into acting (and later comedy-his first goal was to be a Shakespearean actor) to how a Midwestern childhood with a sick mother changed him. He writes about the creative process on stage and on screen, and divulges moments from life on the sets of the some of the most iconic movies of our time. He also opens up about his love affairs and marriages, including his marriage to comedian Gilda Radner. But the core of <i>Kiss Me Like A Stranger</i> is an actor's search for truth and a thoughtful analysis of why the choices he made-some of them so serendipitous they were practically accidental-changed the course of his life.",

And with them went Garion, a simple farm boy only months before, but now the focus of the struggle. He had never believed in sorcery and wanted no part of it. Yet with every league they traveled, the power grew in him, forcing him to acts of wizardry he could not accept.<br /><br />\"BELGARIAD is exactly the kind of fantasy I like. It has magic, adventure, humor, mystery, and a certain delightful human insight.\"<br />=PIERS ANTHONY=",

But our friends back home live an existence under the weight and awareness of times; a place we are slowly escaping; a world growing fainter by the hour and the mile.\"<br /><br />Day 13: \"It feels again that we are leaving who we were, moving on into the people we will become, hopefully, people with some kind of answers, some kind of thing to believe tht makes sense of beauty, of romance. Something that would explain the red glow against Paul's face, the red glow that seems to be coming off the console . . . 'Did you notice the engine light is lit, bud?' I ask . . .\"<br /><br />Day 83: \"I sit in the van, waiting for her to come out when I notice a window in one of the classrooms open, and a backpack comes falling out, spilling a few books onto the lawn. After the backpack comes Elida, falling atop the pack and laying low, peeking back into the window to see if the teacher noticed. She gathers her books, reaches into the classroom and closes the window, then runs toward the van as though this were a prison break.\"<br /><br />As you read <em>Through Painted Deserts, </em>you'll soon realize this is not just one man's account of finding light, God, and beauty on the open road. Rather, this book maps the journey you're already traveling\u00a0. . . or soon will be.",

Then one day, into her coffee-making, dictation-taking world walks Sandy Spires, a beautiful, commanding\u2014and blind\u2014lawyer who joins the firm and inspires Winona to renew work on her long-languishing film. Meanwhile, Winona\u2019s love life is a mess: Her relationship with Jeremy the Sincere is doomed, her other dates are always disasters, and she stubbornly ignores the attentions of her engaging colleague, Rex. Just as Winona hits bottom romantically and also realizes Sandy is not who she\u2019s pretending to be, she comes to understand that she might need to take a more honest look at herself.<br /><br />The Great American Secretary\u2019s novel meets The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman, this charming, inspiring and wonderfully written portrait of the dynamics of office life speaks to every woman who has felt caught between duty and her heart\u2019s desire.",

Only because our elections have become so dependent on television and its emphatic emptiness, says Miller, could a man of such sublime and complacent ignorance assume the highest office in the land.",

    "description": "Twenty-seven-year old Anne Elliot is Austen's most adult heroine. Eight years before the story proper begins, she is happily betrothed to a naval officer, Frederick Wentworth, but she precipitously breaks off the engagement when persuaded by her friend Lady Russell that such a match is unworthy. The breakup produces in Anne a deep and long-lasting regret. When later Wentworth returns from sea a rich and successful captain, he finds Anne's family on the brink of financial ruin and his own sister a tenant in Kellynch Hall, the Elliot estate. All the tension of the novel revolves around one question: Will Anne and Wentworth be reunited in their love?<br /><br />Jane Austen once compared her writing to painting on a little bit of ivory, 2 inches square. Readers of <i>Persuasion</i> will discover that neither her skill for delicate, ironic observations on social custom, love, and marriage nor her ability to apply a sharp focus lens to English manners and morals has deserted her in her final finished work.",

    "description": "<b>The classic first cookbook from the coauthor of <i>Veganomicon</i> is back with even more tasty recipes, chatty anecdotes, and money-saving tips for easy plant-based cooking, featuring tempting full-color photos throughout.</b><br /><br />Ten years ago a young Brooklyn chef was making a name for herself by dishing up amazing vegan meals--no fuss, no b.s., just easy, cheap, delicious food. Several books--including <i>Veganomicon</i>, <i>Appetite for Reduction</i>, <i>Isa Does It</i>, and <i>Superfun Times Holiday Cookbook</i>--later, the punk rock priestess of all things tasty and animal-free returns to her roots-and we're not just talking tubers. The book that started it all is back, with new recipes, ways to make those awesome favorites even awesomer, more in-the-kitchen tips with Fizzle--and full-color photos of those amazing dishes throughout.<br />With tips for taming your tofu, doing away with dairy, and getting rid of the eggs, you'll find recipes for: <br /><br />\"Fronch\" Toast; Biscuits and White Bean Sausage Gravy; Chile sin Carne al Mole; Apple Pie-Crumb Cake Muffins; Three Kinds of Knishes (Knish Madness!); Revolutionary Spanish Omelet; Tempeh Reuben; Braised Cauliflower with Three-Seed Sauce; Ethiopian Seitan and Peppers; No-Bake Black Bottom-Peanut Butter Silk Pie; Coconut Heaven Cupcakes...and more. So much more. <br />",

Stuck in a loveless relationship with her boyfriend, Mark, Julia thinks a baby is the answer . . . but she may want a baby more than she wants her boyfriend. Will a trip to New York City with a jet-setting friend\u2014and all the glittering energy and eligible men the city brings\u2014help her discover what she really needs? <br /><br />Maeve, on the other hand, is allergic to commitment. A feisty, red-haired, high-power career girl, she cherishes her ability to do just as she pleases and breaks out in a rash every time she passes a stroller. But when her no-strings-attached nightlife leads to an unexpected pregnancy, her reaction may be just as unexpected.And then there\u2019s Samantha\u2014happily married and eager to be the perfect June Cleaveresque mother. But baby George brings only exhaustion, extra pounds, and marital strife to her once tidy life. Is having an affair with a friend\u2019s incredibly sexy husband the answer?",

    "description": "<b>A reissue of the book that first examined the future of reading and literature in the electronic age, now with a new introduction and Afterword</b><br /><br />In our zeal to embrace the wonders of the electronic age, are we sacrificing our literary culture? Renowned critic Sven Birkerts believes the answer is an alarming yes. In <i>The Gutenberg Elegies</i>, he explores the impact of technology on the experience of reading. Drawing on his own passionate, lifelong love of books, Birkerts examines how literature intimately shapes and nourishes the inner life. What does it mean to \"hear\" a book on audiotape or decipher its words in electronic form on a laptop screen? Can the world created by Henry James exist in an era defined by the work of Bill Gates? Are books as we know them\u2014volumes printed in ink on paper, with pages to be turned as the reading of each page is completed\u2014dead?<br /><br />At once a celebration of the complex pleasures of reading and a bold challenge to the information technologies of today and tomorrow, <i>The Gutenberg Elegies</i> is an essential volume for anyone who cares about the past and the future of books.",

    "description": "The villagers of Withens are dying. Emma Renshaw vanished two years ago, her body never found. Now her former housemate has been bludgeoned, his remains discovered near a deserted railway tunnel. Is there a link between the two? <br /><br />While Detective Sergeant Diane Fry focuses on Emma\u2019s possible murder, her colleague Ben Cooper investigates a series of burglaries. Only one family seems exempt: the Oxleys. Descended from workmen who built the ancient tunnels beneath the village, they stick close to their own\u2013and keep their secrets closer. Caught in the tangle of death and deception are Cooper and Fry. Their personal history and professional relationship have blurred before, and will again, as their cases converge in the most unsettling ways. . . .",

    "description": "Esther Gottesfeld is the last living survivor of the notorious 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist fire and has told her story countless times in the span of her lifetime. Even so, her death at the age of 106 leaves unanswered many questions about what happened that fateful day. How did she manage to survive the fire when at least 146 workers, most of them women, her sister and fiance among them, burned or jumped to their deaths from the sweatshop inferno? Are the discrepancies in her various accounts over the years just ordinary human fallacy, or is there a hidden story in Esther's recollections of that terrible day? Esther's granddaughter Rebecca Gottesfeld, with her partner George Botkin, an ingenious composer, seek to unravel the facts of the matter while Ruth Zion, a zealous feminist historian of the fire, bores in on them with her own mole-like agenda. A brilliant, haunting novel about one of the most terrible tragedies in early-twentieth-century America, \"Triangle \"forces us to consider how we tell our stories, how we hear them, and how history is forged from unverifiable truths.",

    "description": "In 1996, when Howard Lyman warned America on <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i> that Mad Cow Disease was coming to America, offended cattlemen sued him and Oprah both. Not only were Lyman and Oprah vindicated in court, but events have proved many of Lyman's predictions absolutely right. Mad Cow Disease has come to America, and Lyman argues persuasively in <i>No More Bull!</i> that the problem will only grow more deadly until our government deals with it seriously. <p> In <i>Mad Cowboy</i>, Lyman, a fourth-generation Montana rancher turned vegetarian then vegan, told the story of his personal transformation after a spinal tumor, which he believes was caused by agricultural chemicals, nearly left him paralyzed. In <i>No More Bull!</i>, Lyman uses his humor, compassion, firsthand experience in agriculture, and command of the facts of health to argue that we might all profit by transforming our diets. He makes a powerful case that Alzheimer's is yet another disease linked to eating meat. And he explains that the steak at the heart of your dinner plate not only may destroy your own heart but actually offers no more nutritional value than a doughnut! If you've been confused by the competing claims of the Atkins Diet, the South Beach Diet, and other fad diets, <i>No More Bull!</i> is the book that will set you straight. Its pure, unvarnished truth is told with down-home common sense. </p><p> Lyman's got a message for meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans -- and the message of <i>No More Bull!</i> is that we can all do better for ourselves and the planet.</p>",

    "description": "The acclaimed naval historian Roger Knight has written a magisterial biography of one of the greatest military heroes of world history. How did Horatio Nelson achieve such extraordinary success? Roger Knight places him firmly in the context of the Royal Navy of his time. Nelson was passionate and relentless from the outset of his career; his leadership in battle was unrivalled. But his success depended also on the strength of intelligence available to him, the quality of the ships he commanded, the potency of his guns, and the skill of his seamen.<br /><br />Based on a vast array of new sources, this biography demolishes many of the myths that have surrounded Nelson for two centuries. Knight demonstrates that this great Romantic hero was in his time a shrews political operator and often a difficult subordinate. He was occasionally na\u00efve, often impatient, and only happy when completely in command. While capable of great acts of generosity, he could be deeply ruthless--both aboard ship and in his personal life.<br /><br />Destined to be the definitive account of Horatio Nelson's life for generations, this dazzling biography greatly enriches our understanding of this extraordinary man--brilliant, severely flawed, and never to be crossed.",

He saves her from drowning, but despite his efforts she slips into a coma. What follows astonishes everyone: Within days of the accident, mysterious events begin to occur around Annika. Monroe's family members react to these apparent miracles in very different ways -- Mom finds God, Dad finds the bottle, and older brother Ben finds new ways to torture Monroe. In the end, Monroe must decide what's worth believing in, what's worth fighting for, and, finally, who he wants to be.",

A national figure, Diana inspired passion and ignited tempers, but never more so than the day of her death. Her husband Frank, a longtime attorney in the DA\u2019s office; her daughter Megan, a freshman in college; the Reverend Stephen O\u2019Connell, founder of the town\u2019s pro-life coalition: all of them quarreled with Diana that day and each one has something to lose in revealing the truth. Meanwhile the detective on the case struggles for the answers \u2014 and finds himself more intimately involved than he ever could have imagined.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",

Imperialism has never been more fun.<br />To unravel the mysteries of war, O'Rourke first visits Kosovo: \"Wherever there's injustice, oppression, and suffering, America will show up six months later and bomb the country next to where it's happening.\" He travels to Israel at the outbreak of the intifada. He flies to Egypt in the wake of the 9/11 terrorists' attacks and contemplates bygone lunacies. \"Why are the people in the Middle East so crazy? Here, at the pyramids, was an answer from the earliest days of civilization: People have always been crazy.\" He covers the demonstrations and the denunciations of war. \"A moral compass needle needs a butt end. Wherever direction France is pointing-toward collaboration with Nazis, accommodation with communists, existentialism, Jerry Lewis, or a UN resolution veto-we can go the other way with a quiet conscience.\" Finally he arrives in Baghdad with the U.S. Army and, standing in one of Saddam's palaces, decides, \"If a reason for invading Iraq was needed, felony interior decorating would have sufficed.\"",

Now Orenstein uses the same interviewing and reporting skills to examine the lives of women in their 20s, 30s and 40s. <br /><br />The advances of the women's movement allow women to grow up with a sense of expanded possibilities. Yet traditional expectations have hardly changed. To discover how they are navigating this double burden personally and professionally, Orenstein interviewed hundreds of women and has blended their voices into a compelling narrative that gets deep inside their lives and choices. With unusual sensitivity, Orenstein offers insight and inspiration for every woman who is making important decisions of her own.",

The army fought off Confederate forces, demolished cities, and accumulated a borne-along population of freed blacks and white refugees until all that remained was the dangerous transient life of the dispossessed and the triumphant. In E. L. Doctorow\u2019s hands the great march becomes a floating world, a nomadic consciousness, and an unforgettable reading experience with awesome relevance to our own times.",

Toxic\u2013in laws come in a wide variety of guises: \"The Critics\", who tell you what you're doing wrong; \"The Controllers\", who try to run you and your partner's life; \"The Engulfers\", who make incessant demands on your time; \"The Masters of Chaos\", who drain you and your partner with their problems; and \"The Rejecters\", who let you know they don't want you as part of their family.<br /><br />Susan Forward draws on real\u2013life voices and stories of both women and men struggling to free themselves from the frustrating, hurtful and infuriating relationships with their toxic in\u2013laws. Dr. Forward offers you highly effective communication and behavioral techniques for getting through to partners who won't or can't stand up to their parents. Next, she lays out accessible and practical ways to reclaim you marriage from your in\u2013laws. She shows you what to say, what to do and what limits to set. If you follow these strategies, you may not turn toxic in\u2013laws into the in\u2013laws of your dreams, but you will find some peace in your relationship with them.",
