The volatility of these alien overlords is something with which Tess Soerensen is all too familiar. Her brother, Charles, rebelled against them at one time and was rewarded by being elevated into their interstellar system\u2014yet there is reason to believe they murdered his and Tess\u2019s parents.<br /><br />Struggling to find her place in the world and still mending a broken heart, Tess sneaks aboard a shuttle bound for Rhui, one of her brother\u2019s planets. On the ground, she joins up with the native jaran people, becoming immersed in their nomadic society and customs while also attempting to get to the bottom of a smuggling scheme she encountered on her journey there. As she grows ever closer to the charismatic jaran ruler, Ilya\u2014who is inflamed by an urgent mission of his own\u2014Tess must choose between her feelings for him and her loyalty to her brother.<br /><br /><i>Jaran</i> is the first volume of the Novels of the Jaran, which continues with <i>An Earthly Crown</i>, <i>His Conquering Sword</i>, and <i>The Law of Becoming</i>.",

    "description": "With this stunning novel about a woman and a marriage that begins in passion and becomes violent, the Pulitzer Prize--winning journalist and bestselling author of \"One True Thing\" and \"Object Lessons\" moves to a new dimension as a writer of superb fiction. \"If literature were judged solely by its ability to elicit strong emotions, \" Kirkus Reviews said about \"One True Thing,\" \"columnist-cum-novelist Quindlen would win another Pulitzer.\" And the same will be said about \"Black and Blue,\" a brilliant novel of suspense, substance, and importance.In \"Black and Blue,\" Fran Benedetto tells a spellbinding story: how at 19 she fell in love with Bobby Benedetto, how their passionate marriage became a nightmare, why she stayed, and what happened on the night she finally decided to run away with her 10-year-old son and start a new life under a new name. Living in fear in Florida--yet with increasing confidence, freedom, and hope--Fran unravels the complex threads of family, identity, and desire that shape a woman's life, even as she begins to create a new one. As Fran starts to heal from the pain of the past, she almost believes she has escaped it--that Bobby Benedetto will not find her and again provoke the complex combustion between them of attraction and destruction, lust and love. \"Black and Blue\" is a beautifully written, heart-stopping story in which Anna Quindlen writes with power, wisdom, and humor about the real lives of men and women, the varieties of people and love, the bonds between mother and child, the solace of family and friendship, the inexplicable feelings between people who are passionately connected in ways they don't understand.",

    "description": "Explosive in both its pace and its revelations, The Third Secret is a remarkable international thriller. Bestselling author Steve Berry tackles some of the most controversial ideas of our time in a breakneck journey through the history of the Church and the future of religion. <br /><br />Fatima, Portugal, 1917: The Virgin Mary appears to three peasant children, sharing with them three secrets, two of which are soon revealed to the world. The third secret is sealed away in the Vatican, read only by popes, and not disclosed until the year 2000. When revealed, its quizzical tone and anticlimactic nature leave many faithful wondering if the Church has truly unveiled all of the Virgin Mary's words\u2013or if a message far more important has been left in the shadows. <br /><br />Vatican City, present day: Papal secretary Father Colin Michener is concerned for the Pope. Night after restless night, Pope Clement XV enters the Vatican's Riserva, the special archive open only to popes, where the Church's most clandestine and controversial documents are stored. Though unsure of the details, Michener knows that the Pope's distress stems from the revelations of Fatima. <br /><br />Equally concerned, but not out of any sense of compassion, is Alberto Cardinal Valendrea, the Vatican's Secretary of State,. Valendrea desperately covets the papacy, having narrowly lost out to Clement at the last conclave. Now the Pope's interest in Fatima threatens to uncover a shocking ancient truth that Valendrea has kept to himself for many years. <br /><br />When Pope Clement sends Michener to the Romanian highlands, then to a Bosnian holy site, in search of a priest\u2013possibly one of the last people on Earth who knows Mary's true message\u2013a perilous set of events unfolds. Michener finds himself embroiled in murder, suspicion, suicide, deceit, and his forbidden passion for a beloved woman. In a desperate search for answers, he travels to Pope Clement's birthplace in Germany, where he learns that the third secret of Fatima may dictate the very fate of the Church\u2013a fate now lying in Michener's own hands.",

Now, firmly established as the owner of an enormously successful gin distillery she inherited from her father, she can begin to realize her dream.<br /><br />Set in eighteenth-century Brooklyn, this is the beautifully written story of a woman with a vision: a gargantuan construction of timber and masonry to span the East River. With the help of her sisters--high-spirited Tem and silent, uncanny Pearl--Prue fires the imaginations of the people of Brooklyn and New York by promising them easy passage between their two worlds.<br /><br /><i>Brookland</i> confirms Emily Barton's reputation as one of the finest writers of her generation, whose work is \"blessedly post-ironic, engaging and heartfelt\" (Thomas Pynchon).",

    "description": "<b>The stunning, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling follow-up to <i>The Notebook</i>--a story of an ordinary man who goes to extraordinary lengths to win back the love of his life.</b><br /><b>\n  <br /></b>After thirty years, Wilson Lewis is forced to face a painful truth: the romance has gone out of his marriage. His wife, Jane, has fallen out of love with him, and it is entirely his fault. Despite the shining example of his in-laws, Noah and Allie Calhoun, and their fifty-year love affair, Wilson himself is a man unable to express his true feelings. He has spent too little time at home and too much at the office, leaving the responsibility of raising their children to Jane. Now his daughter is about to marry, and his wife is thinking about leaving him. But if Wilson is sure of anything, it is this: His love for Jane has only grown over the years, and he will do everything he can to save their marriage. With the memories of Noah and Allie's inspiring life together as his guide, he vows to find a way to make his wife fall in love with him...all over again. <br /><br />In this powerfully moving tale of love lost, rediscovered, and renewed, Nicholas Sparks once again brings readers his unique insight into the only emotion that ultimately really matters.<br />",

    "description": "Long before U.S. News and World Report named him one of America's Best Leaders and Oprah Winfrey called him \"an angel from God,\" Geoffrey Canada was a small, vulnerable, scared boy growing up in the South Bronx. Canada's world was one where \"sidewalk\" boys learned the codes of the block and were ranked through the rituals of fist, stick, and knife. Then the streets changed, and the stakes got even higher. In this candid and riveting memoir, Canada relives a childhood in which violence stalked every street corner. \"If you wonder how a fourteen-year-old can shoot another child his own age in the head and then go home to dinner,\" Canada writes, \"you need to know you don't get there in a day, or week, or month. It takes years of preparation to be willing to commit murder, to be willing to kill or die for a corner, a color, or a leather jacket.\"",

He writes to comics, corporations, children, presidents, and even his daughter's boyfriend. Here is Groucho swapping photos with T. S. Eliot (\u201dI had no idea you were so handsome!\u201d); advising his son on courting a rich dame (\u201dDon't come out bluntly and say, 'How much dough have you got?' That wouldn't be the Marxian way\u201d); crisply declining membership in a Hollywood club (\u201dI don't care to belong to any social organization that will accept me as a member\u201d); reacting with utmost composure when informed that he has been made into a verb by James Joyce (\u201dThere's no reason why I shouldn't appear in <i>Finnegans Wake</i> . I'm certainly as bewildered about life as Joyce was\u201d); responding to a scandal sheet (\u201dGentleman: If you continue to publish slanderous pieces about me, I shall feel compelled to cancel my subscription\u201d); describing himself to the Lunts (\u201dI eat like a vulture. Unfortunately the resemblance doesn't end there\u201d); and much, much more. That mobile visage, that look of wild amazement, and that weaving cigar are wholly captured, bound but untamed, in <i>The Groucho Letters.</i>",

But when their plans backfire, Jim and Jack are indentured by their elusive marks and are forced to build a meaningless wall with bricks gathered from ruins of an Irish castle. Time passes, their debts mount, and anger builds as the two struggle to dig themselves out of their Kafkaesque serfdom.<br /><br /><i>New York </i>Times-bestselling author Paul Auster (<i>The New York Trilogy)</i> brings us back into his strange, shape-shifting world of fiendish bargains and punitive whims, where chance is a powerful yet unpredictable force.",

Longman explores the issues this unprecedented achievement has raised: the importance of the players as role models; the significance of race and class; the sexualization of the team members; and the differences between men and women's sports. Provocative and insightful, this book reminds us that the real struggles are off the field -- and some remain to be won.",

    "description": "Seekers of all ages have been inspired by the stirring message of <i>Old Turtle</i>, the beloved, award-winning wisdom tale of peace. Now Old Turtle returns in a timeless story about love, acceptance, and the nature of truth.<br /><br /> Long ago, as truth descended onto earth, it split in two: one piece landing among the people and the other blazing through the sky. When the people discover the piece of truth, it gives them strength and happiness. But over time, it turns them arrogant and greedy. They do not share their truth with others, wars rage on, and the earth begins to suffer. Then a Little Girl eager for change journeys to find Old Turtle, seeking the precious piece of wisdom that will mend the people's broken truth, making it -- and them -- whole once again.<br /><br /> Douglas Wood's stirring and eloquent fable, soulfully illustrated in luminous watercolor by Jon J Muth, offers readers of all ages inspiration, hope, and a healing vision of peace.",

    "description": "How has Mrs. Olinski chosen her sixth-grade Academic Bowl team? She had a number of answers. But were any of them true? How had she really chosen Noah and Nadia and Ethan and Julian? And why did they make such a good team? It was a surprise to a lot of people when Mrs. Olinski's team won the sixth-grade Academic Bowl contest at Epiphany Middle School. It was an even bigger surprise when they beat the seventh grade and the eighth grade, too. And when they went on to even greater victories, everyone began to ask: How did it happen?<br /><br />It happened at least partly because Noah had been the best man (quite by accident) at the wedding of Ethan's grandmother and Nadia's grandfather. It happened because Nadia discovered that she could not let a lot of baby turtles die. It happened when Ethan could not let Julian face disaster alone. And it happened because Julian valued something important in himself and saw in the other three something he also valued.<br /><br />Mrs. Olinski, returning to teaching after having been injured in an automobile accident, found that her Academic Bowl team became her answer to finding confidence and success. What she did not know, at least at first, was that her team knew more than she did the answer to why they had been chosen.<br /><br />This is a tale about a team, a class, a school, a series of contests and, set in the midst of this, four jewel-like short stories -- one for each of the team members -- that ask questions and demonstrate surprising answers.",

    "description": "As recalled in <b>Honky</b>, Dalton Conley\u2019s childhood has all of the classic elements of growing up in America. But the fact that he was one of the few white boys in a mostly black and Puerto Rican neighborhood on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side makes Dalton\u2019s childhood unique.<br /><br />At the age of three, he couldn\u2019t understand why the infant daughter of the black separatists next door couldn\u2019t be his sister, so he kidnapped her. By the time he was a teenager, he realized that not even a parent\u2019s devotion could protect his best friend from a stray bullet. Years after the privilege of being white and middle class allowed Conley to leave the projects, his entertaining memoir allows us to see how race and class impact us all. Perfectly pitched and daringly original, <b>Honky</b> is that rare book that entertains even as it informs.",

    "description": "When you are a truly happy Christian, you are also a Buddhist. And vice versa.\" <br /> -- Thich Nhat Hanh Buddha and Christ, perhaps the two most pivotal figures in the history of humankind, each left behind a legacy of teachings and practices that have shaped the lives of billions of people over the course of two millenia. If they were to meet on the road today, what would each think of the other's spiritual views and practices?<br /><br />The bestselling author of \"Peace is Every Step, \" and one of the most beloved Buddhist teachers in the West, Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh has been part of a decades-long dialogue between the two greatest living contemplative traditions, and brings to Christianity an appreciation of its beauty that could be conveyed only by an outsider. In a lucid, meditative prose, he explores the crossroads of compassion and holiness at which the two traditions meet, and reawakens our understanding of both. \"On the altar in my hermitage, \" he says, \"are images of Buddha and Jesus, and I touch both of them as my spiritual ancestors.",

The Art of Possibility combines Benjamin Zander's experience as conductor of the Boston Philharmonic and his talent as a teacher and communicator with psychotherapist Rosamund Stone Zander's genius for designing innovative paradigms for personal and professional fulfillment. <br />The authors' harmoniously interwoven perspectives provide a deep sense of the powerful role that the notion of possibility can play in every aspect of life. Through uplifting stories, parables, and personal anecdotes, the Zanders invite us to become passionate communicators, leaders, and performers whose lives radiate possibility into the world",

So at the age of twelve, Burroughs found himself amidst Victorian squalor living with the doctor\u2019s bizarre family, and befriending a pedophile who resided in the backyard shed. The story of an outlaw childhood where rules were unheard of, and the Christmas tree stayed up all year round, where Valium was consumed like candy, and if things got dull an electroshock- therapy machine could provide entertainment. The funny, harrowing and bestselling account of an ordinary boy\u2019s survival under the most extraordinary circumstances.",

    "description": "In this wickedly funny guide, professional astrologer Hazel Dixon-Cooper casts off sugar-coated astrology in favor of exploring the maladjusted side of the universe. If you want the inside scoop, the real deal, the lowdown on each sun sign, then look no further. It's time to forget those traditional astrology books where Sagittarians are gregarious, Capricorns are ambitious, and Pisceans are dreamers. Instead, enter a world where Archers are loud-mouthed bores, Goats are pompous social climbers, and Fish are chronically helpless. Dixon-Cooper debunks the myths, reveals the flaws, and examines the dubious virtues of each sun sign. Discover how to use your own inner brat to outwit bullies, outmaneuver manipulators, and win those endless games that lovers play. Learn how to deal with those dysfunctional people you encounter every day, including how to:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />contain a Ram's oversized ego<br />calm a raging Bull<br />keep a fickle Twin faithful<br />Irreverent, biting, and laugh-out-loud funny, <i>Born on a Rotten Day</i> exaggerates the bad, exorcises the good, and puts a new spin on the age-old question -- what's your sign?",

Accompanying her husband to an analysts\u2019 conference in Vienna, she ditches him and strikes out on her own, crisscrossing Europe in search of a man who can inspire uninhibited passion.

It is a tour through the philosophy and psychology of architecture that aims to change the way we think about our homes, our streets and ourselves.",

    "description": "Elmore Leonard meets Franz Kafka in the wild, improbably true story of the legendary outlaw of Budapest. Attila Ambrus was a gentleman thief, a sort of Cary Grant--if only Grant came from Transylvania and was a terrible professional hockey goalkeeper. During the 1990s, while playing for the biggest hockey team in Budapest, Ambrus took up bank robbery to make ends meet. Arrayed against him was perhaps the most incompetent team of crime investigators the Eastern Bloc had ever seen: a robbery chief who had learned how to be a detective by watching dubbed Columbo episodes; a forensics man who wore top hat and tails on the job; and a driver so inept he was known only by a Hungarian word that translates to Mound of Ass-Head.<br /><br /><i>Ballad of the Whiskey Robber</i> is the completely bizarre and hysterical story of the crime spree that made a nobody into a somebody, and told a forlorn nation that sometimes the brightest stars come from the blackest holes. Julian Rubinstein's bizarre crime story is so odd and so compelling that it is completely irresistible.",

    "description": "Die Sonnenunterg\u00e4nge liebt der kleine Prinz und das frische Wasser alter Ziehbrunnen. Von seinem Planeten, der kaum gr\u00f6\u00dfer ist als er selbst, reist er mit Hilfe eines Vogelzuges zur Erde. Er l\u00e4sst nicht viel zur\u00fcck: ein paar winzige Vulkane, auf denen er immer sein Essen gekocht hat, und eine recht eigenwillige Rose. Dennoch stimmt ihn der Abschied traurig, denn er wei\u00df nicht, ob er je zur\u00fcckkommen wird. Auf seiner Reise besucht er die verschiedensten Sterne und lernt sonderbare Menschen kennen: einen K\u00f6nig, der nur \u00fcber eine alte Ratte regiert, einen Eitlen, dem alle Besucher applaudieren sollen, einen Gesch\u00e4ftsmann, der die Sterne wie Geld auf der Bank deponieren will. Endlich gelangt er zu Erde. Hier erf\u00e4hrt er wichtige Wahrheiten von einem Fuchs, der ein echter Freund f\u00fcr ihn wird. Er lernt, dass man die Dinge nicht oberfl\u00e4chlich, nach ihrem \u00e4u\u00dferen Schein beurteilen darf und dass man f\u00fcr alles, was man liebt, verantwortlich ist.",

Kennedy</b>, <b>Don DeLillo</b> chronicles <b>Lee Harvey Oswald</b>'s odyssey from troubled teenager to a man of precarious stability who imagines himself an agent of history. When \"history\" presents itself in the form of two disgruntled CIA operatives who decide that an unsuccessful attempt on the life of the president will galvanize the nation against communism, the scales are irrevocably tipped.A gripping, masterful blend of fact and fiction, alive with meticulously portrayed characters both real and created, <b>Libra</b> is a grave, haunting, and brilliant examination of an event that has become an indelible part of the American psyche.",

    "description": "In the early 1300s, Dante Alighieri set out to write the three volumes which make the up <em>The Divine Comedy. Purgatorio</em> is the second volume in this set and opens with Dante the poet picturing Dante the pilgrim coming out of the pit of hell. Similar to the <em>Inferno</em> (34 cantos), this volume is divided into 33 cantos, written in tercets (groups of 3 lines). The English prose is arranged in tercets to facilitate easy correspondence to the verse form of the Italian on the facing page, enabling the reader to follow both languages line by line. In an effort to capture the peculiarities of Dante's original language, this translation strives toward the literal and sheds new light on the shape of the poem. Again the text of <em>Purgatorio</em> follows Petrocchi's <em>La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata</em>, but the editor has departed from Petrocchi's readings in a number of cases, somewhat larger than in the previous <em>Inferno</em>, not without consideration of recent critical readings of the <em>Comedy</em> by scholars such as Lanza (1995, 1997) and Sanguineti (2001). As before, Petrocchi's punctuation has been lightened and American norms have been followed. However, without any pretensions to being \"critical,\" the text presented here is electic and being not persuaded of the exclusive authority of any manuscript, the editor has felt free to adopt readings from various branches of the stemma. One major addition to this second volume is in the notes, where is found the <em>Intercantica</em> - a section for each canto that discusses its relation to the <em>Inferno</em> and which will make it easier for the reader to relate the different parts of the <em>Comedy</em> as a whole.<br />",

    "description": "It was a clear spring day, Monday, March 20, 1995, when five members of the religious cult Aum Shinrikyo conducted chemical warfare on the Tokyo subway system using sarin, a poison gas twenty-six times as deadly as cyanide. The unthinkable had happened, a major urban transit system had become the target of a terrorist attack.<br /> \u00a0<br /> In an attempt to discover why, Haruki Murakami, internationally acclaimed author of <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle </i>and arguably Japan\u2019s most important contemporary novelist, talked to the people who lived through the catastrophe\u2014from a Subway Authority employee with survivor guilt, to a fashion salesman with more venom for the media than for the perpetrators, to a young cult member who vehemently condemns the attack though he has not quit Aum. Through these and many other voices, Murakami exposes intriguing aspects of the Japanese psyche. And as he discerns the fundamental issues leading to the attack, we achieve a clear vision of an event that could occur anytime, anywhere. Hauntingly compelling and inescapably important, <i>Underground</i> is a powerful work of journalistic literature from one of the world\u2019s most perceptive writers.",

The message is clear: Bug off!<br />At what point do these druggies threaten national security? When can a nation act against its enemies? These are questions Jack Ryan must answer because someone has quietly stepped over the line.<br />Does anyone know who the real enemy is? How much action is too much? Which lines have been crossed? Ryan and his \"dark side\", a shadowy field officer known only as Mr. Clark, are charged with finding out. They expect danger from without... but the danger from within may be the greatest of all.",

    "description": "In December of 666 A.D., Fidelma of Cashel and her companion Brother Eadulf, having completed their business with the Archbishop of Canterbury, make one final journey before returning to Ireland. At the insistence of Brother Botulf, a childhood friend of Eadulf, they detour from their trip to Eadulf's home village and make their way to Aldred's Abbey. Arriving at midnight on the night of the old pagan festival of Yule, as requested, they find Botulf's dead body - his head caved in by a blunt instrument. <br />As Fidelma and Eadulf soon learn, however, murder isn't the only danger which faces those in the abbey. The ghost of a young woman haunts the cloister shadows, a ghost which closely resembles the Abbot's dead wife. Now it will require all of Fidelma's skill as an advocate of the Brehon Courts to unravel the mystery and uncover the truth behind these events before those secrets take yet another life.<br />",

    "description": "THE SANDMAN is the most acclaimed and award-winning comics series of the 1990s for good reason: a smart and deeply brooding epic, elegantly penned by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by a rotating cast of comics' most sought-after artists, it is a rich blend of modern myth and dark fantasy in which contemporary fiction, historical drama, and legend are seamlessly interwoven. The saga of THE SANDMAN encompasses a series of tales unique in graphic literature and is a story you will never forget.<br /><br />Caught in the vortex of a reality storm, wayfarers from throughout time, myth and the imagination converge on a mysterious inn at WORLD'S END. In the tradition of Chaucer's <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, as the travellers all wait out the tempest that rages around them, they share stories of the places they've been, the things they've seen... and those that they've dreamed.<br /><br />WORLD'S END is the eighth volume of eleven in THE SANDMAN LIBRARY. These books can be read in order or as individual volumes.<br /><br /><br /><i>Description from back cover</i>",

    "description": "When Neal Gaiman penned the seventy-fifth issue of <i>The Sandman</i> he made history in two ways. For the first time in comic book history, a profitable on-going series was being brought to a conclusion. More importantly the threads that he began to spin in the very first issue are now brought together and tied together in a loose bundle that wraps the whole package up nicely and yet leaves him the option to slip another present into the bundle at some later date.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Sandman: The Wake</i> is comprised of the last six issues of the regular <i>Sandman</i> comic book series. The first three cover the actual wake of Morpheus, King of Dreams. In this story within a story characters from the series meet to remember and pay their respects to the fallen immortal. In eulogies which alternate between respect, praise and villification, the Dream Lord's character is summed up and his flaws laid bare to, literally, all the world.<br /><br /><br /><br />In the final chapter of <i>The Wake</i> the reader is returned to an earlier time in the saga of the Sandman, when an aging \"William Shekespeare\" having just completed his final play \"The Tempest,\" commissioned at the bequest of the Dream Lord, reflects on his life, his struggles, tragedies and a bargain for greatness he made with Morpheus many years earlier. In perhaps the series' most poigniant line, a statement which ironically becomes the Sandman's own epitaph, Morpheus reveals that he made the bargain because<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>\"...I am the King of Stories, but I have no story of my own.\"</i><br /><br /><br />Carefully balancing melancholy and tragedy with hope and determination the beautifully illustrated and even more beautifully written <i>Sandman: The Wake</i> stands counter to Morpheus' own words and serves as an extrodinary ending to one of the most incredible stories in the history of comics.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>- Joel Feigenbaum</i>",

The older artist, Rainer Maria Rilke (1875\u20131926), replied to the novice in this series of letters \u2014 an amazing archive of remarkable insights into the ideas behind Rilke's greatest poetry. The ten letters reproduced here were written during an important stage in Rilke's artistic development, and they contain many of the themes that later appeared in his best works. The poet himself afterwards stated that his letters contained part of his creative genius, making this volume essential reading for scholars, poetry lovers, and anyone with an interest in Rilke, German poetry, or the creative impulse.",

    "description": "Most Americans take for granted their right to vote, whether they choose to exercise it or not. But the history of suffrage in the U.S. is, in fact,the story of a struggle to achieve this right by our society's marginalized groups. In The Right to Vote, Duke historian Alexander Keyssar explores the evolution of suffrage over the course of the nation's history. Examining the many features of the history of the right to vote in the U.S.\u2014class, ethnicity, race, gender, religion, and age\u2014the book explores the conditions under which American democracy has expanded and contracted over the years.Keyssar presents convincing evidence that the history of the right to vote has not been one of a steady history of expansion and increasing inclusion, noting that voting rights contracted substantially in the U.S. between 1850 and 1920. Keyssar also presents a controversial thesis: that the primary factor promoting the expansion of the suffrage has been war and the primary factors promoting contraction or delaying expansion have been class tension and class conflict.",

    "description": "Few first novels have created as much popular excitement as <b>The Pickwick Papers</b>\u2013-a comic masterpiece that catapulted its 24-year-old author to immediate fame. Readers were captivated by the adventures of the poet Snodgrass, the lover Tupman, the sportsman Winkle &amp;, above all, by that quintessentially English Quixote, Mr Pickwick, &amp; his cockney Sancho Panza, Sam Weller. From the hallowed turf of Dingley Dell Cricket Club to the unholy fracas of the Eatanswill election, via the Fleet debtor\u2019s prison, characters &amp; incidents sprang to life from Dickens\u2019s pen, to form an enduringly popular work of ebullient humour &amp; literary invention.",

    "description": "At once the most lucrative, popular, and culturally oppositional musical force in the United States, hip hop demands the kind of interpretation Imani Perry provides here: criticism engaged with this vibrant musical form on its own terms. A scholar and a fan, Perry considers the art, politics, and culture of hip hop through an analysis of song lyrics, the words of the prophets of the hood. Recognizing prevailing characterizations of hip hop as a transnational musical form, Perry advances a powerful argument that hip hop is first and foremost black American music. At the same time, she contends that many studies have shortchanged the aesthetic value of rap by attributing its form and content primarily to socioeconomic factors. Her innovative analysis revels in the artistry of hip hop, revealing it as an art of innovation, not deprivation.Perry offers detailed readings of the lyrics of many hip hop artists, including Ice Cube, Public Enemy, De La Soul, krs-One, OutKast, Sean \u201cPuffy\u201d Combs, Tupac Shakur, Lil\u2019 Kim, Biggie Smalls, Nas, Method Man, and Lauryn Hill. She focuses on the cultural foundations of the music and on the form and narrative features of the songs\u2014the call and response, the reliance on the break, the use of metaphor, and the recurring figures of the trickster and the outlaw. Perry also provides complex considerations of hip hop\u2019s association with crime, violence, and misogyny. She shows that while its message may be disconcerting, rap often expresses brilliant insights about existence in a society mired in difficult racial and gender politics. Hip hop, she suggests, airs a much wider, more troubling range of black experience than was projected during the civil rights era. It provides a unique public space where the sacred and the profane impulses within African American culture unite.",

    "description": "Having outlined a theory of bullshit and falsehood, Harry G. Frankfurt turns to what lies beyond them: the truth, a concept not as obvious as some might expect.<br /><br />Our culture's devotion to bullshit may seem much stronger than our apparently halfhearted attachment to truth. Some people (professional thinkers) won't even acknowledge \"true\" and \"false\" as meaningful categories, and even those who claim to love truth cause the rest of us to wonder whether they, too, aren't simply full of it. Practically speaking, many of us deploy the truth only when absolutely necessary, often finding alternatives to be more saleable, and yet somehow civilization seems to be muddling along. But where are we headed? Is our fast and easy way with the facts actually crippling us? Or is it \"all good\"? Really, what's the use of truth, anyway?<br /><br />With the same leavening wit and commonsense wisdom that animates his pathbreaking work \"On Bullshit,\" Frankfurt encourages us to take another look at the truth: there may be something there that is perhaps too plain to notice but for which we have a mostly unacknowledged yet deep-seated passion. His book will have sentient beings across America asking, \"The truth\u2014why didn't I think of that?\"",

    "description": "Published together for the first time, Eliza Haywood's Anti-Pamela and Henry Fielding's An Apology for the Life of Mrs. Shamela Andrews are the two most important responses to Samuel Richardson's novel Pamela. Anti-Pamela comments on Richardson's representations of work, virtue, and gender, while also questioning the generic expectations of the novel that Pamela establishes, and it provides a vivid portrayal of the material realities of life for a woman in eighteenth-century London. Fielding's Shamela punctures both the figure Richardson established for himself as an author and Pamela's preoccupation with virtue.<br /><br />This Broadview edition also includes a rich selection of historical materials, including writings from the period on sexuality, women's work, Pamela and the print trade, and education and conduct.",

But in that year, Quentin Crisp made the courageous decision to \"come out\" as a homosexual. This exhibitionist with the henna-dyed hair was harassed, ridiculed and beaten. Nevertheless, he claimed his right to be himself\u2014whatever the consequences. <i>The Naked Civil Servant</i> is both a comic masterpiece and a unique testament to the resilience of the human spirit.<br />",

    "description": "In her first published novel, Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen presents us with the subtle portraits of two contrasting but equally compelling heroines. For sensible Elinor Dashwood and her impetuous younger sister Marianne the prospect of marrying the men they love appears remote. In a world ruled by money and self-interest, the Dashwood sisters have neither fortune nor connections. Concerned for others and for social proprieties, Elinor is ill-equipped to compete with self-centered fortune-hunters like Lucy Steele, while Marianne's unswerving belief in the truth of her own feelings makes her more dangerously susceptible to the designs of unscrupulous men.<br /> Through her heroines' parallel experiences of love, loss, and hope, Jane Austen offers a powerful analysis of the ways in which women's lives were shaped by the claustrophobic society in which they had to survive. This revised edition contains new notes, appendices, chronology, and bibliography.",

She gradually falls in love with her cousin Edmund, but when the dazzling and sophisticated Crawfords arrive, and amateur theatricals unleash rivalry and sexual jealousy, Fanny has to fight to retain her independence. This new edition places Mansfield Park in its Regency context and elucidates the theatrical background that pervades the novel.",

    "description": "Jane Austen's first novel\u2014published posthumously in 1818\u2014tells the story of Catherine Morland and her dangerously sweet nature, innocence, and sometime self-delusion. Though Austen's fallible heroine is repeatedly drawn into scrapes while vacationing at Bath and during her subsequent visit to Northanger Abbey, Catherine eventually triumphs, blossoming into a discerning woman who learns truths about love, life, and the heady power of literature. The satirical novel pokes fun at the gothic novel while earnestly emphasizing caution to the female sex.",

    "description": "<b>Cakes and Ale</b> is a delicious satire of London literary society between the Wars. Social climber Alroy Kear is flattered when he is selected by Edward Driffield's wife to pen the official biography of her lionized novelist husband, and determined to write a bestseller. But then Kear discovers the great novelist's voluptuous muse (and unlikely first wife), Rosie. The lively, loving heroine once gave Driffield enough material to last a lifetime, but now her memory casts an embarrissing shadow over his career and respectable image. Wise, witty, deeply satisfying, <b>Cakes and Ale</b> is Maugham at his best.",

    "description": "Der Stamm der Kalmischi wei\u00df keinen Ausweg mehr. Die Herden werden von der Seuche dezimiert, die Steuereintreiber bedr\u00e4ngen sie, die Blutrache droht. Da ziehen die M\u00e4nner und Frauen in die Berge. Weil sie sich \u00fcber jedes Gesetz stellen und zu R\u00e4ubern werden, beginnen die Legenden um sie zu wachsen. Heimlicher Held dieses epischen Romans aber ist das Land Chorassan, die Wiege der nomadischen Kultur, mit seinen Steppen, Bergen und Naturgewalten, seinen uralten St\u00e4dten, geduckten D\u00f6rfern und stolzen Zeltsiedlungen. Auf diesem Hintergrund leuchtender Farben zeichnet Doulatabadi das Geflecht intensivster Regungen und Verstrickungen, das die Menschen in der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe ihrer Gef\u00fchle aneinanderkettet. Der Reichtum von Doulatabadis Sprache scheint unersch\u00f6pflich. Er spielt mit den Techniken der traditionellen Vortragskunst und bricht sie durch einen modernen assoziativen Fluss des Erz\u00e4hlens. \u00bbKelidar\u00ab, so Mahmud Doulatabadi, ist ein Buch der Liebe: Liebe zwischen Mann und Frau, die Liebe zwischen Freunden, die Liebe des Menschen zur Erde und zur Natur, zwischen Mensch und Tier. \u00bbKelidar\u00ab wurde 1968 bis 1983 geschrieben und erschien zwischen 1979 und 1984. Der vollst\u00e4ndige Zyklus umfasst zehn B\u00fccher in f\u00fcnf B\u00e4nden. Die ersten beiden, in sich abgeschlossenen Teile erscheinen auf Deutsch in diesem Band.",

    "description": "Written in the wake of <i>Jurassic Park</i>'s phenomenal box-office success, <i>The Lost World</i> seems as much a guidebook for Hollywood types hard at work on the franchise's followup as it is a legitimate sci-fi thriller. Which begs the inevitable questions: Is the plot a rehash of the first book? Sure it is, with the action unfolding on yet another secluded island, the mysterious \"Site B.\" Is the cast of characters basically the same? Absolutely, from a freshly minted pair of cute, compu-savvy kids right down to the neatly exhumed chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (who was presumed dead at the close of <i>JP</i>). But is it fun to read? You betcha. Hollywood (and Michael Crichton) keeps telling us the same old stories for a very good reason: we like them. And the pulp SF formula Crichton has mastered with <i>Jurassic Park</i> and <i>The Lost World</i> is no exception. <i>--Paul Hughes</i>",

    "description": "These three internationally acclaimed novels have confirmed Agota Kristof's reputation as one of the most provocative exponents of new-wave European fiction. With all the stark simplicity of a fractured fairy tale, the trilogy tells the story of twin brothers, Claus and Lucas, locked in an agonizing bond that becomes a gripping allegory of the forces that have divided \"brothers\" in much of Europe since World War II. Kristof's postmodern saga begins with The Notebook, in which the brothers are children, lost in a country torn apart by conflict, who must learn every trick of evil and cruelty merely to survive. In The Proof, Lucas is challenging to prove his own identity and the existence of his missing brother, a defector to the \"other side.\" The Third Lie, which closes the trilogy, is a biting parable of Eastern and Western Europe today and a deep exploration into the nature of identity, storytelling, and the truths and untruths that lie at the heart of them all. \"Stark and haunting.\" - The San Francisco Chronicle; \"A vision of considerable depth and complexity, a powerful portrait of the nobility and perversity of the human heart.\" - The Christian Science Monitor.",

In the fifteen hundred years since his passing, the Empire has fallen into ruin. The great Scattering saw millions abandon the crumbling civilization and spread out beyond the reaches of known space. The planet Arrakis-now called Rakis-has reverted to its desert climate, and its great sandworms are dying.<p>Now, the Lost Ones are returning home in pursuit of power. And as factions vie for control over the remnants of the Empire, a girl named Sheeana rises to prominence in the wastelands of Rakis, sending religious fervor throughout the galaxy. For she possesses the abilities of the Fremen sandriders-fulfilling a prophecy foretold by the late God Emperor...</p>",

With refreshingly open-minded curiosity, William Dalrymple explores the seven \"dead\" cities of Delhi as well as the eighth city-today's Delhi. Underlying his quest is the legend of the djinns, fire-formed spirits that are said to assure the city's Phoenix-like regeneration no matter how many times it is destroyed. Entertaining, fascinating, and informative, <i>City of Djinns</i> is an irresistible blend of research and adventure.",

    "description": "Since the Stone Age, drugs have been sniffed to induce sleep, mixed to cure ills, swallowed to stimulate creativity, snorted to increase sexuality, popped for the hell of it and smoked to see God.<br /><br />Natural or synthesized, they have been smuggled for all kinds of reasons from saving the world to becoming stinking rich. Blamed for deaths, wars, suicides, collapses of governments, multiple crashes, individual crises, anarchy and chaos, they have also been praised for opening minds and expanding consciousness.<br /><br />Worshipped and demonised, venerated and chastised, force-fed and forbidden. Every society has had its intoxicant, be it sacrament or scourge.<br /><br />They have also become irreversibly interwoven with politics, sex, business, religion, and rock and roll, providing writers, whether emerging from the ancient classical world or the street laboratory of today, with both inspiration and challenge.<br /><br />An unforgettable, once-in-a-lifetime trip, <i>The Howard Marks Book of Dope Stories</i> includes his favourite drugs writings from Alexander Dumas to Aleister Crowley via Hunter S. Thompson and Charles Baudelaire, as well as unpublished works and many new and compelling pieces from Mr Nice himself.",

They regard their disappointment in him as an act of betrayal on his part, and react violently.",

    "description": "The author initially intended to call this novel <em>The Lyrical Age</em>. The lyrical age, according to Kundera, is youth, and this novel, above all, is an epic of adolescence; an ironic epic that tenderly erodes sacrosanct values: childhood, motherhood, revolution, and even poetry. Jaromil is in fact a poet. His mother made him a poet and accompanies him (figuratively) to his love bed, and (literally) to his deathbed. A ridiculous and touching character, horrifying and totally innocent (\"innocence with its bloody smile\"!), Jaromil is at the same time a true poet. He's no creep, he's Rimbaud. Rimbaud entrapped by the communist revolution, entrapped in a sombre farce.",

Cruel and noble, evilly and fatally desirable to women, Dracula possesses a terrifying lust for power and, like Dr Jekyll or Conan Doyle's Moriarty, is one of the immortal fictional monsters.",

As a boy, he lives to decipher the odors of Paris, and apprentices himself to a prominent perfumer who teaches him the ancient art of mixing precious oils and herbs. But Grenouille's genius is such that he is not satisfied to stop there, and he becomes obsessed with capturing the smells of objects such as brass doorknobs and fresh-cut wood. Then one day he catches a hint of a scent that will drive him on an ever-more-terrifying quest to create the \"ultimate perfume\" \u2014 the scent of a beautiful young virgin. Told with dazzling narrative brillance, <b>Perfume</b> is a hauntingly powerful tale of murder and sensual depravity.<br /><br />Translated from the German by John E. Woods.",

    "description": "<div>Sarai was a child of ten years, wise for her age but not yet a woman, when she first met Abram. He appeared before her in her father's house, filthy from the desert, tired and thirsty. But as the dirt of travel was washed from his body, the sight of him filled her heart. And when Abram promises Sarai to return in ten years to take her for his wife, her fate was sealed.<br /><br />Abram kept his promise, and Sarai kept hers they were wed, and so joined the royal house of Ur with the high priesthood of the Hebrews. So began a lifetime of great joy together, and greater peril: and with the blessing of their God, a great nation would be built around the core of their love.<br /><br />Bestselling author Orson Scott Card uses his fertile imagination, and uncanny insight into human nature, to tell the story of a unique woman--one who is beautiful, tough, smart, and resourceful in an era when women had little power, and are scarce in the historical record. Sarah, child of the desert, wife of Abraham, takes on vivid reality as a woman desirable to kings, a devoted wife, and a faithful follower of the God of Abraham, chosen to experience an incomparable miracle.<br /></div>",

    "description": "Bryony Ashley knows that Ashley Court, the grand estate, is both hell and paradise -- once elegant and beautiful, yet shrouded in shadow. After the tragic death of her father, Bryony returns from abroad to find that his estate is to become the responsibility of her cousin Emory. Her family's estate with its load of debt is no longer her worry. Still, her father's final, dire warning about a terrible family curse haunts her days and her dreams. And there is something odd about her father's sudden death... <br /><br />Bryony has inherited the Ashley 'Sight' and so has one of the Ashleys. Since childhood the two have communicated through thought patterns, though Bryony has no idea of his identity. Devastated, she believes, that the mysterious stranger is her destiny... the lover-to-be who waits for her now at Ashley Court. Now she is determined to find him. But passion is not all that will greet Bryony upon her return -- for the crumbling walls of the old mansion guard dark secrets, tragic memories... and inescapable peril.",

But when two joggers are found slain in a manner that suggests a macabre ritual, he has to reconsider. Someone believes in vampires enough to have committed a series of bizarre murders that appear to be the work of one. Local police are horrified, and even the FBI is baffled.<p>Cross takes on the case and plunges into a netherworld of secret clubs and role-players, a world full of poseurs and playactors-and someone demented enough to have crossed the line from dark ritual to real blood. At the same time, a lethal super-criminal from Cross's past known as the Mastermind is stalking him, taunting him, and threatening everything he holds dear. Cross has never been closer to defeat, or in greater danger. In a shocking conclusion, Alex Cross must survive a deadly confrontation-only to discover at last the awful secret of the Mastermind.</p>",

Still, with the help of her best buddy, Grey, she may somehow overcome the wedding that wasn't. That is, until Grey gets engaged to Zadie's prim and proper cousin Helen, and Zadie is dragged back into wedding festivity hell. The coup de gr\u00e2ce is Helen's bachelorette party, thrown by her clique of prissy friends and certain to be a day of torture. But when the Pinor Grigio goes down and the sweater sets come off, things get out of control. Helen turns into a girl gone wild and manages to get herself into a sticky situation that just might sink the happy couple for good. And meanwhile, Zadie's own love life takes a most unexpected turn. Karen Lutz throws one bachelorette party you won't soon forget.",

And I keep turning over in my mind the thought that I am at the end of the earth, in a place which you do not know and which your whole lives through you will never visit.</i><br /><br />It is 1640 and Father Sebastian Rodrigues, an idealistic Jesuit priest, sets sail for Japan determined to help the brutally oppressed Christians there. He is also desperate to discover the truth about his former mentor, rumoured to have renounced his faith under torture. Rodrigues cannot believe the stories about a man he so revered, but as his journey takes him deeper into Japan and then into the hands of those who would crush his faith, he finds himself forced to make an impossible choice: whether to abandon his flock or his God.<br /><br />The recipient of the 1966 Tanizaki Prize, Silence is Shusaku Endo's most highly acclaimed work and has been called one of the twentieth century's finest novels. As empathetic as it is powerful, it is an astonishing exploration of faith and suffering and an award-winning classic.",

    "description": "In <b>A Continent for the Taking</b> Howard W. French, a veteran correspondent for <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i>, gives a compelling firsthand account of some of Africa\u2019s most devastating recent history\u2013from the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko, to Charles Taylor\u2019s arrival in Monrovia, to the genocide in Rwanda and the Congo that left millions dead. Blending eyewitness reportage with rich historical insight, French<i> </i>searches deeply into the causes of today\u2019s events, illuminating the debilitating legacy of colonization and the abiding hypocrisy and inhumanity of both Western and African political leaders. <br /><br />While he captures the tragedies that have repeatedly befallen Africa\u2019s peoples, French also opens our eyes to the immense possibility that lies in Africa\u2019s complexity, diversity, and myriad cultural strengths. The culmination of twenty-five years of passionate exploration and understanding, this is a powerful and ultimately hopeful book about a fascinating and misunderstood continent.",

The ancient Aegean sorcery lives on.<br /><br />Theseus bested the Minotaur with the aid of Ariadne, Mistress of the Labyrinth. So when Theseus betrays her, Ariadne turns her wrath upon him and all his world, the catastrophe strikes the Mediterranean. Thera explodes, Atlantis sinks below the waves, poisons fill the air, tidal waves inundate nations, entire peoples are destroyed.<br /><br />Amid the chaos, the great city of Troy falls, undone as much by Ariadne's revenge as by Greek cunning. Among the scattered Trojans wanders one man, Brutus, who carries with him the Troy Game, the greatest secret the western world has ever known. And Ariadne wants it \u2013 badly. As do her wicked daughter-heir successors.<br /><br />The Greek goddess, Artemis appears to Brutus and offers him a splendid and powerful future if only he can resurrect the Troy Game. Hungry for power and a home for his people, Brutus accepts her challenge. And so the Troy Game begins, on the shores of the Thames in ancient Iron Age Britain.<br /><br />But the malevolent Minotaur, Asterion, has escaped death and seeks to destroy the Game completely. And Cornelia, Brutus\u2019 strange, unknowable wife, trails death in her wake.<br /><br />Everywhere lurks Ariadne\u2019s legacy of hatred, carrying western Europe into a maelstrom of darkness",

    "description": "Finally back in print, this special 40th anniversary edition of Dr. Schonfield's international multimillioncopy bestseller is set to rock the establishment view of the life of Jesus all over again.<br /><br />There is probably no other figure in modern Jewish historical research who is more controversial or famous than Hugh J. Schonfield, who once said: \"The scholars deplore that I have spilled the beans to the public. Several of them have said to me, 'You ought to have kept this just among ourselves, you know.'\"<br /><br />What he did to \"spill the beans\" was present historical evidence suggesting that Jesus was a mortal man, a young genius who believed himself to be the Messiah and deliberately and brilliantly planned his entire ministry according to the Old Testament prophecies--even to the extent of plotting his own arrest, crucifixion and resurrection.<br /><br />Since Schonfield's death in 1988, his popularity and the interest in his prodigious work, which included over 40 books, has drawn increasing attention, particularly outside Judaism. In fact, it is probably fair to say that his contribution to the Gentile understanding of Jewish aspirations among those within the Christian cultural framework has been without parallel. In true Christian tradition, he has also been the cause of much contention.<br /><br />In the wake of resurgent interest in religious history spurred by Mel Gibson's <i>The Passion of the Christ</i> and Dan Brown's <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, this 40th anniversary edition of <i>The Passover Plot</i> is set to engage a completely new generation of readers searching for truth.",

But what it's definitely about is Weetzie Bat, her best friend Dirk and their search across L.A. for the most dangerous angel of all ...true love.",

    "description": "Driven from his home by the Ku Klux Klan and still reeling from the death of his mother, Nathan moves with his father and grandfather to the desolate Pea Island on the Outer Banks of North Carolina to start a new life. Fortunately, life on Pea Island at the end of the 19th century is far from quiet.\u00a0\u00a0The other island residents include the surfmen--the African American crew of the nearby U.S. Life-Saving Station--and soon Nathan is lending an extra hand to these men as they rescue sailors from sinking ships. Working and learning alongside the courageous surfmen, Nathan begins to dream of becoming one himself. But the reality of post-Civil War racism starts to show itself as he gradually realizes the futility of his dream. And then another dream begins to take shape, one that Nathan refuses to let anyone take from him.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover Library Binding edition.</i>",

Sorcha is the light in their lives, they are determined that she know only contentment.<br /><br />But Sorcha's joy is shattered when her father is bewitched by his new wife, an evil enchantress who binds her brothers with a terrible spell, a spell which only Sorcha can lift-by staying silent. If she speaks before she completes the quest set to her by the Fair Folk and their queen, the Lady of the Forest, she will lose her brothers forever. <br /><br />When Sorcha is kidnapped by the enemies of Sevenwaters and taken to a foreign land, she is torn between the desire to save her beloved brothers, and a love that comes only once. Sorcha despairs at ever being able to complete her task, but the magic of the Fair Folk knows no boundaries, and love is the strongest magic of them all...",

    "description": "In a thrilling debut that combines storytelling mastery with a treasure trove of folklore, Cecilia Dart-Thornton creates a lushly romantic epic adventure, set in a world brimming with wonders and terrors.<br /><br />The Stormriders land their splendid winged stallions on the battlements of Isse Tower, while the scullions who dwell in the fortress's lower depths rarely even see the sun. Yet it is the least of the lowly--a mute, scarred foundling youth--who dares to climb the Tower, stow away aboard a Windship, and dive from the sky into a wilderness of endless danger. For goblins, peskies, knocks, and all the eldrich wights of the Unseelie haunt every tree, every pool, every turn in the road, tormenting or killing unwary travelers. And unknown to the nameless one, somewhere a dark force is summoning the malignant hordes, determined to destroy the young mute's identity, history...and destiny.",

Shadow, a light-hearted (and light-fingered) elven thief, returns to her homeland after several centuries' absence only to find that a great human trade city has grown up next to the forest in which she was born. Now the elves and the humans maintain an uneasy alliance, but when Shadow steals a magical bracelet, she finds herself caught in the middle of a plot that may tear the city-and the alliance-apart forever.",

    "description": "The now-classic memoir that shocked, outraged, and ultimately changed the way America looked at the civil rights movement and the black experience.<br /><br />By turns shocking and lyrical, unblinking and raw, the searingly honest memoirs of Eldridge Cleaver are a testament to his unique place in American history. Cleaver writes in <b>Soul on Ice</b>, \"I'm perfectly aware that I'm in prison, that I'm a Negro, that I've been a rapist, and that I have a Higher Uneducation.\" What Cleaver shows us, on the pages of this now classic autobiography, is how much he was a man.",

    "description": "Maybe Mab was real. Maybe not. Maybe Mab was the fury. Maybe she was the courage. Maybe later on she was the sex . . .<br />A tiny fairy winging her way through the jasmine-scented L.A. night. A little girl caught in a grown-up glitz-and-glitter world of superstars and supermodels. A too beautiful boy with a secret he can never share . . .<br /><br />From the author of <em>Weetzie Bat</em> comes a magical, mesmerizing tale of transformation. This is the story of Barbie Marks, who dreams of being the one behind the Cyclops eye of the camera, not the voiceless one in front of it; who longs to run away to New York City where she can be herself, not some barley flesh-and-blood version of the plastic doll she was named after. It is the story of Griffin Tyler, whose androgynous beauty hides the dark pain he holds inside. And finally it is the story of Mab, a pinkie-sized, magenta-haired, straight-talking fairy, who may or may not be real but who helps Barbie and Griffin uncover the strength beneath the pain, and who teaches that love\u2014like a sparkling web of light spinning around our bodies and our souls\u2014is what can heal even the deepest scars.",

    "description": "Meet Tweetie Sweet Pea and Peachy Pie, Jacaranda and Rave and Desiree...<br /><br />Meet Lady Ivory and Alabaster Dutchess, who interview their favorite rock star, Nick Agate, only to discover the magic and power in themselves. Meet Tuck Budd, who is happy living in Manhattan with her two moms, Izzy and Anastasia, until she begins to wonder who her father is. Meet La, who faces the loss of her mother with an imaginary androgynous blue friend who lives in her closet. Zingingly bright and dreamily dark, full of wonder and gritty reality, these stories by acclaimed author Francesca Lia Block show the reader that in every girl there truly is a goddess.<br /><br />The cutting-edge author of Weetzie Bat once again breaks new ground with Girl Goddess #9, nine stories about girl goddesses of every age and shape and color and size, wearing combat boots and spiky hair or dressed all in white. One girl has two moms, another has no mother at all but a strange blue skinned creature that lives in her closet. One is a rock star groupie, another loves dancing and reading poetry and having picnics in the backyard when the moon is full. These are stories about girls discovering that the world is not a simple place and that there is more than one way to live'all in Ms. Block's rich, lyrical language that fans have come to adore and that Sassy magazine called \u2018a dream.'",

It depicts the adventures of Malone, a beautiful young man searching for love amid New York's emerging gay scene. From Manhattan's Everard Baths and after-hours discos to Fire Island's deserted parks and lavish orgies, Malone looks high and low for meaningful companionship. The person he finds is Sutherland, a campy quintessential queen -- and one of the most memorable literary creations of contemporary fiction. Hilarious, witty, and ultimately heartbreaking, <em>Dancer from the Dance</em> is truthful, provocative, outrageous fiction told in a voice as close to laughter as to tears.",

    "description": "A leading M.I.T. social scientist and consultant examines five professions - engineering, architecture, management, psychotherapy, and town planning - to show how professionals really go about solving problems. The best professionals, Donald Sch\ufffdn maintains, know more than they can put into words. To meet the challenges of their work, they rely less on formulas learned in graduate school than on the kind of improvisation learned in practice. This unarticulated, largely unexamined process is the subject of Sch\ufffdn's provocatively original book, an effort to show precisely how 'reflection-in-action' works and how this vital creativity might be fostered in future professionals.",

    "description": "When Jose Canseco burst into the Major Leagues in the 1980s, he changed the sport -- in more ways than one. No player before him possessed his mixture of speed and power, which allowed him to become the first man in history to belt more than forty home runs and swipe more than forty bases in the same season. He won Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player, and a World Series ring.<br /><br />Canseco shattered the mold of the out-of-shape baseball player and ushered in a new era of superathletes who looked like bodybuilders, made outrageous salaries, and enjoyed rock-star lifestyles. And the ticket for this ride? Steroids. Behind the gaudy stats and the glamour of his public life, Canseco cultivated a secret just about everyone in MLB knew about, one that would alter the game of baseball and the way we view our heroes forever. Canseco made himself a guinea pig of the performance-enhancing drugs that were only just beginning to infiltrate the American underground. Anabolic steroids, human growth hormones -- Canseco mixed, matched, and experimented to such a degree that he became known throughout the league as \"The Chemist.\" He passed his knowledge on to trainers and fellow players, and before long, performance-enhancing drugs were running rampant throughout Major League Baseball. Sluggers scooping up pitches at their ankles and blasting them out of the park, pitchers cranking fastballs inning after inning -- Canseco showed the players how to customize their doses to sculpt the bodies they wanted, and baseball as we know it was the result.<br /><br />Today, this issue has crept out of the closet and burst into the headlines as players balloon to herculean proportions and hundred-year-old records are not only broken, but also demolished. In this shocking memoir, Canseco sheds light on a life of dizzying highs and debilitating lows, provides the answers to questions about steroids that millions of fans are only now beginning to ask -- and suggests that, far from being a passing trend, the steroid revolution is only a taste of things to come.<br /><br />Who's juiced? According to Canseco's authoritative account, more than you think. And baseball will never be the same.",

    "description": "When Bill James published his original <i>Historical Baseball Abstract</i> in 1985, he produced an immediate classic, hailed by the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> as the \u201choly book of baseball.\u201d Now, baseball's beloved \u201cSultan of Stats\u201d <i>(The Boston Globe)</i> is back with a fully revised and updated edition for the new millennium.<br /><br />Like the original, <i>The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract</i> is really several books in one. The Game provides a century's worth of American baseball history, told one decade at a time, with energetic facts and figures about How, Where, and by Whom the game was played. In The Players<b>,</b> you'll find listings of the top 100 players at each position in the major leagues, along with James's signature stats-based ratings method called \u201cWin Shares,\u201d a way of quantifying individual performance and calculating the offensive and defensive contributions of catchers, pitchers, infielders, and outfielders. And there's more: the Reference section covers Win Shares for each season and each player, and even offers a Win Share team comparison. A must-have for baseball fans and historians alike, <i>The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract</i> is as essential, entertaining, and enlightening as the sport itself.",

    "description": "<i>Experience and Education</i> is the best concise statement on education ever published by John Dewey, the man acknowledged to be the pre-eminent educational theorist of the twentieth century. Written more than two decades after <i>Democracy and Education</i> (Dewey's most comprehensive statement of his position in educational philosophy), this book demonstrates how Dewey reformulated his ideas as a result of his intervening experience with the progressive schools and in the light of the criticisms his theories had received. <br /><br /> Analyzing both \"traditional\" and \"progressive\" education, Dr. Dewey here insists that neither the old nor the new education is adequate and that each is miseducative because neither of them applies the principles of a carefully developed philosophy of experience. Many pages of this volume illustrate Dr. Dewey's ideas for a philosophy of experience and its relation to education. He particularly urges that all teachers and educators looking for a new movement in education should think in terms of the deeped and larger issues of education rather than in terms of some divisive \"ism\" about education, even such an \"ism\" as \"progressivism.\" His philosophy, here expressed in its most essential, most readable form, predicates an American educational system that respects all sources of experience, on that offers a true learning situation that is both historical and social, both orderly and dynamic.",

He fits into no familiar category for he was at once a biologist and a paleontologist of world renown, and also a Jesuit priest. He applied his whole life, his tremendous intellect and his great spiritual faith to building a philosophy that would reconcile Christian theology with the scientific theory of evolution, to relate the facts of religious experience to those of natural science.<br /><br /><em>The Phenomenon of Man,</em> the first of his writings to appear in America, Pierre Teilhard's most important book and contains the quintessence of his thought. When published in France it was the best-selling nonfiction book of the year.",

    "description": "I AND THOU BY MARTIN BUBER TRANSLATORS INTRODUCTION HIS work in its original, German form has already, since its publication fourteen years ago, exercised on the Continent an influence, quite out of proportion to its slender size. In view of this influence alone it may be affirmed that I and Thou will rank as one of the epochmaking books of our generation. It has hitherto been comparatively unknown among Englishspeaking students of philosophy and theology. I and Thou is to be understood in the context of Bubers previous intensive study, chiefly of Jewish mystical writings. It is not an isolated phenomenon among his works, but represents the culmination of the intensely religious interest that characterises them all. It is, indeed, philosophical but it is not an academic work of discursive philosophy. It is mystical, but it belongs to what PringlePattison has termed the higher Mysticism of real communion with God, as distinguished from the debased1 mysticism that sub stitutes for the real present world a world of illusory delights, where absorption in the Diym is experi enced. The decrying of mysticism as a whole, fashion able today among Protestant writers, has a weighty retort in the present work. For an indubitably real mystical experience is here set forth, not with contempt for the means of human expression but with finished and delicate power. For this reason, though we might call and Thou a philosophicalreligious poem, it belongs essentially to no single specialised class of learned work. It has a direct appeal to all those who are interested in living religious experience rather than in theological debates and the rise and fall of philosophical schools. It has first and foremost to be judged on its intrinsic meritsby the impact, that is to say, which it makes on our actual, responsible life, as persons and as groups, in the modern world. This immediate value of Bubers work becomes clear if we consider its main thesis. There is, Buber shows, a radical difference between a mans attitude to other men and his attitude to things. The attitude to other men is a relation between persons, to things it is a connexion with objects. In the personal relation one subject I confronts another subjectThou, in the connexion with things the subject contemplates and experiences an object. These two attitudes represent the basic twofold situation of human life, the former constituting the. world of Thou, and the latter the world of It The content and relation of these two worlds is the theme of and Thou. The other person, the Thou,, is shown to be a realitythat is, it is given to me, but it is not bounded by me: Thou has no bounds the 1 Though the second person singular pronoun has almost dis appeared from modern English usage, it remains in one important spherein prayer. By its retention in the English text, therefore, far from suggesting an obscure situation, it keeps the whole thought iii the personal and responsible sphere in which alone it is truly to be understood. TJiou cannot be appropriated, but I am brought up short against it.",

He lives on the top floor of a Baltimore row house where he creates collages of little people snipped from wrapping paper. His elderly mother putters in the rooms below, until her death. And it is then that Jeremy is forced to take in Mary Tell and her child as boarders. Mary is unaware of how much courage it takes Jeremy to look her in the eye. For Jeremy, like one of his paper creations, is fragile and easily torn--especially when he's falling in love....",

    "description": "When this stirring work by Philadelphia-born Paris-based sculptress and historical-fiction writer Barbara Chase-Riboud first appeared in 1979, it was dismissed by many mainstream historians as \"hogwash.\" But with DNA evidence proving that Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, did indeed father at least one child by his black slave mistress, Sally Hemings, Chase-Riboud's book deserves a new read. With her painstaking eye for research, Chase-Riboud unfolds a complex 19th-century quilt of miscegenation, denial, hypocrisy, slavery and, yes, love in Virginia. She brings to life Heming's relationship with Martha, her half-sister and the President's wife on his Monticello estate; Jefferson's seduction of Hemings in Paris after Martha's death; and his lifelong concubinage of Hemings until his own death, when she and her offspring were freed. Chase-Riboud avoids the sentimental \"tragic-mulatto trap\" that other writers have fallen into when they deal with slave relations by making Hemings not only multidimensional and believable, but, given late-20th-century political scandals, chillingly contemporary. Along with the novel's other sub-themes, including black disenfranchisement and the fear of reenslavement, Riboud intimates that Jefferson-- despite his racist rantings in <i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i>, which Chase-Riboud uses as epigraphs--may have actually loved this black woman, and that the relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings was perhaps the clearest example of the American imperative of \"seeking a more perfect union,\" a controversial portrayal that Chase-Riboud makes plausible with skillfully written prose. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i>",

Trillin knows that the search for good food requires constant vigilance particularly when outside the Big Apple. Not that Cincinnati and Houston and Kansas City (his hometown) lack magnificent places to eat\u2014if one can resist the importunities of those well-meaning ignoramuses who insist on hauling you off to La Maison de la Casa House, the pride of local epicures too dumb to realize that the noblest culinary creations of the American heartland are barbecued ribs, fried chicken, hash browns and hamburgers. Trillin is ready to do battle for K.C.'s Winstead's as the home of the greatest burger in the USA. Generally, he advises, you will do fine if you avoid \"\"any restaurant the executive secretary of the chamber of commerce is particularly proud of.\"\" Also, any restaurant with (ply)wood paneling and \"\"atmosphere,\"\" where the food is likely to taste \"\"something like a medium-rare sponge.\"\" This then is not a celebration of multi-star \"\"restaurants\"\" but of diners, roadhouses, eateries\u2014the kind that serve food on wax paper or plastic plates and to hell with Craig Claiborne. With tongue in stuffed cheek Trillin gives the finger to the food snobs, confessing his secret vices with fiendish glee and high good humor.",

So with little more than a change of clothes and two bars of soap, Ma takes off to immerse himself in the remotest parts of China. His journey would last three years and take him through smog-choked cities and mountain villages, from scenes of barbarity to havens of tranquility. Remarkably written and subtly moving, the result is an insight into the teeming contradictions of China that only a man who was both insider and outsider in his own country could have written. <br /><i>\n  <br /></i>",

    "description": "<i>Sometime after midnight, on a moonless October night turned harsh by a fine, windswept rain, one of the men I liked least in the world was murdered in a field near Bedford, just south of the city....The detectives went looking for suspects--- people whose histories with Jefferson were adversarial and hostile. At the top of that list, they found me.</i><br /><br />So begins <i>A Welcome Grave,</i> the third novel by award-winning mystery writer Michael Koryta, featuring private investigator Lincoln Perry. Once a rising star on the Cleveland police force, Perry ended his career when he left one of the city's prominent attorneys, Alex Jefferson, bleeding in the parking lot of his country club---retribution for his affair with Perry's fianc\u00e9e.<br /><br />Now Jefferson is dead, the victim of a brutal murder, and his widow has called upon Perry for a favor he knows he shouldn't accept but can't turn down: to find Jefferson's estranged son, partial beneficiary of the dead man's fortune. The case is simple enough, a routine \"locate,\" and he'll be paid plenty of money for the work. The encounter should be simple, too: a brief exchange of information and maybe an empty condolence before Perry gets back into his truck and returns home. Instead, he's loaded into a police car and taken to a rural jail while Jefferson's son is zipped into a body bag.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br /><br />Perry soon learns that Jefferson's millions are the target of a thirst for revenge that hasn't been satisfied by blood. As a pair of deadly assailants push deep into the investigator's life, they bring with them police from two states who are determined to see Perry in jail.",

She would still be the privileged daughter of a doting father and a loving mother. Her life would still be perfect \u2014 with only the tiny cracks of an angry junkie for a brother and a charming drunk with shady underworld connections for an uncle to mar the otherwise flawless whole. <br /><br />But that\u2019s not what happened. Instead, those inconsequential decisions lead her to perform a good deed that puts her in the right place at the right time to unleash a chain of events that brings a mysterious package to her door \u2014 a package which informs her that her entire world is a lie.<br /><br />Suddenly forced to question everything she knows about herself and her family, Ridley wanders into dark territory she never knew existed, where everyone in her life seems like a stranger. She has no idea who\u2019s on her side and who has something to hide\u2014even, and maybe especially, her new lover, Jake, who appears to have secrets of his own.<br /><br />Sexy and fast-paced, Beautiful Lies is a true literary thriller with one of the freshest voices and heroines to arrive in years. Lisa Unger takes us on a breathtaking ride in which every choice Ridley makes creates a whirlwind of consequences that are impossible to imagine . . . .",

    "description": "Bataille's first novel, published under the pseudonym 'Lord Auch', is still his most notorious work. In this explicit pornographic fantasy, the young male narrator and his lovers Simone and Marcelle embark on a sexual quest involving sadism, torture, orgies, madness and defilement, culminating in a final act of transgression. Shocking and sacrilegious, <i>Story of the Eye</i> is the fullest expression of Bataille's obsession with the closeness of sex, violence and death. Yet it is also hallucinogenic in its power, and is one of the erotic classics of the twentieth century. <br /><br />This edition also includes Susan Sontag's superb study of pornography as art, 'The Pornographic Imagination', as well as Roland Barthes' essay 'The Metaphor of the Eye'.<br /><br />Georges Bataille (1897-1962), French essayist and novelist, was born in Billom, France. He converted to Catholicism, then later to Marxism, and was interested in psychoanalysis and mysticism, forming a secret society dedicated to glorifying human sacrifice. Leading a simple life as the curator of a municipal library, Bataille was involved on the fringes of Surrealism, founding the Surrealist magazine <i>Documents</i> in 1929, and editing the literary review <i>Critique</i> from 1946 until his death. Among his other works are the novels <i>Blue of Noon</i> (1957) and <i>My Mother</i> (1966), and the essays <i>Eroticism</i> (1957) and <i>Literature and Evil</i> (1957).",

    "description": "A marked departure from Edith Wharton's usual ironic contemplation of the fashionable New York society to which she herself belonged, Ethan Frome is a sharply etched portrait of the simple inhabitants of a nineteenth-century New England village. The protagonist, Ethan Frome, is a man tormented by passionate love for his ailing wife's young cousin. trapped by the bonds of marriage and the fear of public condemnation, he is ultimately destroyed by that which offers him the greatest chance at happiness.<br /><br />Like The House of Mirth and many of Edith Wharton's other novels, Ethan Frome centers on the power of local convention to smother the growth of the individual. Written with stark simplicity, this powerful and tragic novel has long been considered one of Wharton's greatest works.<br /><br />(back cover)",

    "description": "In 1996, Tom Bissell went to Uzbekistan as a naive Peace Corps volunteer. Though he lasted only a few months before illness and personal crisis forced him home, Bissell found himself entranced by this remote land. Five years later he returned to explore the shrinking Aral Sea, destroyed by Soviet irrigation policies. Joining up with an exuberant translator named Rustam, Bissell slips more than once through the clutches of the Uzbek police as he makes his often wild way to the devastated sea.<br /><br />In <b>Chasing the Sea</b>, <i> </i>Bissell combines the story of his travels with a beguiling chronicle of Uzbekistan\u2019s striking culture and long history of violent subjugation by despots from Jenghiz Khan to Joseph Stalin. Alternately amusing and sobering, this is a gripping portrait of a fascinating place, and the debut of a singularly gifted young writer.",

    "description": "This is the story of Jed Tewksbury, an uprooted and alienated man - not uncommon in our time - told by himself in a style sometimes poetic, sometimes raunchy, an effective blend of his backwoods origin and his scholarly attainments. Jed is born just at the end of the First World War on a run-down farm near the little town of Dugton, Alabama. When he is nine his drunken father dies in a low-comedy accident that becomes part of the obscene folklore of the region. His semi-literate mother has a caustic wit, an iron character, and the determination that Jed will escape the South. As she puts it: \"Git what's to git, then git. Git on.\"<br /><br />A dedicated Latin teacher and Jed's football prowess combine to get him a scholarship at a jerkwater college, whence he enters the graduate school of the University of Chicago and excels in the field of classical and medieval literature. After fighting with the Italian Partisans behind the Nazi lines, Jed returns to the university and marries a woman who dies soon thereafter. He moves to a new job in Nashville and becomes involved in a torrid and ill-fated love affair, the central event of the novel, coloring all the subsequent action. He flees to Paris and then to Chicago; he marries again, fathers a son, and is soon divorced.<br /><br />Middle-aged, and now a figure of world renown, Jed goes back to Dugton for a long-deferred visit to his mother's grave, and - in what must be one of the most moving passages ever written - is able to make some kind of peace with himself and with his past. <i> (Book jacket)</i>",

    "description": "Richard Siken\u2019s <i>Crush</i>, selected as the 2004 winner of the Yale Younger Poets prize, is a powerful collection of poems driven by obsession and love. Siken writes with ferocity, and his reader hurtles unstoppably with him. His poetry is confessional, gay, savage, and charged with violent eroticism. In the world of American poetry, Siken's voice is striking. In her introduction to the book, competition judge Louise Gl\u00fcck hails the \u201ccumulative, driving, apocalyptic power, [and] purgatorial recklessness\u201d of Siken\u2019s poems. She notes, \u201cBooks of this kind dream big. . . . They restore to poetry that sense of crucial moment and crucial utterance which may indeed be the great genius of the form.\u201d",

    "description": "When Julie Summers's car breaks down on a sleazy street in a South African city, a young Arab mechanic named Abdu comes to her aid. Their attraction to one another is fueled by different motives. Julie is in rebellion against her wealthy background and her father; Abdu, an illegal immigrant, is desperate to avoid deportation to his impoverished country. In the course of their relationship, there are unpredictable consequences, and overwhelming emotions will overturn each one's notion of the other. Set in the new South Africa and in an Arab village in the desert, <i>The Pickup</i> is \"a masterpiece of creative empathy . . . a gripping tale of contemporary anguish and unexpected desire, and it also opens the Arab world to unusually nuanced perception\" (Edward W. Said).<br /><br />",

          "title": "The Drones Club",
          "description": "The Drones Club is in Mayfair, London, located in Dover Street, off Piccadilly. A drone being a male bee that does no work, living off the labour of others, it aptly describes the contemporary Edwardian stereotype of rich, idle young club members. At the same time, though, it should be pointed out that many prominent members do have useful occupations. Pongo Twistleton, for example, is reading for the Bar, and other members are mentioned as holding down jobs.\n    \n    Wodehouse based the Drones Club on a combination of three real London clubs: the Bachelors' Club (existed around the turn of the century), then mostly Buck's Club (established 1919), and a dash of the Bath Club for its swimming pool's ropes and rings. The fictional Drones barman, McGarry, has the same surname as the Buck's first bartender, a Mr McGarry (Buck's barman from 1919 to 1941, credited with creating the Buck's Fizz and Sidecar cocktails). However Evelyn Waugh declared that the Drones did not resemble any real club in 1920s London.[1][2]\n    \n    A real club has been based at 40 Dover Street since 1893, The Arts Club. Other gentlemen's clubs which have existed on Dover Street, but are now dissolved, include the Bath Club, the Junior Naval and Military Club, and the Scottish Club, as well as two mixed-sex clubs, the Albemarle Club and the Empress Club. None of these were ever considered among London's 'premier' clubs of the kind found on St James' Street and Pall Mall, and so their ambience often had something of the raucous informality of the fictional Drones Club.\n    \n    About a dozen club members are major or secondary recurring characters in the Wodehouse stories. In addition to Bertie Wooster (Jeeves stories), Pongo Twistleton (Uncle Fred stories), Rupert Psmith (Psmith stories), and Freddie Threepwood (Blandings stories), prominent recurring drones include Bingo Little and Freddie Widgeon, plus Monty Bodkin, Barmy Fotheringay-Phipps, Tuppy Glossop, Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright, Archibald Mulliner, and the club millionaire Oofy Prosser.",

There he runs afoul of Philip Lentz, an outspoken cognitive neurologist intent upon modeling the human brain by means of computer-based neural networks. Lentz involves Powers in an outlandish and irresistible project: to train a neural net on a canonical list of Great Books. Through repeated tutorials, the device grows gradually more worldly, until it demands to know its own name, sex, race, and reason for exisiting.<br /></div>",

    "description": "Christopher John Francis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7,057. He relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions. He cannot stand to be touched. Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, Christopher is autistic. Everyday interactions and admonishments have little meaning for him. Routine, order and predictability shelter him from the messy, wider world. Then, at fifteen, Christopher\u2019s carefully constructed world falls apart when he finds his neighbor\u2019s dog, Wellington, impaled on a garden fork, and he is initially blamed for the killing. <br /><br />Christopher decides that he will track down the real killer and turns to his favorite fictional character, the impeccably logical Sherlock Holmes, for inspiration. But the investigation leads him down some unexpected paths and ultimately brings him face to face with the dissolution of his parents\u2019 marriage. As he tries to deal with the crisis within his own family, we are drawn into the workings of Christopher\u2019s mind.<br /><br />And herein lies the key to the brilliance of Mark Haddon\u2019s choice of narrator: The most wrenching of emotional moments are chronicled by a boy who cannot fathom emotion. The effect is dazzling, making for a novel that is deeply funny, poignant, and fascinating in its portrayal of a person whose curse and blessing is a mind that perceives the world literally<i>.<br /><br />The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Tim</i>e is one of the freshest debuts in years: a comedy, a heartbreaker, a mystery story, a novel of exceptional literary merit that is great fun to read.",

    "description": "\"I don't have two lives,\" Annie Leibovitz writes in the Introduction to this collection of her work from 1990--2005. \"This is one life, and the personal pictures and the assignment work are all part of it.\" Portraits of well-known figures-Johnny Cash, Nicole Kidman, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Keith Richards, Michael Jordan, Joan Didion, R2-D2, Patti Smith, Nelson Mandela, Jack Nicholson, William Burroughs, George W. Bush with members of his Cabinet-appear alongside pictures of Leibovitz's family and friends, reportage from the siege of Sarajevo in the early Nineties, and landscapes made even more indelible through Leibovitz's discerning eye. The images form a narrative rich in contrasts and continuities: The photographer has a long relationship that ends with illness and death. She chronicles the celebrations and heartbreaks of her large and robust family. She has children of her own. All the while she is working, and the public work resonates with the themes of her life.",

    "description": "This daily digest of intellectual challenge and learning will arouse curiosity, refresh knowledge, expand horizons, and keep the mind sharp<br /><br />Millions of Americans keep bedside books of prayer and meditative reflection\u2014collections of daily passages to stimulate spiritual thought and advancement. The Intellectual Devotional is a secular version of the same\u2014a collection of 365 short lessons that will inspire and invigorate the reader every day of the year. Each daily digest of wisdom is drawn from one of seven fields of knowledge: history, literature, philosophy, mathematics and science, religion, fine arts, and music.<br /><br />Impress your friends by explaining Plato's Cave Allegory, pepper your cocktail party conversation with opera terms, and unlock the mystery of how batteries work. Daily readings range from important passages in literature to basic principles of physics, from pivotal events in history to images of famous paintings with accompanying analysis. The book's goal is to refresh knowledge we've forgotten, make new discoveries, and exercise modes of thinking that are ordinarily neglected once our school days are behind us. Offering an escape from the daily grind to contemplate higher things, The Intellectual Devotional is a great way to awaken in the morning or to revitalize one's mind before retiring in the evening.",

What if a mysterious tribe in the Amazon rainforest turn out to be the most boring people on the earth? What if the afterlife is nothing more than a London suburb, where the dead get new flats, new jobs, and their own telephone directory? These are the sort of truths that emerge in this collection of stories by one of England's most gifted writers.<br /><br />In <b>The Quantity Theory of Insanity</b>, Will Self tips over the banal surfaces of everyday existence to uncover the hideous, the hilarious, and the bizarre. Psychiatry, anthropology, theology--and literature--will never be the same.",

    "description": "<b>\n  <i>A sly, witty, and beautifully orchestrated tale about the difficulty of being good</i>\n</b><br /><br />Edward Baltram is overwhelmed with guilt. His nasty little prank has gone horribly wrong: he has fed his closest friend a sandwich laced with a hallucinogenic drug and the young man has fallen out of a window to his death. Consumed with guilt, Edward experiences a debilitating crisis of conscience. While Edward torments himself for not being good, his stepbrother, Stuart, a brilliant mathematics student, quits his promising scholastic career to live like a monk, devoting himself to the difficult task of becoming good. As Stuart seeks salvation, Edward searches for redemption through a reunion with his famous father, the reclusive painter Jesse Baltram. Funny and compelling, <i>The Good Apprentice</i>, first published in 1986*, is at once a supremely sophisticated entertainment and an inquiry into the spiritual crises that afflict the modern world.<br /><br />*First published in the United States of America by Viking Penguin Inc. 1986",

    "description": "Be careful what you wish for, his mother used to say. Yet how many times, in his twenty years defending the underclass, has Monty Collins wished for a client who is intelligent, articulate and tattoo-free? Now he has one, but it\u2019s not long before his mother\u2019s warning comes back to haunt him. Father Brennan Burke was born in Ireland, raised in New York, educated in Rome \u2014 he\u2019s equally fluent in Latin and the language of the street. And he is the prime suspect in the killing of a foxy young girl whose body was found carved with a religious sign, a sign that points straight to the priest. From their first meeting, Monty finds Burke acerbic, arrogant, and evasive about his relationship with the victim. Conflict between lawyer and client simmers all through the ordeal that lies ahead, as evidence piles up and murder charges seem inevitable. With Burke remaining tight-lipped about his past, Monty has no choice but to go behind his back and conduct a probe into the life of his own client. Never in his career has Monty been so lost for answers, until a long-forgotten incident takes on new and ominous meaning . . .",

She\u2019s made a mistake so huge, it\u2019ll wreck any chance of a partnership. <br /><br />Going into utter meltdown, she walks out of her London office, gets on a train, and ends up in the middle of nowhere. Asking for directions at a big, beautiful house, she\u2019s mistaken for an interviewee and finds herself being offered a job as housekeeper. Her employers have no idea they\u2019ve hired a lawyer\u2013and Samantha has no idea how to work the oven. She can\u2019t sew on a button, bake a potato, or get the #@%# ironing board to open. How she takes a deep breath and begins to cope\u2013and finds love\u2013is a story as delicious as the bread she learns to bake. <br /><br />But will her old life ever catch up with her? And if it does\u2026will she want it back?",

When his father is killed in the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Centre, Oskar sets out to solve the mystery of a key he discovers in his father's closet. It is a search which leads him into the lives of strangers, through the five boroughs of New York, into history, to the bombings of Dresden and Hiroshima, and on an inward journey which brings him ever closer to some kind of peace.",

    "description": "\"I was born twice: first, as a baby girl, on a remarkably smogless Detroit day of January 1960; and then again, as a teenage boy, in an emergency room near Petoskey, Michigan, in August of 1974. . . My birth certificate lists my name as Calliope Helen Stephanides. My most recent driver-s license...records my first name simply as Cal.\" So begins the breathtaking story of Calliope Stephanides and three generations of the Greek-American Stephanides family who travel from a tiny village overlooking Mount Olympus in Asia Minor to Prohibition-era Detroit, witnessing its glory days as the Motor City, and the race riots of l967, before they move out to the tree-lined streets of suburban Grosse Pointe, Michigan. To understand why Calliope is not like other girls, she has to uncover a guilty family secret and the astonishing genetic history that turns Callie into Cal, one of the most audacious and wondrous narrators in contemporary fiction. Lyrical and thrilling, Middlesex is an exhilarating reinvention of the American epic.",

    "description": "This book invites\u2014no, demands\u2014a response from its readers. It is impossible not to be drawn in to the provocative (often contentious) discussion that Harvey Mansfield sets before us. This is the first comprehensive study of manliness, a quality both bad and good, mostly male, often intolerant, irrational, and ambitious. Our \u201cgender-neutral society\u201d does not like it but cannot get rid of it.<br />Drawing from science, literature, and philosophy, Mansfield examines the layers of manliness, from vulgar aggression, to assertive manliness, to manliness as virtue, and to philosophical manliness. He shows that manliness seeks and welcomes drama, prefers times of war, conflict, and risk, and brings change or restores order at crucial moments. Manly men in their assertiveness raise issues, bring them to the fore, and make them public and political\u2014as for example, the manliness of the women\u2019s movement.<br />After a wide-ranging tour from stereotypes to Hemingway and Achilles, to Nietzsche, to feminism, and to Plato, the author returns to today\u2019s problem of \u201cunemployed manliness.\u201d Formulating a reasoned defense of a quality hardly obedient to reason, he urges men, and especially women, to understand and accept manliness, and to give it honest and honorable employment.",

It includes a new discussion of the Third Analogy, a greatly expanded discussion of Kant\u2019s Paralogisms, and entirely new chapters dealing with Kant\u2019s theory of reason, his treatment of theology, and the important Appendix to the Dialectic.<br /><br /><i>Praise for the earlier edition:</i><br /><br />\u201cProbably the most comprehensive and substantial study of the Critique of Pure Reason written by any American philosopher.... This is a splendid book.\u201d \u2014Lewis White Beck<br /><br />\u201cThis masterful study ... will most certainly join the canon of required reading for future interpreters of Kant\u2019s theoretical philosophy. Superbly organized and lucidly written.\u201d \u2014Garrett Green, Journal of Religion",

A holiday, and a novel, no reader will ever forget\u2014at once hilarious, harrowing, surprising, and profound.<br /><br />With The Sportswriter, in 1986, Richard Ford commenced a cycle of novels that ten years later\u2014after Independence Day won both the Pulitzer Prize and the PEN/Faulkner Award\u2014was hailed by The Times of London as \u201can extraordinary epic [that] is nothing less than the story of the twentieth century itself.\u201d Now, a decade later, Frank Bascombe returns, with a new lease on life (and real estate), more acutely in thrall to life\u2019s endless complexities than ever before.<br /><br />Frank's story resumes in the autumn of 2000, when his trade as a realtor on the Jersey Shore is thriving, permitting him to revel in the acceptance of \u201cthat long, stretching-out time when my dreams would have mystery like any ordinary person\u2019s; when whatever I do or say, who I marry, how my kids turn out, becomes what the world\u2014if it makes note at all\u2014knows of me, how I\u2019m seen, understood, even how I think of myself before whatever there is that\u2019s wild and unassuagable rises and cheerlessly hauls me off to oblivion.\u201d But as a Presidential election hangs in the balance, and a postnuclear-family Thanksgiving looms before him along with crises both marital and medical, Frank discovers that what he terms the Permanent Period is fraught with unforeseen perils: \u201cAll the ways that life feels like life at age fifty-five were strewn around me like poppies.\u201d<br /><br />A holiday, and a novel, no reader will ever forget\u2014at once hilarious, harrowing, surprising, and profound. The Lay of the Land is astonishing in its own right and a magnificent expansion of one of the most celebrated chronicles of our time.",

    "description": "Born into the twin shadows of a famous mother and older sister, Lorna Luft was always referred to as Judy Garland's \"other daughter\". But the little girl who first performed \"Jingle Bells\" at the tender age of four on stage with her mother was blessed with her own talent, zest for living, and knack for survival. This is the first insider portrait of one of Hollywood's most celebrated families-- and a remarkably intimate and loving chronicle of an astonishing childhood and a struggle to overcome a legacy of fame and self-destructive behavior. The question follows her to this day: \"What's it like to be Dorothy's daughter?\" Although by appearances glamorous and at times truly thrilling, growing up as the daughter of Judy Garland and producer Sid Luft was anything but a journey over the rainbow. With unsparing candor, Lorna Luft reveals a rare story of a little girl, her half-sister Liza Minnelli, and baby brother trying desperately to hang on to the mother whose life seemed destined to burn brightly but briefly. A beautiful and brilliant performer, Judy was a warm and funny woman who loved her children unconditionally-- but she was also the victim of a powerful dependence on alcohol and prescription drugs, which eventually claimed her life.<br /><br />Now her daughter, Lorna, makes an extraordinary journey back into the spiral of love, addiction, pain, and loss that lurked behind a charmed facade. Filled with behind-the-scenes dramas, hilarious untold stories, and little-known details of Garland family life, it is a tribute to Lorna's victory over her own past. The proud mother of two children, she has at last laid the groundwork that enables her to share the tale only she could tell, unveiling the intensely personal side of life as Judy Garland's daughter.<br /><br />Ultimately a story of forgiveness and hope, of love and its limitations, \"Me And My Shadows\" is a deeply moving testament to the healing powers of embracing one's past, facing one's demons, and charting a course of self-love and discovery.",

    "description": "Set in 1885, <b>The Ox-Bow Incident</b> is a searing and realistic portrait of frontier life and mob violence in the American West. First published in 1940, it focuses on the lynching of three innocent men and the tragedy that ensues when law and order are abandoned. The result is an emotionally powerful, vivid, and unforgettable re-creation of the Western novel, which Clark transmuted into a universal story about good and evil, individual and community, justice and human nature. As Wallace Stegner writes, [Clark's] theme was civilization, and he recorded, indelibly, its first steps in a new country.",

    "description": "The debut novel from the PEN/Faulkner Award Winning Author of The Buddha in the Attic<br /><br />On a sunny day in Berkeley, California, in 1942, a woman sees a sign in a post office window, returns to her home, and matter-of-factly begins to pack her family's possessions. Like thousands of other Japanese Americans they have been reclassified, virtually overnight, as enemy aliens and are about to be uprooted from their home and sent to a dusty internment camp in the Utah desert. <br /><br />In this lean and devastatingly evocative first novel, Julie Otsuka tells their story from five flawlessly realized points of view and conveys the exact emotional texture of their experience: the thin-walled barracks and barbed-wire fences, the omnipresent fear and loneliness, the unheralded feats of heroism. When the Emperor Was Divine is a work of enormous power that makes a shameful episode of our history as immediate as today's headlines.",

Instead, he\u2019s surfing the real estate listings, searching for a sanctuary\u2014a nice farmhouse in Kansas, perhaps. Although James lives in twenty-first-century Manhattan, he\u2019s more at home in the faraway worlds of Eric Rohmer or Anthony Trollope\u2014or his favorite writer, the obscure and tragic Denton Welch. James\u2019s sense of dislocation is exacerbated by his willfully self-absorbed parents, a disdainful sister, his Teutonically cryptic shrink, and an increasingly vague, D-list celebrity grandmother. Compounding matters is James\u2019s growing infatuation with a handsome male colleague at the art gallery his mother owns, where James supposedly works at his summer job but where he actually plots his escape to the prairie.",

You could be experiencing unexplained weight gain...fatigue...mood swings...loss of libido...fibroids...tender or lumpy breasts...endometriosis...PMS...infertility...memory loss...migraines...very heavy or light periods...cold hands and feet...or a combination of these symptoms. You may have been told they're \"nothing,\" or stress, or even menopause-and offered surgery, antidepressants, or prescription hormones. But the startling truth is that you may be suffering from premenopause syndrome-and there are simple, safe solutions. When John Lee wrote the groundbreaking What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Menopause, younger women started asking if natural progesterone could help them, too. In this book Dr. Lee, with women's health expert Jesse Hanley, M.D., brings you a revolutionary nonprescription \"Balance Program\" to restore your gynecological health, energy, and sex drive-and even slow the aging process before menopause, and beyond.",

His sanity. His life.<br /><br />Because Cat is no longer a bodyguard . . .<br /><br />He's bait.",

Perhaps this stranger who has seen death face to face can teach her to live without fear. When she finds him, he is her opposite, a burning man whose breath can boil water and whose touch scorches. As an obsessive love affair begins between them, both are forced to hide their most dangerous secrets\u2014what turned one to ice and the other to fire.<br /><br />A magical story of passion, loss, and renewal, <i>The Ice Queen</i> is Alice Hoffman at her electrifying best.",

Gillian and Sally have endured that fate as well: as children, the sisters were forever outsiders, taunted, talked about, pointed at. Their elderly aunts almost seemed to encourage the whispers of witchery, with their musty house and their exotic concoctions and their crowd of black cats. But all Gillian and Sally wanted was to escape. <br /><br />One will do so by marrying, the other by running away. But the bonds they share will bring them back\u2014almost as if by magic...<br />",

    "description": "<b>Winner of the 1997 James Laughlin Award of The Academy of American Poets</b><br /><br />In his second collection of poems, Hoagland's generous effervescence and a jujitsu cleverness sparkle through line after line confronting negotiation and compromise, gender and culture, sex and rock music, sons and lovers, truth and beauty, and so forth. From the boy who speaks only in \"Kung Fu\" dialogue to the guy who visits a lesbian bar and sees his mother, this often funny and always thoughtful book of poems offers fresh, surprisingly frank meditations on the credentials for contemporary manhood.<br />",

    "description": "Octavio Paz has long been acknowledged as Mexico's foremost writer and critic. In this international classic, Paz has written one of the most enduring and powerful works ever created on Mexico and its people, character, and culture. Compared to Ortega y Gasset's The Revolt of the Masses for its trenchant analysis, this collection contains his most famous work, \"The Labyrinth of Solitude,\" a beautifully written and deeply felt discourse on Mexico's quest for identity that gives us an unequalled look at the country hidden behind \"the mask.\" Also included are \"The Other Mexico,\" \"Return to the Labyrinth of Solitude,\" \"Mexico and the United States,\" and \"The Philanthropic Ogre,\" all of which develop the themes of the title essay and extend his penetrating commentary to the United States and Latin America.",

Carolyn Burke, a biographer and art critic, here reveals how the muse who inspired Man Ray, Cocteau, and Picasso could be the same person who unflinchingly photographed the horrors of Buchenwald and Dachau. Burke captures all the verve and energy of Miller\u2019s life: from her early childhood trauma to her stint as a <i>Vogue</i> model and art-world ing\u00e9nue, from her harrowing years as a war correspondent to her unconventional marriages and passion for gourmet cooking. A lavishly illustrated story of art and beauty, sex and power, Modernism and Surrealism, <i>Lee Miller </i>illuminates an astonishing woman\u2019s journey from art object to artist.",

    "description": "<i>I'm still here, still arriving at the White House in the wee hours of the morning, reading the papers and checking the wire, still waiting for the morning briefing, still sitting down to write the first story of the day and still waiting to ask the tough questions.</i><br /><br />From the woman who has reported on every president from Kennedy to Clinton for United Press International: a unique glimpse into the White House -- and a telling record of the ever-changing relationship between the presidency and the press. <br />From her earliest years, Helen Thomas wanted to be a reporter. Raised in Depression-era Detroit, she worked her way to Washington after college and, unlike other women reporters who gave up their jobs to returning veterans, parlayed her copy-aide job at the <i>Washington Daily News</i> into a twelve-year stint as a radio news writer for UPI, covering such beats as the Department of Justice and other federal agencies.<br /><br />Assigned to the White House press corps in 1961, Thomas was the first woman to close a press conference with \"Thank you, Mr. President,\" and has covered every administration since Kennedy's. Along the way, she was among the pioneers who broke down barriers against women in the national media, becoming the first female president of the White House Correspondents Association, the first female officer of the National Press Club and the first woman member, later president, of the Gridiron Club.<br /><br />In this revealing memoir, which includes hundreds of anecdotes, insights, observations, and personal details, Thomas looks back at a career spent with presidents at home and abroad, on the ground and in the air. She evaluates the enormous changes that Watergate brought, including diminished press access to the Oval Office, and how they have affected every president since Nixon. Providing a unique view of the past four decades of presidential history, Front Row at the White House offers a seasoned study of the relationship between the chief executive officer and the press -- a relationship that is sometimes uneasy, sometimes playful, yet always integral to democracy. <br /><br /><i>Soon enough there will be another president, another first lady, another press secretary and a whole new administration to discover. I'm looking forward to it -- although I'm sure whoever ends up in the Oval Office in a new century may not be so thrilled about the prospect.</i>",

It is the best-selling account of the martyrdom of Jim Elliot and four other missionaries at the hands of the Huaorani Indians in Ecuador.<br /><br />Shadow of the Almighty has inspired Christians since its first publication in 1958. Elisabeth Elliot makes full use of Jim's revealing diaries to fill in the details of a life completely committed to God's service.<br /><br />This story was reintroduced to today's audiences in 2006 thanks to the release of the film, End of the Spear, which tells for the first time the killings from the perspective of the Huaorani.",

    "description": "The Fortunes &amp; Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders (aka Moll Flanders) is a novel by Daniel Defoe, 1st published in 1722. It purports to be the true account of the life of the eponymous Moll, detailing her exploits from birth until old age.<br /> By 1721, Defoe had become a recognised novelist, with the success of Robinson Crusoe in 1719. His political work was tapering off at this point, due to the fall of both Whig &amp; Tory party leaders with whom he had been associated; Robert Walpole was beginning his rise. Defoe was never fully at home with the Walpole group. Defoe's Whig views are nevertheless evident in the story of Moll. The novel's full title gives some insight into this &amp; the outline of the plot: \"The Fortunes &amp; Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders, &amp;c. Who was Born in Newgate, &amp; during a Life of continu'd Variety for Threescore Years, besides her Childhood, was Twelve Year a Whore, five times a Wife (whereof once to her own Brother), Twelve Year a Thief, Eight Year a Transported Felon in Virginia, at last grew Rich, liv'd Honest, &amp; died a Penitent. Written from her own Memorandums.\"",

    "description": "In the 1990s reported autism cases among American children began spiking, from about 1 in 10,000 in 1987 to a shocking 1 in 166 today. This trend coincided with the addition of several new shots to the nation's already crowded vaccination schedule, grouped together and given soon after birth or in the early months of infancy. Most of these shots contained a little-known preservative called thimerosal, which includes a quantity of the toxin mercury.<br /><br /><i>Evidence of Harm</i> explores the heated controversy over what many parents, physicians, public officials, and educators have called an \"epidemic\" of afflicted children. Following several families, David Kirby traces their struggle to understand how and why their once-healthy kids rapidly descended into silence or disturbed behavior, often accompanied by severe physical illness. Alarmed by the levels of mercury in the vaccine schedule, these families sought answers from their doctors, from science, from pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines, and finally from the Center for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration-to no avail. But as they dug deeper, the families also found powerful allies in Congress and in the small community of physicians and researchers who believe that the rise of autism and other disorders is linked to toxic levels of mercury that accumulate in the systems of some children.<br /><br />An important and troubling book, <i>Evidence of Harm</i> reveals both the public and unsung obstacles faced by desperate families who have been opposed by the combined power of the federal government, health agencies, and pharmaceutical giants. From closed meetings of the FDA, CDC, and drug companies, to the mysterious rider inserted into the 2002 Homeland Security Bill that would bar thimerosal litigation, to open hearings held by Congress, this book shows a medical establishment determined to deny \"evidence of harm\" that might be connected with thimerosal and mercury in vaccines. In the end, as research is beginning to demonstrate, the questions raised by these families have significant implications for all children, and for those entrusted to oversee our national health.<br />",

    "description": "It is five years after the events of <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. The fragile New Republic reels from the attacks of Grand Admiral Thrawn, who has not only rallied the remaining Imperial forces, but has driven the rebels back with an abominable new technology: clone soldiers.<br /><br />Hopes are dim as Thrawn mounts a final siege against the Republic. While Han and Chewbacca struggle to form a wary alliance of smugglers in a last-ditch attack against the Empire, Leia keeps the Alliance together and prepares for the birth of her Jedi twins. But the Empire has too many ships and too many clones to combat. The Republic's only hope lies in sending a small force, led by Luke, into the very stronghold that houses Thrawn's terrible cloning machines.<br /><br />There a final danger awaits. The Dark Jedi C'baoth schemes in his secret fortress, directing the battle against the rebels, nursing his insanity, and building his strength to finish what he had already started\u2014the destruction of Luke Skywalker.<br /><br />An odyssey of fast-paced action, stunning revelation, and final confrontation, <i>The Last Command</i> spans a galaxy in flames\u2014a tale that will conclude in this third and last installment as Good and Evil battle \"a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away\u2026\"",

    "description": "Very few books on dating have stood the test of time like Passion and Purity. Its much-needed message remains strong and hopeful in an age when doing whatever \"feels right\" is common practice. Using her own life as an example, Elisabeth Elliot guides singles of both genders and of any age on how to put their love lives under the authority of Jesus Christ.<br />\tPassion and Purity covers dating issues such as: <br />-how to know which person is the right one to marry<br />-loving passionately while remaining sexually pure<br />-the man's and woman's role in relationships<br />-putting God's desires ahead of personal desires<br />-how far is too far, physically<br /><br />\tThis best-selling book now has a new cover, an updated interior design, and a foreword from popular author Joshua Harris. Quest for Love will be redesigned in a similar manner to help readers identify the books as a pair. While Passion and Purity shares the love story of Elisabeth and Jim, Quest for Love is a compilation of stories on how other men and women discovered love through God's direction. Together, these two remarkable books accentuate our need to commit daily to Christ all matters of the heart and to wait on his timing.",

Having just completed his masterpiece, The General Theory of Relativity\u2014which provided a brand-new theory of gravity and promised a new perspective on the cosmos as a whole\u2014he set out at once to share his excitement with as wide a public as possible in this popular and accessible book.<br /><br />Here published for the first time as a Penguin Classic, this edition of <i>Relativity </i>features a new introduction by bestselling science author Nigel Calder.<br /><br />For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700\u00a0titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Sure it's not the perfect job, but if it helps her reach her goal -- and gets her younger sister through college at the same time, Alayna will work for the devil himself -- namely Ben \"Ice Man\" Richards, the firm's arrogant, brilliant, insufferable, and unpredictable rising star.As long as Richards curbs his famous rudeness and treats her with respect, Alayna should be able to cope. But there's more to Ice Man than meets the eye, a fire smoldering beneath his hard, cool surface. And when personal disaster threatens, Alayna finds herself unlocking the doors of her private life to the last man she ever dreamed she'd let enter. And once inside, he may just alter Alayna's world and her outlook in glorious, frightening ways.",

Soon, they suspect they are guinea pigs in a bizarre social experiment and that their only hope of escape is to break through a dangerous threshold of time and space.

    "description": "Conceived originally as a serious presentation of\u00a0the development of philosophy for Catholic seminary students, Frederick Copleston's nine-volume\u00a0<i>A History Of Philosophy</i> has\u00a0journeyed far beyond the modest purpose of its author to universal acclaim as the best history of\u00a0philosophy in English.<br /><br />Copleston, an Oxford Jesuit\u00a0of immense erudition who once tangled with A. J. Ayer in a fabled debate about the existence of God\u00a0and the possibility of metaphysics, knew that\u00a0seminary students were fed a woefully inadequate diet\u00a0of theses and proofs, and that their familiarity\u00a0with most of history's great thinkers was reduced\u00a0to simplistic caricatures. Copleston set out to\u00a0redress the wrong by writing a complete history of\u00a0Western philosophy, one crackling with incident and\u00a0intellectual excitement -- and one that gives full\u00a0place to each thinker, presenting his thought in a\u00a0beautifully rounded manner and showing his links\u00a0to those who went before and to those who came\u00a0after him. <br /><br />The result of Copleston's prodigious labors is a history of philosophy that is unlikely ever to be surpassed. <i>Thought</i> magazine summed up the general agreement among scholars and students alike when it reviewed Copleston's <i>A History of Philosophy</i> as \"broad-minded and objective, comprehensive and scholarly, unified and well proportioned... We cannot recommend [it] too highly.\"",

    "description": "William Osler, who was a brilliant, innovative teacher and a scholar of the natural history of disease, revolutionized the art of practicing medicine at the bedside of his patients. He was idolized by two generations of medical students and practitioners for whom he came to personify the ideal doctor. But much more than a physician, Osler was a fiercely intelligent humanist.<br />In both his writings and his personal life--and through the prism of the tragedy of the Great War--he embodied the art of living. Indeed, this is a book not only about the evolution of modern medicine, the training of doctors, holism in medical thought, and the doctor-patient relationship, but also about humanism, Victorianism, the Great War, and much else. Meticulously researched and accessibly written, <em>William Osler: A Life in Medicine</em> brings to life both a fascinating man and the formative age of twentieth-century medicine.<br />",

It is the family story of Celia del Pino, and her husband, daughter and grandchildren, from the mid-1930s to 1980. Celia's story mirrors the magical realism of Cuba itself, a country of beauty and poverty, idealism and corruption. DREAMING IN CUBAN presents a unique vision and a haunting lamentation for a past that might have been.",

Lying pols.<br /><br />Just a few of the snares lying in wait for the reporters who covered the 1972 presidential election. Traveling with the press pack from the June primaries to the big night in November, Rolling Stone reporter Timothy Crouse hopscotched the country with both the Nixon and McGovern campaigns and witnessed the birth of modern campaign journalism. The Boys on the Bus is the raucous story of how American news got to be what it is today. With its verve, wit, and psychological acumen, it is a classic of American reporting.",

    "description": "<b>FROM AUTHOR OF <i>THE NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER, <i>BEHAVE</i></b><br /><br /><b>'Remarkable... <i>A Primate's Memoir</i> is the closest the baboon is likely to come - and it's plenty close enough - to having its own <i>Iliad' The New York Times Review of Books</i></b><br /><br /><b>'One of the best scientist-writers of our time' Oliver Sacks</b><br /><br />Brooklyn-born Robert Sapolsky grew up wishing he could live in the primate diorama in the Museum of Natural History. At school he wrote fan letters to primatologists and even taught himself Swahili, all with the hope of one day joining his primate brethren in Africa. But when, at the age of twenty-one, Sapolky's dream finally comes true he discovers that the African bush bears little resemblance to the tranquillity of a museum.<br /><br />This is the story of the next twenty-one years as Sapolsky slowly infiltrates and befriends a troop of Savannah baboons. Alone in the middle of the Serengeti with no electricity, running water or telephone, and surviving countless scams, culinary atrocities and a surreal kidnapping, Sapolsky becomes ever more enamoured with his adopted baboon troop - unique and compelling characters in their own right - and he returns to them summer after summer, until tragedy finally prevails.<br /><br />Exhilarating, hilarious and poignant, <i>A Primate's Memoir</i> is a uniquely honest window into the coming-of-age of one of our greatest scientific minds.",

    "description": "Patty Murphy is facing that pivotal point in a woman's life when her biological clock ticks as insistently as a beating heart. Will she find Mr Right and start a family? But Patty is in love - with a man who is not only attractive and financially sound, but sensitive and warmhearted. There's just one small problem: He is also gay. Against her better judgment, and pleas from family and friends, Patty refuses to give up on Ethan. Every man she dates ultimately leaves her aching for the gentle comfort and intimacy she shares with him. But even as she throws eligible bachelors to the wayside to spend yet another platonic night with Ethan, Patty longs more and more for the consolation of loving and being loved. In the meantime she must content herself with waiting - until the real thing comes along . . .",

With a foreword by Billy Graham and now repackaged for a new generation of readers, <i>The Master Plan of Evangelism</i> will show every Christian how to minister to the people God brings into their lives.<br /><br />Instead of drawing on the latest popular fad or the newest selling technique, Robert E. Coleman looks to the Bible to find the answer to the question, What was Christ's strategy for evangelism? Through a thorough examination of the gospel accounts, Coleman points out unchanging, simple, yet profound biblical principles of how to emulate Christ to others.",

    "description": "Contemporary reporter Sam Fowler, stuck in a dull job and a failing marriage, abruptly finds himself transported back to the summer of 1869. After a wrenching period of adjustment, he comes to feel rejuvenated by his involvement with the nation's first pro baseball players. He also finds his senses quickening and tastes changing as he faces life-threatening 19th-century challenges on and off the baseball diamond. Through his attachments to the ballplayers and the lovely Caitlin O'Neill, he might just regain the sense of family he desperately needs. Darryl Brock masterfully evokes post-Civil War America's smoky, turbulent cities, the new transcontinental railroad that takes passengers over prairies and mountains to California, the dance halls and parlor houses, the financial booms and busts, and historical luminaries like Mark Twain and Jesse James. Equally appealing to sports fans and anyone who likes a good read, If I Never Get Back well deserves the Cleveland Plain Dealer's judgment that it \"hits a home run.\"",

In renowned author Elizabeth Berg\u2019s moving new novel, unearthed truths force one seemingly ordinary family to reexamine their disparate lives and to ask themselves: Is it too late to mend the hurts of the past?<br /><br />Laura Bartone anticipates her annual family reunion in Minnesota with a mixture of excitement and wariness. Yet this year\u2019s gathering will prove to be much more trying than either she or her siblings imagined. As soon as she arrives, Laura realizes that something is not right with her sister. Forever wrapped up in events of long ago, Caroline is the family\u2019s restless black sheep. When Caroline confronts Laura and their brother, Steve, with devastating allegations about their mother, the three have a difficult time reconciling their varying experiences in the same house. But a sudden misfortune will lead them all to face the past, their own culpability, and their common need for love and forgiveness.<br /><br />Readers have come to love Elizabeth Berg for the \u201clucent beauty of [her] prose, the verity of her insights, and the tenderness of her regard for her fellow human\u201d (<i>Booklist</i>).

    "description": "Remember Jesus Christ? Although it seems almost too obvious, the center of our faith is surprisingly easy to forget. Dynamic pastor C.J. Mahaney shows how to overcome our tendency to move on from the gospel of grace. Finding joy in the gospel -- whose promises allow us to escape condemnation whenever it attacks -- helps us avoid the prevalent trap of legalism. With practical suggestions, Mahaney demonstrates the difference between knowing the gospel... and making it the main thing in daily decisions and daily living.<br /><br /><b>What Are You Centered On? </b><br /><br />Sometimes the most important truths are the easiest to forget. It's time to get back to the starting point of the Christian life--the cross of Christ. Jesus' work on your behalf must be the central motivation for your life and faith--the <i>main thing. </i><br /><br />\"Never move on,\" says C.J. Mahaney, who shows you how to center <i>every</i> day around the cross of Calvary and how to escape the pitfalls of legalism, condemnation, and feelings-driven faith.<br /><br />Tap into the gospel's power and see how a cross centered focus can transform your life today!",

    "description": "While most Christians agree to seek purity and save sex for marriage, few have been given a blueprint for how that should affect their view of dating and love. In <i>I Kissed Dating Goodbye</i>, Joshua Harris exposes the \"Seven Habits of Highly Defective Dating\" and offers a realistic outline of how to have a biblical vision of marriage. Harris contends that one must begin with a new attitude, viewing love, purity, and singleness from God's perspective rather than thinking that love and romance are to be enjoyed \"solely for recreation.\" In such well-named chapters as \"Guarding Your Heart\" and \"What Matters at Fifty,\" Harris encourages the reader to look at one's character rather than reveling in infatuation, to regard love as a truly selfless, biblical act rather than a feeling. He refutes the concept that we are victims of \"falling in love\" (that it is beyond our control), saying that \"God wants us to seek guidance from scriptural truth, not feeling. Smart love looks beyond personal desires and the gratification of the moment. It looks at the big picture: serving others and glorifying God.\" Before you roll your eyes, moaning that this sounds terribly unromantic, know that Harris does a superb job of couching his convictions in the sincere belief that if we are purposeful in our singleness and date with integrity, a fulfilled marriage awaits us--in God's timing. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>",

Although he experienced excruciating anguish and despair, he was still able to keep a journal in which he wrote a spiritual imperative to himself each day that emerged from his conversations with friends and supporters.<br /><br /><br /><br />For more than eight years, Henri Nouwen felt that what he wrote was too raw and private to share with others. Instead, he published <i>The Return of the Prodigal Son,</i> in which he expressed some of the insights gained during his mental and spiritual crisis. But then friends asked him, \"Why keep your anguish hidden from the many people who have been nurtured by your writing? Wouldn't it be of consolation for many to know about the fierce inner battle that lies underneath so many of your spiritual insights?\"<br /><br />For the countless men and women who have to live through the pain of broken relationships, or who suffer from the loss of a loved one, this book about the inner voice of love offers new courage, new hope, even new life.",

    "description": "Lakshmi is a thirteen-year-old girl who lives with her family in a small hut in the mountains of Nepal. Her family is desperately poor, but her life is full of simple pleasures, like raising her black-and-white speckled goat, and having her mother brush her hair by the light of an oil lamp. But when the harsh Himalayan monsoons wash away all that remains of the family\u2019s crops, Lakshmi\u2019s stepfather says she must leave home and take a job to support her family. <br /><br />He introduces her to a glamorous stranger who tells her she will find her a job as a maid working for a wealthy woman in the city. Glad to be able to help, Lakshmi undertakes the long journey to India and arrives at \u201cHappiness House\u201d full of hope. But she soon learns the unthinkable truth: she has been sold into prostitution. <br /><br />An old woman named Mumtaz rules the brothel with cruelty and cunning. She tells Lakshmi that she is trapped there until she can pay off her family\u2019s debt \u2013 then cheats Lakshmi of her meager earnings so that she can never leave. <br /><br />Lakshmi\u2019s life becomes a nightmare from which she cannot escape. Still, she lives by her mother\u2019s words \u2013 \u201cSimply to endure is to triumph\u201d \u2013 and gradually, she forms friendships with the other girls that enable her to survive in this terrifying new world. Then the day comes when she must make a decision \u2013 will she risk everything for a chance to reclaim her life? <br /><br />Written in spare and evocative vignettes, this powerful novel renders a world that is as unimaginable as it is real, and a girl who not only survives but triumphs.",

    "description": "Identity crises, consumerism, and star-crossed teenage love in a futuristic society where people connect to the Internet via feeds implanted in their brains.<br /><br />For Titus and his friends, it started out like any ordinary trip to the moon - a chance to party during spring break and play with some stupid low-grav at the Ricochet Lounge. But that was before the crazy hacker caused all their feeds to malfunction, sending them to the hospital to lie around with nothing inside their heads for days. And it was before Titus met Violet, a beautiful, brainy teenage girl who has decided to fight the feed and its omnipresent ability to categorize human thoughts and desires. Following in the footsteps of George Orwell, Anthony Burgess, and Kurt Vonnegut Jr., M. T. Anderson has created a not-so-brave new world \u2014 and a smart, savage satire that has captivated readers with its view of an imagined future that veers unnervingly close to the here and now.",

Until he blows it. The school bookie says the odds are 12-to-1 against him getting Noah back, but Paul\u2019s not giving up without playing his love really loud. His best friend Joni might be drifting away, his other best friend Tony might be dealing with ultra-religious parents, and his ex-boyfriend Kyle might not be going away anytime soon, but sometimes everything needs to fall apart before it can really fit together right.<br /><br />This is a happy-meaningful romantic comedy about finding love, losing love, and doing what it takes to get love back in a crazy-wonderful world.",

    "description": "Maus is the story of Vladek Spiegelman, a Jewish survivor of Hitler's Europe, and his son, a cartoonist who tries to come to terms with his father, his father's terrifying story, and History itself. Its form, the cartoon, succeeds perfectly in shocking us out of any lingering sense of familiarity with the events described, approaching, as it does, the unspeakable through the diminutive. It is, as the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> has commented, \"a remarkable feat of documentary detail and novelistic vividness...an unfolding literary event.\"<br /><br />Moving back and forth from Poland to Rego Park, New York, <i>Maus</i> tells two powerful stories: the first is Spiegelman's father's account of how he and his wife survived Hitler's Europe, a harrowing tale filled with countless brushes with death, improbable escapes, and the terror of confinement and betrayal. The second is the author's tortured relationship with his aging father as they try to lead a normal life of minor arguments and passing visits against a backdrop of history too large to pacify. At all levels, this is the ultimate survivor's tale - and that, too, of the children who somehow survive even the survivors.<br /><br />Part I of <i>Maus</i> takes Spiegelman's parents to the gates of Auschwitz and him to the edge of despair. Put aside all your preconceptions. These cats and mice are not Tom and Jerry, but something quite different. This is a new kind of literature.",

    "description": "Crime and Punishment (1866) is the story of a murder committed on principle, of a killer who wishes by his action to set himself outside and above society. A novel of great physical and psychological tension, pervaded by Dostoevsky's sinister evocation of St Petersburg, it also has moments of wild humour. Dostoevsky's own harrowing experiences mark the novel. He had himself undergone interrogation and trial, and was condemned to death, a sentence commuted at the last moment to penal servitude. In prison he was particularly impressed by one hardened murderer who seemed to have attained a spiritual equilibrium beyond good and evil: yet witnessing the misery of other convicts also engendered in Dostoevsky a belief in the Christian idea of salvation through suffering.",

    "description": "Andre Blake tells the true story of Chris Gardner, a Milwaukee African-American who escaped from his ex-convict mother and violent stepfather by joining the Navy and then becoming a San Francisco stockbroker, only to wind up as a homeless single father of a 19-month-old son. Read by the street-smart Blake, the story's colorful language and no-holds-barred humor make it captivating. It's a happy-ending morality tale that shows how ironclad determination can break negative cultural cycles and lead to financial and personal rewards. Beleaguered men from all dysfunctional circumstances will be inspired by the well-told story of this authentic American life. Few will forget it once they hear it.

But with boy-crazy Dora Matthews as a tentmate, Jenny is seduced into taking a late night unauthorized hike into the wilderness where -- instead of smoking a clandestine cigarette -- she and Dora stumble upon the body of a murdered Phoenix woman. <br /><br />Knowing that her little girl will be traumatized by her experience, Joanna must balance concern for Jenny with the demands of her new marriage and possible bid for reelection. <br /><br />But when young Dora Matthews herself turns up dead two days later, Joanna\u2032s concern turns to terror. For if Constance Haskell\u2032s killer is murdering potential witnesses, Jenny may be next.",

    "description": "The author writes: The two long pieces in this book originally came out in The New Yorker ? RAISE HIGH THE ROOF BEAM, CARPENTERS in 1955, SEYMOUR ? An Introduction in 1959. Whatever their differences in mood or effect, they are both very much concerned with Seymour Glass, who is the main character in my still-uncompleted series about the Glass family. It struck me that they had better be collected together, if not deliberately paired off, in something of a hurry, if I mean them to avoid unduly or undesirably close contact with new material in the series. There is only my word for it, granted, but I have several new Glass stories coming along ? waxing, dilating ? each in its own way, but I suspect the less said about them, in mixed company, the better. Oddly, the joys and satisfactions of working on the Glass family peculiarly increase and deepen for me with the years. I can't say why, though. Not, at least, outside the casino proper of my fiction.",

So when she was taken prisoner by Sheik Jamal abd Thabit during a raid, she was determined not to succumb to his wishes. She thought it would be easy, for rather than take her as his concubine then and there, Jamal struck a deal\u2014if he was unable to seduce her within four weeks, he would set her free. But Zara was more his slave than she'd thought, for she found herself mesmerized by the virile beauty of his muscular form and, at the slightest touch of his capable hands, felt her body grow hotter than the desert sun. Torn between duty to her people and the temptations of her Arab master, Zara wondered if she dared risk all she had ever known and trust her heart to this enemy.",

    "description": "Ever since Einstein's study of Brownian Motion, scientists have understood that a little disorder can actually make systems more effective. But most people still shun disorder-or suffer guilt over the mess they can't avoid. No longer!With a spectacular array of true stories and case studies of the hidden benefits of mess,A Perfect Mess overturns the accepted wisdom that tight schedules, organization, neatness, and consistency are the keys to success. Drawing on examples from business, parenting, cooking, the war on terrorism, retail, and even the meteoric career of Arnold Schwarzenegger, coauthors Abrahmson and Freedman demonstrate that moderately messy systems use resources more efficiently, yield better solutions, and are harder to break than neat ones.Applying this idea on scales both large (government, society) and small (desktops, garages), A Perfect Mess uncovers all the ways messiness can trump neatness, and will help you assess the right amount of disorder for any system. Whether it's your company's management plan or your hallway closet that bedevils you, this book will show you why to say yes to mess.",

    "description": "The riveting life story of hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina who, as his country was being torn apart by violence during the Rwandan genocide of 1994, sheltered more than 12,000 members of the Tutsi clan and Hutu moderates, while homicidal mobs raged outside with machetes.<br /><br />As his country was being torn apart by violence during the Rwandan genocide of 1994, hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina\u2014the \"Oskar Schindler of Africa\"\u2014refused to bow to the madness that surrounded him. Confronting killers with a combination of diplomacy, flattery, and deception, he offered shelter to more than twelve thousand members of the Tutsi clan and Hutu moderates, while homicidal mobs raged outside with machetes.<br /><br />An Ordinary Man explores what the Academy Award-nominated film Hotel Rwanda could not: the inner life of the man who became one of the most prominent public faces of that terrible conflict. Rusesabagina tells for the first time the full story of his life\u2014growing up as the son of a rural farmer, the child of a mixed marriage, his extraordinary career path which led him to become the first Rwandan manager of the Belgian-owned Hotel Milles Collines\u2014all of which contributed to his heroic actions in the face of such horror. He will also bring the reader inside the hotel for those one hundred terrible days depicted in the film, relating the anguish of those who watched as their loved ones were hacked to pieces and the betrayal that he felt as a result of the UN\u2019s refusal to help at this time of crisis.<br /><br />Including never-before-reported details of the Rwandan genocide, An Ordinary Man is sure to become a classic of tolerance literature, joining such books as Thomas Keneally\u2019s Schindler\u2019s List, Nelson Mandela\u2019s Long Walk to Freedom, and Elie Wiesel\u2019s Night. Paul Rusesabagina\u2019s autobiography is the story of one man who did not let fear get the better of him\u2014a man who found within himself.",

    "description": "<em>A Director Prepares</em> is a thought-provoking examination of the challenges of making theatre. In it, Anne Bogart speaks candidly and with wisdom of the courage required to create 'art with great presence'.<br /> Each chapter tackles one of the seven major areas Bogart has identified as both potential partner and potential obstacle to art-making. They are Violence; Memory; Terror; Eroticism; Stereotype; Embarrassment; and Resistance. Each one can be used to generate extraordinary creative energy, if we know how to use it.<br /><em>A Director Prepares</em> offers every practitioner an extraordinary insight into the creative process. It is a handbook, Bible and manifesto, all in one. No other book on the art of theatre comes even close to offering this much understanding, experience and inspiration.<br />",

On the night before she and her friends part for the summer, Carmen decides to toss them. But Tibby says they're great. She'd love to have them. Lena and Bridget also think they're fabulous. Lena decides that they should all try them on. Whoever they fit best will get them. Nobody knows why, but the pants fit everyone perfectly. Even Carmen (who never thinks she looks good in anything) thinks she looks good in the pants. Over a few bags of cheese puffs, they decide to form a sisterhood and take the vow of the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants . . . the next morning, they say good-bye. And then the journey of the pants -- and the most memorable summer of their lives -- begins. \"From the Hardcover edition.\"",

    "description": "\"Death In Venice\" tells the tragic story of a man who falls into foolish, forbidden love, only to reap his own ruin. While on holiday in Venice, a dignified older gentleman notices a teenage boy playing on the shore. The boy soon comes to represent the sleek perfection of youth, and the older man finds himself overwhelmed and obsessed with this ideal. Rich in imagery, and exploring the themes of beauty and decay, this book is a disturbing yet memorable work. Also included are seven of Mann's short stories, including \"Tristan\", \"The Child Prodigy\", and \"Man and Dog\".",

But this worldly, sarcastic, and perhaps even wicked woman may have been made for something greater than love.<br /><br />In her portrait of Myra and in her exquisitely nuanced depiction of her marriage, Cather shows the evolution of a human spirit as it comes to bridle against the constraints of ordinary happiness and seek an otherworldly fulfillment. <i>My Mortal Enemy</i> is a work whose drama and intensely moral imagination make it unforgettable.",

    "description": "Many young women today consider \"feminism\" a dirty word, an antiquated term that hasn t expanded to accommodate the diverse needs of a new generation. In addition, decades of negative campaigns, excessively \"messaged\" issues, and hanging chads have all combined to make political apathy appear not only smart, but sexy. The result is that while they still bemoan the state of gender politics, gender equity, and the agendas of their local, state, and national politicians, nearly 19 million young women chose not to vote in the last presidential election.<br />Yes, the face of feminism is changing, but to what end? Is a new generation taking for granted the rights hard-won only a generation before? And by focusing on culturalnot electoralpolitics, are young women giving their power away? In this pivotal book, Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, political and environmental consultant (and wife of Washington State s Republican senate majority leader), asks these critical questions, tracing feminism s distinguished past and asking what can be done to protect and further women s rights and freedoms.\"",

    "description": "Since his retirement from the Navajo Tribal Police, Joe Leaphorn has occasionally been enticed to return to work by former colleagues who seek his help when they need to solve a particularly puzzling crime. They ask because Leaphorn, aided by officers Jim Chee and Bernie Manuelito, always delivers.<br /><br />But this time the problem is with an old case of Joe's--his \"last case,\" unsolved, is one that continues to haunt him. And with Chee and Bernie just back from their honeymoon, Leaphorn is pretty much on his own.<br /><br />The original case involved a priceless, one-of-a-kind Navajo rug supposedly destroyed in a fire. Suddenly, what looks like the same rug turns up in a magazine spread. And the man who brings the photo to Leaphorn's attention has gone missing. Leaphorn must pick up the threads of a crime he'd thought impossible to untangle. Not only has the passage of time obscured the details, but it also appears that there's a murderer still on the loose.<br /><br />New York Times bestselling author Tony Hillerman is at the top of his form in this atmospheric and riveting novel set amid the rugged beauty of his beloved Southwest.",

    "description": "When <i>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter</i> was published in 1940, Carson McCullers was instantly recognized as one of the most promising writers of her generation. The novels that followed established her as a master of Southern Gothic.<br /><br /> \"McCullers' gift,\" writes Joyce Carol Oates, \"was to evoke, through an accumulation of images and musically repeated phrases, the singularity of experience, not to pass judgment on it.\" McCullers effortlessly conveyed the raw anguish of her characters and the weird beauty of their perceptions. Set in small Georgia towns that are at once precisely observed and mythically resonant, McCullers' novels explore the strange, sometimes grotesque inner lives of characters who are often marginal and misunderstood. Above all, McCullers possessed an unmatched ability to capture the bewilderment and fragile wonder of adolescence. <br /><br /> In <i>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter</i>, an enigmatic deaf-mute draws out the haunted confessions of an itinerant worker, a young girl, a black doctor, and the widowed owner of a small-town caf\u00e9. Two shorter works, <i>Reflections in a Golden Eye</i> (1941) and <i>The Ballad of the Sad Caf\u00e9</i> (1943), use melodramatic scenarios and freakish characters to explore the disfiguring violence of desire. <i>The Member of the Wedding</i> (1946), on which the play and film were based, tells of a young girl's fascination with her brother's wedding and is perhaps McCullers' most moving and accomplished novel. <i>In Clock Without Hands</i> (1960), the story of a terminally ill druggist, McCullers produces some of her most forceful and indignant social criticism.<br /><br /> Edited by Carlos Dews.",

    "description": "Nobel prize-winning author Yasunari Kawabata is noted for his combination of a traditional Japanese aesthetic with modernist, often surreal trends. In these three tales, superbly translated by Edward Seidensticker, erotic fantasy is underlaid with longing and memories of past loves.<br /><br />In the title story, the protagonist visits a brothel where elderly men spend a chaste but lecherous night with a drugged, unconscious virgin. As he admires the girl's beauty, he recalls his past womanizing, and reflects on the relentless course of old age. <br /><br />In One Arm, a young girl removes her right arm and gives it to the narrator to take home for the night; a surreal seduction follows as he tries to allay its fears, caresses it, and even replaces his own right arm with it.<br /><br />The protagonist of Of Birds and Beasts prefers the company of his pet birds and dogs to people, yet for him all living beings are beautiful objects which, though they give him pleasure, he treats with casual cruelty.<br /><br />Beautiful yet chilling, richly poetic yet subtly disturbing, these stories make compelling reading and reaffirm Kawabata s status as a world-class writer.",

    "description": "Who was Huey Long? He was an extraordinary figure in American political history \u2013 a great natural politician who looked, and often seemed to behave, like a caricature of the redneck Southern politico. Yet, at the time of his death, he had become a serious rival to Franklin Roosevelt for the presidency. In this biography, the first full-scale analysis of Long, this intriguing and incredible man stands wholly revealed and understood.<br /><br />The eminent historian T. Harry Williams has created a work masterly in its scope and detail. This award-winning biography brings fresh life to the sensation-ridden years when Long became a figure of national importance. <i>Huey Long</i> was winner of the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award.",

    "description": "This is a book about young men who learned to play baseball during the 1930s and 1940s, and then went on to play for one of the most exciting major-league ball clubs ever fielded, the team that broke the color barrier with Jackie Robinson. It is a book by and about a sportswriter who grew up near Ebbets Field, and who had the good fortune in the 1950s to cover the Dodgers for the Herald Tribune. This is a book about what happened to Jackie, Carl Erskine, Pee Wee Reese, and the others when their glory days were behind them. In short, it is a book about America, about fathers and sons, prejudice and courage, triumph and disaster, and told with warmth, humor, wit, candor, and love.",

    "description": "To mark the centenary of Wilde's death, the Stratford Festival staged this unique production of the original, complete four-act version of this famous play. This does not replace the three act version, but does give the audience the opportunity to enjoy the play that Wilde originally wrote, with its extra characters, more pointed social commentary, additional scenes and new dialogue. This play remains perhaps Wilde's wittiest and most loved romantic comedy.All Plays are produced at the Glenn Gould Theatre in the CBC Broadcasting Centre. The plays are produced with professional actors, sound effects, and original music in front of a live audience.",

    "description": "Travelling in Europe with her family, Daisy Miller, an exquistely beautiful young American woman, presents her fellow-countryman Winterbourne with a dilemma he cannot resolve. Is she deliberately flouting social conventions in the way she talks and acts, or is she simply ignorant of them? When she strikes up an intimate friendship with an urbane young Italian, her flat refusal to observe the codes of respectable behavior leaves her perilously exposed. In Daisy Miller James created his first great portrait of an enigmatic and independent American woman, a figure who would come to dominate his later masterpieces.",

    "description": "The Education of Little Tree tells of a boy orphaned very young, who is adopted by his Cherokee grandmother and half-Cherokee grandfather in the Appalachian mountains of Tennessee during the Great Depression. Little Tree as his grandparents call him is shown how to hunt and survive in the mountains, to respect nature in the Cherokee Way, taking only what is needed, leaving the rest for nature to run its course. Little Tree also learns the often callous ways of white businessmen and tax collectors, and how Granpa, in hilarious vignettes, scares them away from his illegal attempts to enter the cash economy. Granma teaches Little Tree the joys of reading and education. But when Little Tree is taken away by whites for schooling, we learn of the cruelty meted out to Indian children in an attempt to assimilate them and of Little Tree's perception of the Anglo world and how it differs from the Cherokee Way. A classic of its era, and an enduring book for all ages, The Education of Little Tree has now been redesigned for this twenty-fifth anniversary edition.",

    "description": "A masterful portrait of a tragic crucible in the settlement of the American heartland - the 'Children's Blizzard' of 1888.<br /><br />The gripping story of an epic prairie snowstorm that killed hundreds of newly arrived settlers and cast a shadow on the promise of the American frontier. <br /><br />January 12, 1888, began as an unseasonably warm morning across Nebraska, the Dakotas, and Minnesota, the weather so mild that children walked to school without coats and gloves. But that afternoon, without warning, the atmosphere suddenly, violently changed. One moment the air was calm; the next the sky exploded in a raging chaos of horizontal snow and hurricane-force winds. Temperatures plunged as an unprecedented cold front ripped through the center of the continent. <br /><br />By Friday morning, January 13, some five hundred people lay dead on the drifted prairie, many of them children who had perished on their way home from country schools. In a few terrifying hours, the hopes of the pioneers had been blasted by the bitter realities of their harsh environment. Recent immigrants from Germany, Norway, Denmark, and the Ukraine learned that their free homestead was not a paradise but a hard, unforgiving place governed by natural forces they neither understood nor controlled. <br /><br />With the storm as its dramatic, heartbreaking focal point, The Children's Blizzard captures this pivotal moment in American history by tracing the stories of five families who were forever changed that day. Drawing on family interviews and memoirs, as well as hundreds of contemporary accounts, David Laskin creates an intimate picture of the men, women, and children who made choices they would regret as long as they lived. Here too is a meticulous account of the evolution of the storm and the vain struggle of government forecasters to track its progress. <br /><br />The blizzard of January 12, 1888, is still remembered on the prairie. Children fled that day while their teachers screamed into the relentless roar. Husbands staggered into the blinding wind in search of wives. Fathers collapsed while trying to drag their children to safety. In telling the story of this meteorological catastrophe, the deadliest blizzard ever to hit the prairie states, David Laskin has produced a masterful portrait of a tragic crucible in the settlement of the American heartland.",

    "description": "The study of cinematic style has profoundly shaped our attitude toward movies. Style assigns films to a tradition, distinguishes a classic, and signals the arrival of a pathbreaking innovation. David Bordwell now shows how film scholars have attempted to explain stylistic continuity and change across the history of cinema.<br /><br />Bordwell scrutinizes the theories of style launched by AndrE Bazin, NoEl Burch, and other film historians. In the process he celebrates a century of cinema, integrating discussions of film classics such as <i>The Birth of a Nation</i> and <i>Citizen Kane</i> with analyses of more current box-office successes such as <i>Jaws</i> and <i>The Hunt for Red October</i>. Examining the contributions of both noted and neglected directors, he considers the earliest filmmaking, the accomplishments of the silent era, the development of Hollywood, and the strides taken by European and Asian cinema in recent years.<br /><br /><i>On the History of Film Style</i> proposes that stylistic developments often arise from filmmakers' search for engaging and efficient solutions to production problems. Bordwell traces this activity across history through a detailed discussion of cinematic staging. Illustrated with more than 400 frame enlargements, this wide-ranging study provides a new lens for viewing cinema.",

A calliope's shrill siren song beckons to all with a seductive promise of dreams and youth regained. In this season of dying, Cooger &amp; Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show has come to Green Town, Illinois, to destroy every life touched by its strange and sinister mystery. And two inquisitive boys standing precariously on the brink of adulthood will soon discover the secret of the satanic raree-show's smoke, mazes, and mirrors, as they learn all too well the heavy cost of wishes - and the stuff of nightmare.",

Case in point every time she heads to Costa Rica, she is forced to visit another prison. Although a jail may not be everyone's idea of a place to find a date, Wendy soon falls in love with a man, a country, and its people and risks everything she has to clear his name.",

In this sense, the problem of the twenty-first century remains the problem of the color line. </i> --from the new Preface<br /><br />First published in 1993 on the one-year anniversary of the L.A. riots, <i>Race Matters</i> was a national best-seller, and it has since become a groundbreaking classic on race in America.<br /><br /><i>Race Matters</i> contains West's most powerful essays on the issues relevant to black Americans today: despair, black conservatism, black-Jewish relations, myths about black sexuality, the crisis in leadership in the black community, and the legacy of Malcolm X. And the insights that he brings to these complicated problems remain fresh, exciting, creative, and compassionate. Now more than ever, <i>Race Matters</i> is a book for all Americans, as it helps us to build a genuine multiracial democracy in the new millennium.",

    "description": "A delightfully dishy novel about the all-time most impossible boss in the history of impossible bosses and the basis for the major motion picture starring Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep. <br /><br />Andrea Sachs, a small-town girl fresh out of college, lands the job \u201ca million girls would die for.\u201d Hired as the assistant to Miranda Priestly, the high-profile, fabulously successful editor of Runway magazine, Andrea finds herself in an office that shouts Prada! Armani! Versace! at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym. With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child. <br /><br />The Devil Wears Prada gives a rich and hilarious new meaning to complaints about \"The Boss from Hell.\" Narrated in Andrea\u2019s smart, refreshingly disarming voice, it traces a deep, dark, devilish view of life at the top only hinted at in gossip columns and over Cosmopolitans at the trendiest cocktail parties. From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to Miranda\u2019s children in Paris by private jet, to locating an unnamed antique store where Miranda had at some point admired a vintage dresser, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every day\u2014and often late into the night with orders barked over the phone. She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get Andrea a top job at any magazine of her choosing. As things escalate from the merely unacceptable to the downright outrageous, however, Andrea begins to realize that the job a million girls would die for may just kill her. And even if she survives, she has to decide whether or not the job is worth the price of her soul.",

It's a riveting encounter with hardy, resourceful, colorful - and occasionally dangerous - characters who have one thing in common: a fierce love for their world of wind and water and sun, a world that Jenkins brings uniquely to life.",

            "description": "During the bloodthirsty French Revolution, the \"League of the Scarlet Pimpernel\", a secret society of 20 English aristocrats, is engaged in rescuing their French counterparts from the daily executions. Their leader, the mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel, takes his nickname from the drawing of a small red flower with which he signs his messages. Despite being the talk of London society, only his followers and possibly the Prince of Wales know the Pimpernel's true identity.\n    \n    Baroness Orczy wrote numerous sequels. Many of the sequels revolve around French characters from previous novels. The Scarlet Pimpernel's followers, such as Lord Tony Dewhurst, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, Lord Hastings and Armand St. Just, also take their turn in major roles.\n    \n    In addition to the direct sequels about the league, Orczy's related books include The Laughing Cavalier (1914) and The First Sir Percy (1921), about an ancestor of the Pimpernel's as well as Pimpernel and Rosemary (1924), about a descendant.\n    \n    Orczy did not publish her Pimpernel stories as a strict chronological series, and in fact, the settings of the books in their publication sequence may vary forward or backward in time by months or centuries. While some readers enjoy following the author's development of the Pimpernel character as it was realised, others prefer to read the stories in historical sequence.

He's lived long enough to see the cure for death and the end of scarcity, to learn ten languages and compose three symphonies...and to realize his boyhood dream of taking up residence in Disney World.<br /><br />Disney World! The greatest artistic achievement of the long-ago twentieth century. Now in the keeping of a network of \"ad-hocs\" who keep the classic attractions running as they always have, enhanced with only the smallest high-tech touches.<br /><br />Now, though, the \"ad hocs\" are under attack. A new group has taken over the Hall of the Presidents, and is replacing its venerable audioanimatronics with new, immersive direct-to-brain interfaces that give guests the illusion of being Washington, Lincoln, and all the others. For Jules, this is an attack on the artistic purity of Disney World itself. <br /><br />Worse: it appears this new group has had Jules killed. This upsets him. (It's only his fourth death and revival, after all.) Now it's war....",

    "description": "The year is A.D. 922. A refined Arab courtier, representative of the powerful Caliph of Bagdad, encounters a party of Viking warriors who are journeying to the barbaric North. He is appalled by their Viking customs -- the wanton sexuality of their pale, angular women, their disregard for cleanliness , their cold-blooded human sacrifices. But it is not until they reach the depths of the Northland that the courtier learns the horrifying and inescapable truth: He has been enlisted by these savage, inscrutable warriors to help combat a terror that plagues them -- a monstrosity that emerges under cover of night to slaughter the Vikings and devour their flesh . . .",

Only those born with the gift could learn to Sing these spirits of earth, air, fire and water into doing their bidding, and even someone as gifted as the Princess Annice must spend years studying at the Bardic Hall to truly master the Art. And for Annice, one of those rare talents able to Sing the elemental spirits from each of the four quarters, the call of magic was too strong to be denied, even if it meant renouncing her royal blood and privileges.<br /><br />But Annice might have made a different choice if she could have foreseen that ten years after she'd transferred her life and loyalties from the Royal Palace to the Bardic Hall, she'd find herself fleeing from the King's Guards. For Annice was twice guilty of treason, first for imperiling the order of succession by becoming pregnant, and second for aiding the father of her unborn child, the Duc of Ohrid, to escape the palace dungeons and the sentence of death hanging over his head.<br /><br />Now the fugitives' only hope lay in tracking down and bringing to justice the enemy who'd masterminded the Duc's downfall, a dangerous foe who had found a way to tie lies and truths together into a knot even the most powerful of Bardic spells could not unravel...",

    "description": "<b>THE SONG OF DEATH-</b><br /><br />Bannon and Vree, brother and sister, they are assassins of the highest caliber who have long plied their trade for the Havalkeen army. But all their skill and experience cannot save them from a magic-sprung trap that will see the two forced to share one body when the very man they've been sent to assassinate steals Bannon's body for himself. How long brother and sister can coexist in one body neither can guess. And so they set out to catch and defeat this foe who has already bested them once.<br /><br />But when Bannon and Vree confront this master of a magic beyond their comprehension, he offers them a terrible choice - to continue their new dual existence forever, or to betray the Empire they have served all their lives. For it is not control of Bannon's body which is Gyhard's true goal but rather the body - and with it the identity and power - of the Imperial Prince!",

    "description": "As a society, we are no less obsessed with the immediate than when Eugene Peterson first wrote this Christian classic. If anything, email and the Internet may have intensified our quest for the quick fix. But Peterson's time-tested prescription for discipleship remains the same--a long obedience in the same direction. Tucked away in the Hebrew Psalter, Peterson discovered \"an old dog-eared songbook,\" the Songs of Ascents that were sung by pilgrims on their way up to worship in Jerusalem. In these songs (Psalms 120-134) Peterson finds encouragement for modern pilgrims as we learn to grow in worship, service, joy, work, happiness, humility, community and blessing. This 20th anniversary edition of <em>A Long Obedience in the Same Direction</em> features these Psalms in Peterson's widely acclaimed paraphrase, <em>The Message.</em> He also includes an epilogue in which he reflects on the themes of this book and his ministry during the twenty years since its original publication.",

    "description": "Claire Hansen, the Keeper, is summoned to the Elysian Fields Guest House to reseal a hole in the basement, which is literally an opening to Hell. The owner and monitor of the site disappears, leaving Claire stuck managing the place until the problem is solved. Her new employee, Dean McIssac, is a gorgeous Newfie who cooks, cleans, and lives the Boy Scout oath. Then there's Jacques Labaet: very French Canadian, very sexy, very dead. Jacques is a ghost who wants to be the man in Claire's life. Oh yeah, and there's Austin, a talking cat with attitude: \"I barely know you, but I'm assuming you're human. I'm not saying this is a good thing, it's just the way it is.\"",

    "description": "In this exquisitely rendered memoir set on the high plains of Texas, Pulitzer Prize winner Gail Caldwell transforms into art what it is like to come of age in a particular time and place. <br /><br /><b>A Strong West Wind</b> begins in the 1950s in the wilds of the Texas Panhandle\u2013a place of both boredom and beauty, its flat horizons broken only by oil derricks, grain elevators, and church steeples. Its story belongs to a girl who grew up surrounded by dust storms and cattle ranches and summer lightning, who took refuge from the vastness of the land and the ever-present wind by retreating into books. What she found there, from renegade women to men who lit out for the territory, turned out to offer a blueprint for her own future. Caldwell would grow up to become a writer, but first she would have to fall in love with a man who was every mother\u2019s nightmare, live through the anguish and fire of the Vietnam years, and defy the father she adored, who had served as a master sergeant in the Second World War. <br /><br /><b>A Strong West Wind</b> is a memoir of culture and history\u2013of fathers and daughters, of two world wars and the passionate rebellions of the sixties. But it is also about the mythology of place and the evolution of a sensibility: about how literature can shape and even anticipate a life.<br /><br />Caldwell possesses the extraordinary ability to illuminate the desires, stories, and lives of ordinary people. <br /><br />Written with humanity, urgency, and beautiful restraint, <b>A Strong West Wind</b> is a magical and unforgettable book, destined to become an American classic.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "Alex Cross was a rising star in the Washington, DC, Police Department when an unknown shooter gunned down his wife, Maria, in front of him. The killer was never found, and the case turned cold, filed among the unsolved drive-bys in D.C.'s rough neighborhoods.<br /><br />Years later, still haunted by his wife's death, Cross is making a bold move in his life. Now a free agent from the police and the FBI, he's set up practice as a psychologist once again. His life with Nana Mama, Damon, Jannie, and little Alex is finally getting in order. He even has a chance at a new love.<br /><br />Then Cross's former partner, John Sampson, calls in a favor. He is tracking a serial rapist in Georgetown, one whose brutal modus operandi recalls a case Sampson and Cross worked together years earlier. When the case reveals a connection to Maria's death, Cross latches on for the most urgent and terrifying ride of his life.<br /><br />From the man USA TODAY has called the \"master of the genre,\" CROSS is the high-velocity thriller James Patterson and Alex Cross's fans have waited years to read - and the pinnacle of the bestselling detective series of the past two decades.<br /><br />This novel was originally published under the title Cross. The movie tie-in editions are published under the title Alex Cross. (less)",

    "description": "One of the most important theologians of the twentieth century illuminates the relationship between ourselves and the teachings of Jesus in this classic text on ethics, humanism, and civic duty.<br /><br />What can the call to discipleship, the adherence to the word of Jesus, mean today to the businessman, the soldier, the laborer, or the aristocrat? What did Jesus mean to say to us? What is his will for us today? Drawing on the Sermon on the Mount, Dietrich Bonhoeffer answers these timeless questions by providing a seminal reading of the dichotomy between \"cheap grace\" and \"costly grace.\" \"Cheap grace,\" Bonhoeffer wrote, \"is the grace we bestow on ourselves...grace without discipleship....Costly grace is the gospel which must be sought again and again, the girl which must be asked for, the door at which a man must know....It is costly because it costs a man his life, and it is grace because it gives a man the only true life.\"<br /><br /><i>The Cost of Discipleship</i> is a compelling statement of the demands of sacrifice and ethical consistency from a man whose life and thought were exemplary articulations of a new type of leadership inspired by the Gospel, and imbued with the spirit of Christian humanism and a creative sense of civic duty.",

    "description": "An alien pyramid has appeared on Earth, squatting in the middle of Chicago. It is growing, destroying the city as it does \u2014 and nothing seems able to stop it, not even the might of the US military. Somehow, the alien device is snatching people and \u2014 for unknown reasons \u2014 transporting them into worlds of mythology. Dr Lukacs is one of the victims. Granted, he's an expert on mythology. But myths are not something he'd thought to encounter personally. Or wanted to! Sure, he has a couple of tough paratroopers along with him, as well as a blonde Amazon biologist and a very capable maintenance mechanic. Unfortunately, modern weapons don't work, and the Greek gods are out to kill the heroes.<br /><br />Well, yes, they've got Medea and Arachne and the Sphinx on their side (both Sphinxes, actually \u2014 the Greek version as well as the Egyptian). And at least some of the Egyptian gods seem friendly.<br /><br />But that can be a very mixed blessing, to say the least. Oh, and whatever you do\u2014don't mention dwarf-tossing.",

Only a few months later, asking for military aid against advancing Northeners, comes Corlath, the Hillfolk King.

Hari is trained in the arts of war until she is a match for any of the elite royal guard, and carries Aerin's famed Blue Sword. Does she have the courage to accept her true fate?",

    "description": "For over thirty years <em>The God Who Is There</em> has been the landmark book that changed the way the church sees the world. In Francis Schaeffer's remarkable analysis, we learn where the clashing ideas about God, science, history and art came from and where they are going. Now this completely retypeset edition includes a new introduction by James W. Sire that places Schaeffer's seminal work in the context of the intellectual turbulence of the early twenty-first century. More than ever, <em>The God Who Is There</em> demonstrates how historic Christianity can fearlessly confront the competing philosophies of the world. The God who has always been there continues to provide the anchor of truth and the power of love to meet the world's deepest problems.",

He's no knight in shining armor. He's a hradani, a race known for their uncontrollable rages, bloodthirsty tendencies, and inability to maintain civilized conduct. None of the other Five Races of man <i>like</i> the hradani. Besides his ethnic burden, Bahzell has problems of his own to deal with: a violated hostage bond, a vengeful prince, a price on his head. He doesn't want to mess with anybody else's problems, let alone a god's. Let alone the <i>War</i> God's! So how does he end up a thousand leagues from home, neck-deep in political intrigue, assassins, demons, psionicists, evil sorcery, white sorcery, dark gods, <i>good</i> gods, bad poets, greedy landlords, and most of Bortalik Bay? Well, it's all the War God's fault.",

Around it, blue dolphins swim, otters play, and sea elephants and sea birds abound. Once, Indians also lived on the island. And when they left and sailed to the east, one young girl was left behind.<br /><br />This is the story of Karana, the Indian girl who lived alone for years on the Island of the Blue Dolphins. Year after year, she watched one season pass into another and waited for a ship to take her away. But while she waited, she kept herself alive by building shelter, making weapons, finding food, and fighting her enemies, the wild dogs. It is not only an unusual adventure of survival, but also a tale of natural beauty and personal discovery.",

And so the doughty young Labrador retriever, the roguish bull terrier and the indomitable Siamese set out through the Canadian wilderness. Separately, they would soon have died. But, together, the three house pets faced starvation, exposure, and wild forest animals to make their way home to the family they love. <i>The Incredible Journey</i> is one of the great children's stories of all time--and has been popular ever since its debut in 1961.",

Melville's spirit informs every page of her tour de force.<br /><br />Una Spenser's marriage to Captain Ahab is certainly a crucial element in the narrative of <em>Ahab's Wife,</em> but the story covers vastly more territory.

But when her mother, Mami, a force of nature, takes off to New York with her seven, soon to be eleven children, Esmeralda, the oldest, must learn new rules, a new language, and eventually a new identity. In the first of her three acclaimed memoirs, Esmeralda brilliantly recreates her tremendous journey from the idyllic landscape and tumultuous family life of her earliest years, to translating for her mother at the welfare office, and to high honors at Harvard.",

Now, in <i>The Turkish Lover</i>, Esmeralda finally breaks out of the monumental struggle with her powerful mother, only to elope into the spell of an exotic love affair. At the heart of the story is Esmeralda's relationship with \"the Turk,\" a passion that gradually becomes a prison out of which she must emerge to become herself. The expansive humanity, earthy humor, and psychological courage that made Esmeralda's first two books so successful are on full display again in <i>The Turkish Lover</i>.",

    "description": "<i>Tell Me No Lies</i> is a celebration of the very best investigative journalism, and includes writing by some of the greatest practitioners of the craft: Seymour Hersh on the My Lai massacre; <b>Paul Foot </b>on the Lockerbie cover-up; Wilfred Burchett, the first Westerner to enter Hiroshima following the atomic bombing; Israeli journalist Amira Hass, reporting from the Gaza Strip in the 1990s; Gunter Wallraff, the great German undercover reporter; Jessica Mitford on 'The American Way of Death'; Martha Gelhorn on the liberation of the death camp at Dachau.<br /><br />The book - a selection of articles, broadcasts and books extracts that revealed important and disturbing truths - ranges from across many of the critical events, scandals and struggles of the past fifty years. Along the way it bears witness to epic injustices committed against the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, East Timor and Palestine.<br /><br />John Pilger sets each piece of reporting in its context and introduces the collection with a passionate essay arguing that the kind of journalism he celebrates here is being subverted by the very forces that ought to be its enemy. Taken as a whole, the book tells an extraordinary 'secret history' of the modern era. It is also a call to arms to journalists everywhere - before it is too late.",

Sachs</b> is renowned for his work around the globe advising economies in crisis. Now a classic of its genre, <i>The End of Poverty </i>distills more than thirty years of experience to offer a uniquely informed vision of the steps that can transform impoverished countries into prosperous ones. Marrying vivid storytelling with rigorous analysis, Sachs lays out a clear conceptual map of the world economy. Explaining his own work in Bolivia, Russia, India, China, and Africa, he offers an integrated set of solutions to the interwoven economic, political, environmental, and social problems that challenge the world's poorest countries.<br /> \u00a0<br /> Ten years after its initial publication, <i>The End of Poverty </i>remains an indispensible and influential work. In this 10th anniversary edition, Sachs presents an extensive new foreword assessing the progress of the past decade, the work that remains to be done, and how each of us can help. He also looks ahead across the next fifteen years to 2030, the United Nations' target date for ending extreme poverty, offering new insights and recommendations.",

Jonathan Franzen's THE CORRECTIONS was the best-loved and most written-about novel of 2001. Nearly every in-depth review of it discussed what became known as 'The Harper's Essay, ' Franzen's controversial 1996 look at the fate of the novel. This essay is reprinted for the first time in HOW TO BE ALONE, alongside the personal essays and painstaking, often funny reportage that earned Franzen a wide readership before the success of THE CORRECTIONS. Although his subjects range from the sex-advice industry to the way a supermax prison works, each piece wrestles with familiar themes of Franzen's writing: the erosion of civic life and private dignity, and the hidden persistence of loneliness, in postmodern, imperial America. Alzheimer's disease and a rueful account of Franzen's brief tenure as an Oprah Winfrey author. As a collection, these essays record what Franzen calls 'a movement away from an angry and frightened isolation toward an acceptance -- even a celebration -- of being a reader and a writer. ' At the same time they show the wry distrust of the claims of technology and psychology, the love-hate relationship with consumerism, and the subversive belief in the tragic shape of the individual life that help make Franzen one of the sharpest, toughest-minded, and most entertaining social critics at work today.",

After three failed engagements, she realises it's time for a <b>PLAN</b>...and organised, detailed agenda with a clear goal: finding <b>Mr. Right</b>.<br /><br />The Cabins resort is ripe with eligible bachelors, all rich, distinguished and ambitious - just her type. And they're dropping like flies around her...at least, that's how Jake Templeton views the situation. After he's stuck pulling her latest reject out of the swimming pool, Jake's convinced this femme fatale is trouble. Especially for him.<br /><br />But can a man who's sworn off ambition for good and a woman hanging from the top of the corporate ladder find common ground in the unpredictable territory called the heart, where the word <i>proposal</i> takes on a very different meaning...?",

    "description": "A faithful yet totally original contemporary spin on a classic, Dante's Inferno as interpreted by acclaimed artist Sandow Birk and writer Marcus Sanders is a journey through a Hell that bears an eerie semblance to our own world. Birk, hailed by the Los Angeles Times as one of realism's edgier, more visionary painters, offers extraordinarily nuanced and vivid illustrations inspired by Gustave Dore's famous engravings. This modern interpretation depicts an infernal landscape infested with mini-malls, fast food restaurants, ATMs, and other urban fixtures, and a text that cleverly incorporates urban slang and references to modern events and people (as Dante did in his own time). Previously published in a deluxe, fine-press edition to wide praise, and accompanied by national exhibitions, this striking paperback edition of Dante's Inferno is a genuinely provocative and insightful adaptation for a new generation of readers.",

    "description": "When lives are dominated by hunger, what becomes of love? When assaulted by daily acts of violence and untimely death, what happens to trust? Set in the lands of Northeast Brazil, this is an account of the everyday experience of scarcity, sickness and death that centres on the lives of the women and children of a hillside \"favela\". Bringing her readers to the impoverished slopes above the modern plantation town of Bom Jesus de Mata, where she has worked on and off for 25 years, Nancy Scheper-Hughes follows three generations of shantytown women as they struggle to survive through hard work, cunning and triage. It is a story of class relations told at the most basic level of bodies, emotions, desires and needs. Most disturbing \u2013 and controversial \u2013 is her finding that mother love, as conventionally understood, is something of a bourgeois myth, a luxury for those who can reasonably expect, as these women cannot, that their infants will live.",

    "description": "For fifty years, Anna Schlemmer has refused to talk about her life in Germany during World War II. Her daughter, Trudy, was only three when she and her mother were liberated by an American soldier and went to live with him in Minnesota. Trudy's sole evidence of the past is an old photograph: a family portrait showing Anna, Trudy, and a Nazi officer, the Obersturmfuhrer of Buchenwald.<br /><br />Driven by the guilt of her heritage, Trudy, now a professor of German history, begins investigating the past and finally unearths the dramatic and heartbreaking truth of her mother's life.<br /><br />Combining a passionate, doomed love story, a vivid evocation of life during the war, and a poignant mother/daughter drama, <i>Those Who Save Us</i> is a profound exploration of what we endure to survive and the legacy of shame.",

    "description": "A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. <br /><br />The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.<br /><br />Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. <br /><br />We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don\u2019t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the \u201cimpossible.\u201d<br /><br />For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. Now, in this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don\u2019t know. He offers surprisingly simple tricks for dealing with black swans and benefiting from them.<br /><br />Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications <i>The Black Swan</i> will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory. <br /><br /><i>The Black Swan</i> is a landmark book \u2013 itself a black swan.<br /><br />The book also contains a 4-page glossary; 19 pages of notes; and, a 28-page bibliography in addition to an index.",

    "description": "Every kid thinks about running away at one point or another; few get farther than the end of the block. Young Sam Gribley gets to the end of the block and keeps going--all the way to the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York. There he sets up house in a huge hollowed-out tree, with a falcon and a weasel for companions and his wits as his tool for survival. In a spellbinding, touching, funny account, Sam learns to live off the land, and grows up a little in the process. Blizzards, hunters, loneliness, and fear all battle to drive Sam back to city life. But his desire for freedom, independence, and adventure is stronger. No reader will be immune to the compulsion to go right out and start whittling fishhooks and befriending raccoons. <p> Jean Craighead George, author of more than 80 children's books, including the Newbery Medal-winning <i>Julie of the Wolves</i>, created another prizewinner with <i>My Side of the Mountain</i>--a Newbery Honor Book, an ALA Notable Book, and a Hans Christian Andersen Award Honor Book. Astonishingly, she wrote its sequel, <i>On the Far Side of the Mountain</i>, 30 years later, and a decade after that penned the final book in the trilogy, <i>Frightful's Mountain</i>, told from the falcon's point of view. George has no doubt shaped generations of young readers with her outdoor adventures of the mind and spirit. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>",

The series first appeared in French in Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me, a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le XXe Si\u00e8cle  on 10 January 1929. The success of the series saw the serialised strips collected into a series of twenty-four albums, spun into a successful magazine and adapted for film, radio, television and theatre. \n    \n    Set during a largely realistic 20th century, the hero of the series is <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/characters/1770-tintin\">Tintin</a>, a young Belgian reporter. He is aided in his adventures from the beginning by his faithful fox terrier dog <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/characters/33343-snowy\">Snowy</a> (Milou in French). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash, cynical and grumpy <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/characters/3080-captain-archibald-haddock\">Captain Haddock</a>, the highly intelligent but hearing-impaired <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/characters/86001-professeur-tournesol\">Professor Calculus</a> (Professeur Tournesol) and other supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/characters/3083-thomson-thompson\">Thomson and Thompson</a> (Dupont et Dupond). Herg\u00e9 himself features in several of the comics as a background character, as do his assistants in some instances.",

Initially, titles were published by Grosset & Dunlap, but with #57 (1979) publication switched to Simon & Schuster. Some people consider these first 56 to be the original series and consider the Simon & Schuster series to be an entirely different series. The first 56 are considered to be the \"classic\" Nancy Drew books. In 2003, the series was discontinued, and a new, more contemporary series <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/40765-nancy-drew-girl-detective\">(Nancy Drew Girl Detective)</a> was created in its place.\n    \n    The series may be published in different orders in translation; see:\n    * <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/84730-siri-salma\">Siri Salma</a>",

When she's very, very angry, the little girl's Magic Finger takes over. She really can\u2019t control it, and now it's turned the Greggs into birds! Before they know it, the Greggs are living in a nest, and that's just the beginning of their problems\u2026<br />",

    "description": "<div>My English comp teacher Mr. Glicksberg says if you want to be a writer you have to, quote, sit on a window sill and get all pensive and stuff and jot down descriptions. Unquote Glicksberg! I don't know what kind of things he writes but I found my inspiration in Malibu with a radio, my best girlfriends, and absolutely zillions of boys for miles. I absolutely had to write everything down because I heard that when you get older you forget things, and I'd be the most miserable woman in the world if I forgot all about Moondoggie and what happened this summer. I absolutely owe the world my story. (And every word is true. I swear.) <p>This is Franzie, part Holden Caulfield, part Lolita. The guys call her Gidget--short for \"girl midget\u201d--and she\u2019s a girl coming of age in the summer of 1957. Based on the experiences of his own daughter, Frederick Kohner's trend-setting novel became an international sensation and turned its irrepressible heroine into an American pop culture icon whose voice still echoes every thrill, every fear, and every hope that every teenager ever had about growing up. </p></div>",

    "description": "Published here in its entirety, Frida Kahlo's amazing illustrated journal documents the last ten years of her turbulent life. This passionate, often surprising, intimate record, kept under lock and key for some forty years in Mexico, reveals many new dimensions in the complex persona of this remarkable Mexican artist.<br /><br />Covering the years 1944-45, the 170-page journal contains Frida's thoughts, poems, and dreams, and reflects her stormy relationship with her husband, Diego Rivera, Mexico's famous artist. The seventy watercolor illustrations in the journal - some lively sketches, several elegant self-portraits, others complete paintings - offer insights into her creative process, and show her frequently using the journal to work out pictorial ideas for her canvases.<br /><br />The text entries, written in Frida's round, full script in brightly colored inks, add an almost decorative quality, making the journal as captivating to look at as it is to read. Frida's childhood, her political sensibilities, and her obsession with Diego are all illuminated in witty phrases and haunting images.<br /><br />Although much has been written recently about this extraordinary woman, Frida Kahlo's art and life continue to fascinate the world. This personal document, published in a complete full-color facsimile edition, will add greatly to the understanding of her unique and powerful vision and her enormous courage in the face of more than thirty-five operations to correct injuries she had sustained in an accident at the age of eighteen. The facsimile is accompanied by an introduction by the world-renowned Mexican man of letters Carlos Fuentes and a complete translation of the diary's text. An essay on the place of the diary in Frida's work and in art history at large, as well as commentaries on the images, is provided by Sarah M. Lowe.",

For three days, a quartet of voices explores the air, making confessions, seeking alignments, quarreling, pleading, and pardoning. They are not entirely alone: ghosts (fathers, lovers, children) press upon them, as do phantoms from the near future (nurses, lawyers, land developers). <i>Of the Farm </i>concerns the places people choose to live their lives, and the strategies they use to stand their ground.",

    "description": "The protagonist of Siri Hustvedt's astonishing second novel is a heroine of the old style: tough, beautiful, and brave. Standing at the threshold of adulthood, she enters a new world of erotic adventure, profound but unexpected friendship, and inexplicable, frightening acts of madness. Lily's story is also the story of a small town--Webster, Minnesota--where people are brought together by a powerful sense of place, both geographical and spiritual. Here gossip, secrets, and storytelling are as essential to the bond among its people as the borders that enclose the town.<br /><br />The real secret at the heart of the book is the one that lies between reality and appearances, between waking life and dreams, at the place where imagination draws on its transforming powers in the face of death.",

    "description": "Pegged as the loser in a small-town family that doesn't have much going for it in the first place, Ruth grows up (unlovely and unloved) in the shadow of her mean and brilliant brother, Matt, trying to hold her own in a world of poverty and hard edges. The little happiness she finds is in reading the books on tape for old, blind Miss Finch and in the letters she receives from her adored Aunt Sid. Matt's genius for mathematics is his escape from Honey Creek, but Ruth, with no ticket out, cleaves instead to her tough and bitter mother, May, who continues to trickle out the last of her love to Matt even as he leaves them without a backward glance. Eventually Ruth meets and falls for Ruby, the sweet but slightly deranged man she marries and supports. Ruth spots stains at Trim 'N Tidy Dry Cleaners, bowls at the Town Lanes, and tries in vain to keep the peace between May, whose lashing criticisms blow through the cramped house with gale force, and Ruby, who spends his days getting stoned and watching reruns of Bewitched on TV. The arrival of Justy, Ruth and Ruby's newborn son, temporarily suspends everyone in mutual joy, but soon the baby becomes the object of their most heated contention. When the precarious household erupts in violence, Ruth is the only one who can piece their story together - and she gets at the truth in a manner at once ferocious, hilarious, and heartbreaking.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />In this powerful, incandescent novel, Jane Hamilton has worked a small miracle: She has given voice to a young woman you have passed on the street a thousand times. Perhaps you have never noticed her, but the next time you see her, you will know who she is. Passionate in her commitment to life, Ruth is a stunning testament to the human capacity for mercy, compassion and love. <i>The Book of Ruth</i> is Hamilton's magnificent d\ufffdbut.",

It is both a portrait of the artist and a discovery of the aesthetic by which the portrait is painted, and it was to have an immense influence on the literature of the twentieth century.\n    \n    The novel contains seven volumes:\n    <b>1 - Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de chez Swann</b> (1913): Swann's Way / The Way by Swann's\n    (Part I: Combray / Overture. Part II: Un Amour de Swann / Swann in Love. Part III : Noms de pays: le nom / Names of places: the name)\n    <b>2 - \u00c0 l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs</b> (1919): In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower / Within a Budding Grove\n    <b>3 - Le C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Guermantes</b> (1920-1921): The Guermantes Way \n    <b>4 - Sodome et Gomorrhe</b> (1921-1922): Sodom and Gomorrah / Cities of the Plain\n    <b>5 - La Prisonni\u00e8re</b> (1923): The Prisoner / The Captive\n    <b>6 - Albertine disparue / La Fugitive</b> (1925): Albertine Gone / The Fugitive / The Sweet Cheat Gone\n    <b>7 - Le Temps retrouv\u00e9</b> (1927): Time Regained / The Past Recaptured / Finding Time Again\n    \n    The novel is being adapted as a <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/65593-remembrance-of-things-past-graphic-novel-adaptation\">graphic novel</a> by [author:St\u00e9phane Heuet|119580].\n    \n    <b>In Search of Lost Time</b> is Marcel Proust\u2019s masterpiece, known for its length and the notion of involuntary memory, the most famous example being the \"episode of the madeleine\". The complete story contains nearly 1.5 million words and is one of the longest novels in world literature.\n    \n    <b>\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu</b> is translated as:\n    English: In Search of Lost Time / Remembrance of Things Past*\n    Spanish: En busca del tiempo perdido\n    German: Auf der Suche nach der verlorenen Zeit\n    Portugese: Em Busca do Tempo Perdido\n    Italian: Alla ricerca del tempo perduto\n    Dutch: Op zoek naar de verloren tijd\n    Swedish: P\u00e5 spaning efter den tid som flytt\n    Polish: W poszukiwaniu straconego czasu\n    Turkish: Kay\u0131p Zaman\u0131n \u0130zinde\n    Bulgarian: \u041f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0433\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\n    *In English the novel is widely referred to as <b>Remembrance of Things Past</b> but the title <b>In Search of Lost Time</b>, a literal rendering of the French, has gained in usage since D.J. Enright's adopted it in his 1992 revision of the earlier translation by C.K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin.",

    "description": "With the knowledge of the forces of nature which the resources of the astral plane place at the command of its inhabitants the production of what are called \"spirit lights\" is a very easy matter...-from The Astral PlaneAn engrossing document of the public fascination with the paranormal at the turn of the 20th century, this 1895 volume explains one aspect of theosophy, the metaphysical doctrine that seeks to find the unified truth buried in all of humanity's religions. On this guided tour of one of the \"various planes of the universe,\" you'll meet black magicians, vampires, werewolves, elemental essences, fairies, and angels. You'll encounter phenomena including churchyard ghosts, mysterious bell ringing, clairvoyance, second sight, spirit photographs, slate writing, and levitation. And you'll learn why darkness is absolutely required at a seance. Don't leave this plane of existence without it.CHARLES WEBSTER LEADBEATER (1847-1934) was one of the foremost writings on theosophical topics of the early 20th century. He is also the author of The Aura: An Enquiry into the Nature and Functions of the Luminous Mist Seen about Human and Other Bodies (1895) and Dreams: What They Are and How They Are Caused (1896).",

    "description": "This is a wonderful new episode from the world of Philip Pullman's bestselling trilogy, His Dark Materials. In Lyra's Oxford the reader shares the huge excitement of discovering a small bundle of material that has somehow slipped between Lyra's universe and our own. The book includes a wonderful new story by Philip Pullman, fully illustrated intricate maps and other ephemera from Lyra's universe. The text is illustrated throughout in beautiful black and white wood-blocks by the highly acclaimed engraver, John Lawrence, together with specially printed three-colour pull out maps of Lyra's Oxford. This publication could have come from a parallel universe. The short story contained within Lyra's Oxford finds Lyra with her daemon Pantalaimon a couple of years after the end of The Amber Spyglass. Sitting on the roofs of Oxford she sees a bird, the d\u00e6mon of a witch, a storm petrel flying towards her pursued by a huge and angry flock of starlings. Birds play a big part in this story.

    "description": "Elantris was the capital of Arelon: gigantic, beautiful, literally radiant, filled with benevolent beings who used their powerful magical abilities for the benefit of all. Yet each of these demigods was once an ordinary person until touched by the mysterious transforming power of the Shaod. Ten years ago, without warning, the magic failed. Elantrians became wizened, leper-like, powerless creatures, and Elantris itself dark, filthy, and crumbling.<br /><br />Arelon's new capital, Kae, crouches in the shadow of Elantris. Princess Sarene of Teod arrives for a marriage of state with Crown Prince Raoden, hoping -- based on their correspondence -- to also find love. She finds instead that Raoden has died and she is considered his widow. Both Teod and Arelon are under threat as the last remaining holdouts against the imperial ambitions of the ruthless religious fanatics of Fjordell. So Sarene decides to use her new status to counter the machinations of Hrathen, a Fjordell high priest who has come to Kae to convert Arelon and claim it for his emperor and his god.<br /><br />But neither Sarene nor Hrathen suspect the truth about Prince Raoden. Stricken by the same curse that ruined Elantris, Raoden was secretly exiled by his father to the dark city. His struggle to help the wretches trapped there begins a series of events that will bring hope to Arelon, and perhaps reveal the secret of Elantris itself.<br /><br />A rare epic fantasy that doesn't recycle the classics and that is a complete and satisfying story in one volume, Elantris is fleet and fun, full of surprises and characters to care about. It's also the wonderful debut of a welcome new star in the constellation of fantasy.",

    "description": "What happens when a four-star chef and a culinary minimalist decide to join forces to create something different? They invent a new style that adapts to every occasion and every level of cooking expertise. <b>Simple to Spectacular</b> introduces a unique concept developed by one of the world's top chefs, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and Mark Bittman, author of How to Cook Everything and the New York Times's hugely popular column \"The Minimalist.\" Ever since their award-winning collaboration on Jean-Georges: Cooking at Home with a Four-Star Chef, the acclaimed duo has been cooking up a repertoire of new dishes that can be prepared in any of five progressively sophisticated ways.<br /><br /><b>Simple to Spectacular</b> features a total of 250 recipes in 50 groups. Each group begins with a simple, elegant recipe--a few ingredients combined for maximum effect--followed by fully detailed, increasingly elaborate variations. For example, a recipe for Grilled Shrimp with Thyme and Lemon leads to Grilled Shrimp and Zucchini on Rosemary Skewers, Grilled Shrimp with Apple Ketchup, Thai-style Grilled Shrimp on Lemongrass Skewers, and Grilled Shrimp Balls with Cucumber and Yogurt.<br />Every aspect of the meal is covered, from superb soups and salads to unforgettable side dishes, entrees, and desserts. In <b>Simple to Spectacular</b>, everything--from the basics to innovations by a four-star chef--is tailored for a quick Tuesday night dinner or an elegant weekend party.\u00a0\u00a0And in the now-classic Vongerichten-Bittman style, all of the recipes can be made in the kitchen of any home cook. With 80 full-color photographs giving a mouthwatering view of the Simple-to-Spectacular transformations, readers and cooks will eagerly explore the possibilities.Jean-Georges Vongerichten (right) won the 1998 James Beard Award for Outstanding Chef and Best New Restaurant. His Manhattan restaurants include Vong, Jo Jo, The Mercer Kitchen, and Jean Georges, which earned a rare four-star rating from the New York Times.\u00a0\u00a0<br /><br />In <b>Simple to Spectacular</b>, two titans of the food world have created a truly groundbreaking cookbook.\u00a0\u00a0Here are 250 superb recipes arranged in a uniquely useful way: a basic recipe and four increasingly sophisticated variations, with each group (there are 50 groups in all) based on a given technique.\u00a0\u00a0This ingenious organization enables cooks of all levels of expertise to understand how a recipe is created and to re-create the brilliantly simple recipes and dazzling variations from one of our best food writers and home cooks teamed with one of America's greatest chefs.",

    "description": "Among the many \"how-to\" playwriting books that have appeared over the years, there have been few that attempt to analyze the mysteries of play construction. Lajos Egri's classic, <i>The Art of Dramatic Writing</i>, does just that, with instruction that can be applied equally well to a short story, novel, or screenplay. <br />Examining a play from the inside out, Egri starts with the heart of any drama: its characters. All good dramatic writing hinges on people and their relationships, which serve to move the story forward and give it life, as well as an understanding of human motives - why people act the way that they do. Using examples from everything from William Shakespeare's <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> to Henrik Ibsen's <i>A Doll's House</i>, Egri shows how it is essential for the author to have a basic premise - a thesis, demonstrated in terms of human behavior - and to develop the dramatic conflict on the basis of that behavior.<br />Using Egri's ABCs of premise, character, and conflict, <i>The Art of Dramatic Writing</i> is a direct, jargon-free approach to the problem of achieving truth in writing.",

    "description": "<div>B.K.S. Iyengar--hailed as \"the Michelangelo of yoga\" (BBC) and considered by many to be the most important living yoga master--has spent much of his life introducing the modern world to the ancient practice of yoga. Yoga's popularity is soaring, but its widespread acceptance as an exercise for physical fitness and the recognition of its health benefits have not been matched by an understanding of the emotional, intellectual, and spiritual development that the yogic tradition can also offer. In <i>Light on Life</i>, B.K.S. Iyengar brings readers this new and more complete understanding of the yogic journey. Written with the depth of this sage's great wisdom, Light on Life is the culmination of a master's spiritual genius, a treasured companion to his seminal Light on Yoga. </div>",

    "description": "<i>1 Dead in Attic</i> is a collection of stories by <i>Times-Picayune</i> columnist Chris Rose, recounting the first harrowing year and a half of life in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Celebrated as a local treasure and heaped with national praise, Rose provides a rollercoaster ride of observation, commentary, emotion, tragedy, and even humor in a way that only he could find in a devastated wasteland.<br /><br />They are stories of the dead and the living, stories of survivors and believers, stories of hope and despair. And stories about refrigerators. <br /><br /><i>1 Dead in Attic</i> freeze-frames New Orleans, caught between an old era and a new, during its most desperate time, as it struggles out of the floodwaters and wills itself back to life.",
