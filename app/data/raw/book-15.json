    "description": "<i>\"It is the horrible texture of a fabric that should be woven of ships' cables and hawsers. A Polar wind blows through it, and birds of prey hover over it.\"</i> <br /><br />So Melville wrote of his masterpiece, one of the greatest works of imagination in literary history. In part, <i>Moby-Dick</i> is the story of an eerily compelling madman pursuing an unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopaedia of whaling lore and legend, the book can be seen as part of its author's lifelong meditation on America. Written with wonderfully redemptive humour, <i>Moby-Dick</i> is also a profound inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception.",

One father (Robert's real father) was a highly educated man but fiscally poor. The other was the father of Robert's best friend - that dad was a college drop-out who became a self-made multi-millionaire. In this follow-up to the bestselling Rich Dad, Poor Dad, he reveals the secret of how the wealthiest people become wealthier by presenting some simple investing secrets and explaining how anyone can enjoy cash benefits merely by knowing where and how best to invest their money.",

    "description": "Hanky-panky on the international art scene is the source of the hilarity and fizz in Peter Mayle's new novel. He flies us back to the south of France (a region some readers of his irresistible best-sellers believe him to have invented), on a wild chase through galleries, homes of prominent collectors, and wickedly delectable restaurants. There are stopovers in the Bahamas and England, and in New York, where that glossiest of magazines, Decorating Quarterly, reflects the cutting-edge trendiness of its editor, Camilla Jameson Porter. (Camilla has recently broken new ground in the world of power lunches by booking two tables on the same day, and shuttling between them, at the city's trendiest restaurant.)<br /><br />It is Camilla who has sent our hero, Andre Kelly, to Cap Ferrat to take glamorous photo-graphs of the houses and treasures of the rich, famous, and fatuous. He happens to have his camera at the ready when he spots a C\u00e9zanne being loaded onto a plumber's truck near the home of an absent collector. Odd, thinks Andre. And in no time he's on the trail of a state-of-the-art art scam, chasing C\u00e9zanne.<br /><br />It's a joy to follow him and the crowds intent on speeding or foiling his quest--including a beautiful agent; a super-savvy art dealer attracted to the finer things in life, especially if they promise the payoff of a lifetime; an awesome Dutch forger; some outstandingly greedy New York sophisticates; and, invisible in the background, the parade of remarkable chefs whose mouthwatering culinary masterpieces periodically soothe the hero and tantalize the reader of Chasing C\u00e9zanne.",

    "description": "The legendary Japanese master's <i>Winter Sleep</i> take you into the hardboiled world of art -- where ex-cons are philosophers, young lovers are combustible, and aesthetics is life. An artist's quest for growth from one of the world's greatest stylists. <br /><br />Nakagi, an ex-con painter who has sequestered hismself in a mountain cabin, is trying to elevate his art. The only thing breakin his solitude are the visits of two women: an art dealer who wants him to produce the sort of paintings that she would like to buy from him, and a young aspiring, and soulful apprentice. When Nakagi welcomes an escaped felon into the emotionally fraught fold, and begins to teach him to pain well. <i>Winter Sleep</i> awakens to a literally incendiary climax.",

    "description": "When the phone rang on a gloomy fall afternoon in 1990, Gr\u00e9goire Bouillier had no way of knowing that it was the woman who\u2019d left him, without warning, ten years before. And he couldn\u2019t have guessed why she was calling\u2014not to apologize for, or explain, the way she\u2019d vanished from his life, but to invite him to a party. A birthday party. For a woman he\u2019d never met. <br /><br />This is the story of how one man got over a broken heart, learned to love again, stopped wearing turtlenecks, regained his faith in literature, participated in a work of performance art by mistake, and spent his rent money on a bottle of 1964 bordeaux that nobody ever drank. <i>The Mystery Guest </i>is, in the words of <i>L\u2019Humanit\u00e9</i>, a work of \u201cfiendish wit and refinement.\u201d It pushes the conventions of autobiography (and those great themes of French literature: love and aging) to an absurd, poignant, and very funny conclusion. This translation marks the English-language debut of an iconoclast who has attracted one of the most passionate cult followings in French literature today.",

The resident software millionaire wants to call it New Prospera; the mayor wants to return to the original choice of the founding black settlers; and the town\u2019s aristocracy sees no reason to change the name at all. What they need, they realize, is a nomenclature consultant. And, it turns out, the consultant needs them. But in a culture overwhelmed by marketing, the name is everything and our hero\u2019s efforts may result in not just a new name for the town but a new and subtler truth about it as well.",

Veering between nervous excitability and debilitating ennui, he gluts his aesthetic appetites with classical literature and art, exotic jewels (with which he fatally encrusts the shell of his tortoise), rich perfumes, and a kaleidoscope of sensual experiences. The original handbook of decadence, <i>Against Nature</i> exploded like a grenade (in the words of its author) and has enjoyed a cult readership from its publication to the present day.",

After all it can\u2019t be easy to be sixteen with a hairless \u201cundistinguishable from that of a five year old\u2019s.\u201d<br /><br />This wonderfully entertaining memoir is a touching and humorous look at life in New York City. But this is life for an author who can proclaim \u201cmy first sexual experience was rather old-fashioned: it was with a prostitute\u201d\u2013an author who can talk about his desire to be a model for the Hair Club for Men and about meeting his son for the first time. <br /><br />Often insightful, sometimes tender, always witty and self-deprecating, <b>What\u2019s Not to Love?</b> is an engaging memoir from one of our most funny, most daring writers.",

That rule was soon abandoned, and since then McSweeney\u2019s has attracted work from some of the finest writers in the country, including Denis Johnson, Jonathan Franzen, William T. Vollmann, Rick Moody, Joyce Carol Oates, Heidi Julavits, Jonathan Lethem, Michael Chabon, Ben Marcus, Susan Straight, Roddy Doyle, T.C. Boyle, Steven Millhauser, Gabe Hudson, Robert Coover, Ann Beattie, and many others. At the same time, the journal continues to be a major home for new and unpublished writers; we\u2019re committed to publishing exciting fiction regardless of pedigree.\n    \n    Each issue of the quarterly is completely redesigned. There have been hardcovers and paperbacks, an issue with two spines, an issue with a magnetic binding, an issue that looked like a bundle of junk mail, and an issue that looked like a sweaty human head. McSweeney\u2019s has won multiple literary awards, including two National Magazine Awards for fiction, and has had numerous stories appear in The Best American Magazine Writing, the O. Henry Awards anthologies, and The Best American Short Stories. Design awards given to the quarterly include the AIGA 50 Books Award, the AIGA 365 Illustration Award, and the Print Design Regional Award.",

    "description": "Brilliant and original, <b>A Thousand Years of Good Prayers</b> introduces a remarkable new writer whose breathtaking stories are set in China and among Chinese Americans in the United States. In this rich, astonishing collection, Yiyun Li illuminates how mythology, politics, history, and culture intersect with personality to create fate. From the bustling heart of Beijing, to a fast-food restaurant in Chicago, to the barren expanse of Inner Mongolia, <b>A Thousand Years of Good Prayers</b> reveals worlds both foreign and familiar, with heartbreaking honesty and in beautiful prose.<br /><br />\u201cImmortality,\u201d winner of The Paris Review\u2019s Plimpton Prize for new writers, tells the story of a young man who bears a striking resemblance to a dictator and so finds a calling to immortality. In \u201cThe Princess of Nebraska,\u201d a man and a woman who were both in love with a young actor in China meet again in America and try to reconcile the lost love with their new lives. <br /><br />\u201cAfter a Life\u201d illuminates the vagaries of marriage, parenthood, and gender, unfolding the story of a couple who keep a daughter hidden from the world. And in \u201cA Thousand Years of Good Prayers,\u201d in which a man visits America for the first time to see his recently divorced daughter, only to discover that all is not as it seems, Li boldly explores the effects of communism on language, faith, and an entire people, underlining transformation in its many meanings and incarnations.<br /><br />These and other daring stories form a mesmerizing tapestry of revelatory fiction by an unforgettable writer.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "Not all whites in South Africa are outright racists. Some, like Bam and Maureen Smales in Nadine Gordimer's thrilling and powerful novel <i>July's People</i>, are sensitive to the plights of blacks during the apartheid state. So imagine their quandary when the blacks stage a full-scale revolution that sends the Smaleses scampering into isolation. The premise of the book is expertly crafted; it speaks much about the confusing state of affairs of South Africa and serves as the backbone for a terrific adventure.",

    "description": "There is a paradox at the heart of our lives. We all want more money, but as societies become richer, they do not become happier. This is not speculation: It's the story told by countless pieces of scientific research. We now have sophisticated ways of measuring how happy people are, and all the evidence shows that on average people have grown no happier in the last fifty years, even as average incomes have more than doubled.The central question the great economist Richard Layard asks in <b>Happiness</b> is this: If we really wanted to be happier, what would we do differently? First we'd have to see clearly what conditions generate happiness and then bend all our efforts toward producing them. That is what this book is about-the causes of happiness and the means we have to effect it.<br /><br />Until recently there was too little evidence to give a good answer to this essential question, but, Layard shows us, thanks to the integrated insights of psychology, sociology, applied economics, and other fields, we can now reach some firm conclusions, conclusions that will surprise you. <b>Happiness</b> is an illuminating road map, grounded in hard research, to a better, happier life for us all.",

    "description": "The world as we know it today began in California in the late 1800s, and Eadweard Muybridge had a lot to do with it. This striking assertion is at the heart of Rebecca Solnit\u2019s new book, which weaves together biography, history, and fascinating insights into art and technology to create a boldly original portrait of America on the threshold of modernity. The story of Muybridge\u2014who in 1872 succeeded in capturing high-speed motion photographically\u2014becomes a lens for a larger story about the acceleration and industrialization of everyday life. Solnit shows how the peculiar freedoms and opportunities of post\u2013Civil War California led directly to the two industries\u2014Hollywood and Silicon Valley\u2014that have most powerfully defined contemporary society.",

    "description": "Described as \"the closest thing to a rock star\" in graphic design today (USA Today), Chip Kidd is universally recognized as an American master of contemporary book design. At the forefront of a revolution in publishing, Kidd's iconic covers, with their inventive marriage of type and found images, have influenced an entire generation of design practitioners in many fields.Chip Kidd: Book One collects all of his book covers and designs for the first time, as well as hundreds of developmental sketches and concepts-annotated by Kidd and by many of the best-selling authors he's worked with over the years. The result is an important contribution to the design canon today as well as a visually dazzling (and often hilarious) insider's look at the design and publishing process.The book also showcases Kidd's work with comics and graphic novels, including his collaborations with leading artists and writers in the field. Featured are projects for DC Comics, including Batman and Superman, as well as Kidd's award-winning exploration of the art of Charles M. Schulz. Chip Kidd: Book One is sure to enthrall design aficionados, book lovers, pop-culture fanatics, comics fans, and design students.",

Enter Angela Argo, a pierced, tattooed student with a rare talent for writing. Angela is just the thing Swenson needs. And, better yet, she wants his help. But, as we all know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. . . .<br /><br />Deliciously risqu\u00e9, Blue Angel is a withering take on today's academic mores and a scathing tale that vividly shows what can happen when academic politics collides with political correctness.",

    "description": "While the youth counterculture remains the most evocative and best-remembered symbol of the cultural ferment of the 1960s, the revolution that shook American business during those boom years has gone largely unremarked. In this fascinating and revealing study, Thomas Frank shows how the youthful revolutionaries were joined\u2014and even anticipated \u2014by such unlikely allies as the advertising industry and the men's clothing business.<br /><br />\"[Thomas Frank is] perhaps the most provocative young cultural critic of the moment.\"\u2014Gerald Marzorati, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br /><br />\"An indispensable survival guide for any modern consumer.\"\u2014<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review<br /><br />\"Frank makes an ironclad case not only that the advertising industry cunningly turned the countercultural rhetoric of revolution into a rallying cry to buy more stuff, but that the process itself actually predated any actual counterculture to exploit.\"\u2014Geoff Pevere, <i>Toronto Globe and Mail</i><br /><br />\"<i>The Conquest of Cool</i> helps us understand why, throughout the last third of the twentieth century, Americans have increasingly confused gentility with conformity, irony with protest, and an extended middle finger with a populist manifesto. . . . His voice is an exciting addition to the soporific public discourse of the late twentieth century.\"\u2014T. J. Jackson Lears, <i>In These Times</i><br /><br />\"An invaluable argument for anyone who has ever scoffed at hand-me-down counterculture from the '60s. A spirited and exhaustive analysis of the era's advertising.\"\u2014Brad Wieners, <i>Wired Magazine</i><br /><br />\"Tom Frank is . . . not only old-fashioned, he's anti-fashion, with a place in his heart for that ultimate social faux pas, leftist politics.\"\u2014Roger Trilling, <i>Details</i><br />",

    "description": "<div>David Lynch erupted onto the cinema landscape in 1977 with <i>Eraserhead</i>, establishing himself as one of the most original and imaginative directors at work in contemporary cinema. Over the course of his career, he has remained true to a vision of the innocent lost in darkness and confusion, balancing hallucination and surrealism with a sense of Americana that is as pure and simple as his compelling storylines. In this volume, Lynch speaks openly about his films as well as about his lifelong commitment to painting, his work in photography, his television projects, and his musical collaborations with Angelo Badalamenti.<br /></div>",

    "description": "Oakley Hall's legendary <i>Warlock</i> revisits and reworks the traditional conventions of the Western to present a raw, funny, hypnotic, ultimately devastating picture of American unreality. First published in the 1950s, at the height of the McCarthy era, Warlock is not only one of the most original and entertaining of modern American novels but a lasting contribution to American fiction.<br /><br />\"Tombstone, Arizona, during the 1880's is, in ways, our national Camelot: a never-never land where American virtues are embodied in the Earps, and the opposite evils in the Clanton gang; where the confrontation at the OK Corral takes on some of the dry purity of the Arthurian joust. Oakley Hall, in his very fine novel Warlock has restored to the myth of Tombstone its full, mortal, blooded humanity. Wyatt Earp is transmogrified into a gunfighter named Blaisdell who . . . is summoned to the embattled town of Warlock by a committee of nervous citizens expressly to be a hero, but finds that he cannot, at last, live up to his image; that there is a flaw not only in him, but also, we feel, in the entire set of assumptions that have allowed the image to exist. . . . Before the agonized epic of Warlock is over with--the rebellion of the proto-Wobblies working in the mines, the struggling for political control of the area, the gunfighting, mob violence, the personal crises of those in power--the collective awareness that is Warlock must face its own inescapable Horror: that what is called society, with its law and order, is as frail, as precarious, as flesh and can be snuffed out and assimilated back into the desert as easily as a corpse can. It is the deep sensitivity to abysses that makes <i>Warlock</i> one of our best American novels. For we are a nation that can, many of us, toss with all aplomb our candy wrapper into the Grand Canyon itself, snap a color shot and drive away; and we need voices like Oakley Hall's to remind us how far that piece of paper, still fluttering brightly behind us, has to fall.\" --Thomas Pynchon",

    "description": "More than a century after its publication (1899), <i>Heart of Darkness</i> remains an indisputably classic text and arguably Conrad's finest work.<br /><br />This extensively revised Norton Critical Edition includes new materials that convey nineteenth-century attitudes toward imperialism as well as the concerns of Conrad's contemporaries about King Leopold's exploitation of his African domain. New to the Fourth Edition are excerpts from Adam Hochschild's recent book, <i>King Leopold's Ghost</i>, and from Sir Roger Casement's influential \"Congo Report\" on Leopold's atrocities. \"Backgrounds and Contexts\" also provides readers with a collection of photographs and a map that bring the Congo Free State to life.<br /><br />A new section, \"Nineteenth-Century Attitudes toward Race,\" includes writings by, among others, Hegel, Darwin, and Sir Francis Galton. New essays by Patrick Brantlinger, Marianna Torgovnik, Edward W. Said, Hunt Hawkins, Anthony Fothergill, and Paul Armstrong debate Chinua Achebe's controversial indictment of the novel's depiction of Africans and offer differing views about whether Conrad's beliefs about race were progressive or retrograde.<br /><br />A rich selection of writings by Conrad on his life in the Congo is accompanied by extensive excerpts from his essays about art and literature. \"Criticism\" presents a wealth of new materials on <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, including contemporary responses by Henry James, E.M. Forster, Ford Madox Ford, and Virginia Woolf. Recent critical assessments by Peter Brooks, Jeremy Hawthorn, Daphna Erdinast-Vulcan, Andrew Michael Roberts, J. Hillis Miller, and Lissa Schneider cover a ranger of topics, from narrative theory to philosophy and sexuality. Also new to the Fourth Edition is a selection of writings on the connections between the novel and the film <i>Apocalypse Now</i>.<br /><br />This Norton Critical Edition is again based on Robert Kimbrough's meticulously re-edited text of the novel. An expanded Textual Appendix allows the reader to follow Conrad's revisions at different stages of the creative process. A Chronology has been added, and the Selected Bibliography has been revised and updated.",

    "description": "\"This is not everyone's favorite, but its on everyone's list. This is the most widely published and read book on spirituality in our tradition. It is amazing how well its medieval monkishness carries over into the modern world. When Dag Hammarskjold was killed in an airplane crash in Africa, the books found in his briefcase were the Bible and <i>The Imitation</i>.\"<br />--Eugene Peterson, from his book Take and Read<br /><br />Next to the Bible itself, <i>The Imitation of Christ </i>is the most-published--and most deeply cherished--book in any language. For nearly 600 years, these thoughtful meditations on Jesus' life and teachings offer practical guidance on the central task of the Christian life: learning day by day to live like Jesus. This modern translation is direct and concise, yet retains a deep devotional flavor.<br /><br />Every Christian library needs the classics--the timeless books that have spoken powerfully to generations of believers. Now Hendrickson Christian Classics allows readers to build an essential classics library in affordable modern editions. Each volume is freshly retypeset for reading comfort, while thoughtful new introductions place each in historical and spiritual context. Attractive, classically bound covers look great together on the shelf. Best of all, value pricing makes this series easy to own. Planned to span the spectrum of Christian wisdom through the ages, Hendrickson Christian Classics sets a new standard for quality and value.<br />",

    "description": "The official illustrated companion book to the winner of five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Russell Crowe), Costume Design, Sound, and Visual Effects.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott (<em>Blade Runner</em>, <em>Thelma and Louise</em>, <em>Alien</em>) brings the glorious battles of the ancient Roman arena back to the big screen. Set against the splendor and barbarity of the Roman Empire in AD 180, <em>Gladiator</em> tells an epic story of courage and revenge: The great Roman general Maximus (Russell Crowe) has been forced into exile and slavery by the jealous heir to the throne, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Trained as a gladiator, Maximus returns to Rome, intent on avenging the murder of his family by Commodus, now emperor. The one power stronger than that of the emperor is the will of the people, and Maximus knows he can attain his revenge only by becoming the greatest hero in all the Empire. Russell Crowe heads up an international cast that includes Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielson, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, and Richard Harris. Directed by Ridley Scott from a script by David Franzoni and John Logan, Gladiator is produced by Franzoni, Douglas Wick, and Branko Lustig, with Walter F. Parkes serving as executive producer.<br /><br />This is the official full-color companion book, featuring excerpts from the screenplay, historical sidebars and illustrations, details on period costumes and epic set designs, behind-the-scenes photographs from the location filming, and interviews with the screenwriters, actors, and director.",

S. Army. He captures military life -- from the drama of combat to the daily routine -- with total accuracy, and reveals the roles and missions that have in recent years distinguished our fighting forces. <br /><br />Armored Cav includes:<br /><br />Descriptions of the M1A2 Main Battle Tank, the AH-64A Apache Attack Helicopter, and more<br /><br /><br />An interview with General Frederick Franks<br /><br /><br />Strategies behind the Desert Storm account<br /><br /><br />Exclusive photograph, illustrations and diagrams<br /><br /><b><br />PLUS:</b> From West Point cadet to Desert Storm commander . . . an interview with a combat cavalry officer on the rise.",

    "description": "At once a pioneering study of evolution and an accessible and lively reading experience, <i>The Mating Mind</i> marks the arrival of a prescient and provocative new science writer. Psychologist Geoffrey Miller offers the most convincing-and radical-explanation for how and why the human mind evolved.<br /><br />Consciousness, morality, creativity, language, and art: these are the traits that make us human. Scientists have traditionally explained these qualities as merely a side effect of surplus brain size, but Miller argues that they were sexual attractors, not side effects. He bases his argument on Darwin's theory of <i>sexual </i>selection, which until now has played second fiddle to Darwin's theory of <i>natural </i>selection, and draws on ideas and research from a wide range of fields, including psychology, economics, history, and pop culture. Witty, powerfully argued, and continually thought-provoking, <i>The Mating Mind</i> is a landmark in our understanding of our own species.",

    "description": "Is there a theory that explains the essence of consciousness? Or is consciousness itself just an illusion? The \"last great mystery of science,\" consciousness was excluded from serious research for most of the last century but is now a rapidly expanding area of study for students of psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience. Recently the topic has also captured growing popular interest. <br /> This groundbreaking book is the first volume to bring together all the major theories of consciousness studies--from those rooted in traditional Western philosophy to those coming out of neuroscience, quantum theory, and Eastern philosophy. Broadly interdisciplinary, Consciousness: AnIntroduction is divided into nine sections that examine such topics as how subjective experiences arise from objective brain processes, the basic neuroscience and neuropathology of consciousness, altered states of consciousness, mystical experiences and dreams, and the effects of drugs and meditation. It also discusses the nature of self, the possibility of artificial consciousness in robots, and the question of whether or not animals are conscious. Enhanced by numerous illustrations and profiles of important researchers, the book also includes self-assessment questions, further reading suggestions, and practical exercises that help bring the subject to life.",

    "description": "<em>Civilization and Its Discontents</em> may be Sigmund Freud's best-known work. Originally published in 1930, it seeks to answer ultimate questions: What influences led to the creation of civilization? How did it come to be? What determines its course? In this seminal volume of twentieth-century thought, Freud elucidates the contest between aggression, indeed the death drive, and its adversary eros. He speaks to issues of human creativity and fulfillment, the place of beauty in culture, and the effects of repression.<br /><br /><br />Louis Menand, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>The Metaphysical Club</em>, contributor to <em>The New Yorker,</em> and professor of English at Harvard University, reflects on the importance of this work in intellectual thought and why it has become such a landmark book for the history of ideas.<br /><br /><br />Not available in hardcover for decades, this beautifully rendered anniversary edition will be a welcome addition to readers' shelves.",

    "description": "From the acclaimed writer Peter Ho Davies comes an engrossing wartime love story set in the stunning landscape of North Wales during the final, harrowing months of World War II. <br /><br />Young Esther Evans has lived her whole life within the confines of her remote mountain village. The daughter of a fiercely nationalistic sheep farmer, Esther yearns for a taste of the wider world that reaches her only through broadcasts on the BBC. Then, in the wake of D-day, the world comes to her in the form of a German POW camp set up on the outskirts of Esther's village. <br /><br />The arrival of the Germans in the camp is a source of intense curiosity in the local pub, where Esther pulls pints for both her neighbors and the unwelcome British guards. One summer evening she follows a group of schoolboys to the camp boundary. As the boys heckle the prisoners across the barbed wire fence, one soldier seems to stand apart. He is Karsten Simmering, a German corporal, only eighteen, a young man of tormented conscience struggling to maintain his honor and humanity. To Esther's astonishment, Karsten calls out to her. <br /><br />These two young people from worlds apart will be drawn into a perilous romance that calls into personal question the meaning of love, family, loyalty, and national identity. The consequences of their relationship resonate through the lives of a vividly imagined cast of characters: the drunken BBC comedian who befriends Esther, Esther's stubborn father, and the resentful young British \"evacuee\" who lives on the farm-even the German-Jewish interrogator investigating the most notorious German prisoner in Wales, Rudolf Hess. <br /><br />Peter Ho Davies has been hailed for his \"all-encompassing empathy that is without borders\" (<i>Elle</i>). That trancendent compassion shines through <i>The Welsh Girl</i>, a novel that is both thought-provoking and emotionally enthralling.",

    "description": "Meet Harry Pickles, the fastest boy in the world (well, at least in school), big brother to Daniel (who runs like a girl but is, in his own twerpy way, a star), and the firstborn son of Mo and Pa, the best-looking parents in their Notting Hill elementary school parking lot. Harry's life, like any other nine-year-old's, is a colorful, frenetic, and fun blur of lunch boxes, vocabulary tests, and keeping up with his pals Piggy and Terry-not to mention keeping an eye on his kid brother Daniel. Mo, a successful, well-known journalist, and Pa, a surgeon, have built a wonderful world for Harry and Daniel to grow up in, but when a school outing results in Daniel's vanishing, the complicated adult world of police investigations and interviews, searches of the countryside, recriminations, and ultimate responsibility comes crashing in on a very confused Harry.<br /><br />Told with an utterly compelling and exuberant sense of truth, <i>Hide and Seek</i> is a fresh debut of tense mystery, disarming humor, and remarkable compassion.<br />",

Holmes, master of disguise, reasoned logically to deduce clients' background from their first appearance. He used fingerprints, chemical analysis, and forensic science.\n    \n    The majority of the stories were first published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>  accumulated to four novels and fifty-six short stories set 1880-1914.\n    \n    All but four stories are narrated by Holmes's friend and biographer, Dr John H. Watson; two are narrated by Holmes himself (<i>The Blanched Soldier</i> and <i>The Lion's Mane</i>) and two others are written in the third person (<i>The Mazarin Stone</i> and <i>His Last Bow</i>). In two stories (<i>The Musgrave Ritual</i> and <i>The Gloria Scott</i>), Holmes tells Watson the main story from his memories, while Watson becomes the narrator of the frame story. The first and fourth novels, <i>A Study in Scarlet</i> and <i>The Valley of Fear</i>, each include long omniscient narration of events unknown to Holmes or Watson.",

In <em>House Thinking</em>, journalist and cultural critic Winifred Gallagher takes the reader on a psychological tour of the American home. By drawing on the latest research in behavioral science, an overview of cultural history, and interviews with leading architects and designers, she shows us not only how our homes reflect who we are but also how they influence our thoughts, feelings, and actions.<br /><br />How does your entryway prime you for experiencing your home? What makes a bedroom a sensual oasis? How can your bathroom exacerbate your worst fears? <em>House Thinking</em> addresses provocative questions like these, enabling us to understand the homes we've made for ourselves in a unique and powerful new way. It is an eye-opening look at how we live . . . and how we <em>could</em> live.",

    "description": "In a narrative that moves with dreamlike swiftness from India to England to Africa, Nobel Laureate V. S. Naipaul has produced his finest novel to date, a bleakly resonant study of the fraudulent bargains that make up an identity.<br /><br />The son of a Brahmin ascetic and his lower-caste wife, Willie Chandran grows up sensing the hollowness at the core of his father's self-denial and vowing to live more authentically. That search takes him to the immigrant and literary bohemias of 1950s London, to a facile and unsatisfying career as a writer, and at last to a decaying Portugese colony in East Africa, where he finds a happiness he will then be compelled to betray. Brilliantly orchestrated, at once elegiac and devastating in its portraits of colonial grandeur and pretension, <b>Half a Life</b> represents the pinnacle of Naipaul's career.",

    "description": "This poetic novel, by the acclaimed author of John Dollar, describes America at the brink of the Atomic Age. In the years between the two world wars, the future held more promise than peril, but there was evidence of things unseen that would transfigure our unquestioned trust in a safe future. <br /><br />Fos has returned to Tennessee from the trenches of France. Intrigued with electricity, bioluminescence, and especially x-rays, he believes in science and the future of technology. On a trip to the Outer Banks to study the Perseid meteor shower, he falls in love with Opal, whose father is a glassblower who can spin color out of light.<br /><br />Fos brings his new wife back to Knoxville where he runs a photography studio with his former Army buddy Flash. A witty rogue and a staunch disbeliever in Prohibition, Flash brings tragedy to the couple when his appetite for pleasure runs up against both the law and the Ku Klux Klan. Fos and Opal are forced to move to Opal's mother's farm on the Clinch River, and soon they have a son, Lightfoot. But when the New Deal claims their farm for the TVA, Fos seeks work at the Oak Ridge Laboratory -- Site X in the government's race to build the bomb. <br /><br />And it is there, when Opal falls ill with radiation poisoning, that Fos's great faith in science deserts him. Their lives have traveled with touching inevitability from their innocence and fascination with \"things that glow\" to the new world of manmade suns. <br /><br />Hypnotic and powerful, <i>Evidence of Things Unseen</i> constructs a heartbreaking arc through twentieth-century American life and belief.",

In it, Marguerite Yourcenar reimagines the Emperor Hadrian's arduous boyhood, his triumphs and reversals, and finally, as emperor, his gradual reordering of a war-torn world, writing with the imaginative insight of a great writer of the twentieth century while crafting a prose style as elegant and precise as those of the Latin stylists of Hadrian's own era.",

    "description": "\"The myth of Marie Curie - the penniless Polish immigrant who through genius and obsessive persistence endured years of toil and deprivation to produce radium, a luminous panacea for all the world's ills, including cancer - has obscured the remarkable truth behind her discoveries. Marie Curie's shrewd though controversial insight was that radioactivity was an atomic property that could be used to discover new elements. While her work won her two Noble Prizes and transformed our world, it did not liberate her from the prejudices of either the male-dominated scientific community or society.\" \"In Obsessive Genius, the author and historian Barbara Goldsmith has discovered the woman behind the icon we have come to believe in - an all-too-human woman trying to balance a scientific career with the obligations of family, the prejudice of society, the constant search for adequate funding, and the battle for recognition.\" Using original research (diaries, letters, and family interviews) to peel away the layers of myth, Goldsmith offers a portrait of Marie Curie, her amazing discoveries, and the immense price she paid for fame.",

    "description": "In this splendid new translation of Voltaire\u2019s satiric masterpiece, all the celebrated wit, irony, and trenchant social commentary of one of the great works of the Enlightenment is restored and refreshed.<br /><br />Voltaire may have cast a jaundiced eye on eighteenth-century Europe\u2013a place that was definitely <i>not</i> the \u201cbest of all possible worlds.\u201d But amid its decadent society, despotic rulers, civil and religious wars, and other ills, Voltaire found a mother lode of comic material. And this is why Peter Constantine\u2019s thoughtful translation is such a pleasure, presenting all the book\u2019s subtlety and ribald joys precisely as Voltaire had intended. <br /><br />The globe-trotting misadventures of the youthful Candide; his tutor, Dr. Pangloss; Martin, and the exceptionally trouble-prone object of Candide\u2019s affections, Cun\u00e9gonde, as they brave exile, destitution, cannibals, and numerous deprivation, provoke both belly laughs and deep contemplation about the roles of hope and suffering in human life. <br /><br />The transformation of Candide\u2019s outlook from panglossian optimism to realism neatly lays out Voltaire\u2019s philosophy\u2013that even in Utopia, life is less about happiness than survival\u2013but not before providing us with one of literature\u2019s great and rare pleasures.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

Some money from each copy of <b>Speaking with the Angel</b> sold will benefit autism education charities around the world, including The Treehouse School in London, where Nick\u2019s son Danny is a student, and the New York Child Learning Institute here in the States. This project is truly a labor of love for Hornby and the other writers involved, many of whom are Nick\u2019s friends.<br /><br />These original first-person narratives come from the most exciting voices in fiction. Melissa Bank gives readers a glimpse into the mind of a modern New Yorker whose still-new relationship is a constant source of surprise in \u201cThe Wonder Spot.\u201d In Zadie Smith\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m the Only One,\u201d a young man recalls his strained relationship with his diva-esque sister. Dave Egger\u2019s \u201cAfter I Was Thrown in the River and Before I Drowned,\u201d is told from the viewpoint of an unfortunate pit bull. Helen Fielding offers up a new twist on I\u2019ve fallen and I can\u2019t get up in \u201cLuckybitch.\u201d And in Nick Hornby\u2019s \u201cNippleJesus,\u201d a bruiser finds out that guarding modern art is far more hazardous than controlling the velvet ropes at a nightclub. <b>Speaking with the Angel</b> also includes stories from Roddy Doyle, Irvine Welsh, Colin Firth, John O\u2019Farrell, Robert Harris, Patrick Marber, and Giles Smith.<br /><br />Twelve completely new stories, written by twelve undeniably imaginative voices. <b>Speaking with the Angel</b> is at turns clever, outrageous, witty, edgy, tender, and wicked. This is what they meant by original.",

    "description": "Over a decade ago, Arthur Danto announced that art ended in the sixties. Ever since this declaration, he has been at the forefront of a radical critique of the nature of art in our time. After the End of Art presents Danto's first full-scale reformulation of his original insight, showing how, with the eclipse of abstract expressionism, art has deviated irrevocably from the narrative course that Vasari helped define for it in the Renaissance. Moreover, he leads the way to a new type of criticism that can help us understand art in a posthistorical age where, for example, an artist can produce a work in the style of Rembrandt to create a visual pun, and where traditional theories cannot explain the difference between Andy Warhol's Brillo Box and the product found in the grocery store. Here we are engaged in a series of insightful and entertaining conversations on the most relevant aesthetic and philosophical issues of art, conducted by an especially acute observer of the art scene today.<br /><br />Originally delivered as the prestigious Mellon Lectures on the Fine Arts, these writings cover art history, pop art, \"people's art,\" the future role of museums, and the critical contributions of Clement Greenberg--who helped make sense of modernism for viewers over two generations ago through an aesthetics-based criticism. Tracing art history from a mimetic tradition (the idea that art was a progressively more adequate representation of reality) through the modern era of manifestos (when art was defined by the artist's philosophy), Danto shows that it wasn't until the invention of Pop art that the historical understanding of the means and ends of art was nullified. Even modernist art, which tried to break with the past by questioning the ways of producing art, hinged on a narrative.<br /><br />Traditional notions of aesthetics can no longer apply to contemporary art, argues Danto. Instead he focuses on a philosophy of art criticism that can deal with perhaps the most perplexing feature of contemporary art: that everything is possible.",

As Harold Bloom writes, \"Hagedorn expresses the conflicts experienced by Asian immigrants caught between cultures . . . she takes aim at racism in the U.S. and develops in her dramas the themes of displacement and the search for belonging.\"<br /><br /><b>Jessica Hagedorn </b>is a performance artist, poet, novelist and playwright, born and raised in the Philippines. Her novels include <i>Dogeaters </i>(Penguin 1990) which was nominated for a National Book Award and <i>The Gangster of Love </i>(Penguin 1996); a short story collection, <i>Danger and Beauty </i>(City Lights 2002).",

    "description": "In this bold new work of cultural criticism, Ann Cvetkovich develops a queer approach to trauma. She argues for the importance of recognizing---and archiving---accounts of trauma that belong as much to the ordinary and everyday as to the domain of catastrophe. Cvetkovich contends that the field of trauma studies, limited by too strict a division between the public and the private, has overlooked the experiences of women and queers. Rejecting the pathologizing understandings of trauma that permeate medical and clinical discourses on the subject, she develops instead a sex-positive approach missing even from most feminist work on trauma. <em>An Archive of Feelings</em> challenges the field to engage more fully with sexual trauma and the wide range of feelings in its vicinity, including those associated with butch-femme sex and AIDS activism and <br />caretaking.<br /><br /><i>An Archive of Feelings</i> brings together oral histories from lesbian activists involved in act/up New York; readings of literature by Dorothy Allison, Leslie Feinberg, Cherrie Moraga, and Shani Mootoo; videos by Jean Carlomusto and Pratibha Parmar; and performances by Lisa Kron, Carmelita Tropicana, and the bands Le Tigre and Tribe 8. Cvetkovich reveals how these cultural formations---activism, performance, and literature---give rise to public cultures that both work through trauma and transform the conditions producing it. By looking closely at connections between sexuality, trauma, and the creation of lesbian public cultures, Cvetkovich makes those experiences that have been pushed to the peripheries of trauma culture the defining principles of a new construction of sexual trauma-one in which trauma catalyzes the creation of cultural archives and political communities.<br /><br />About the Author: Ann Cvetkovich is Associate Professor of English at the University of Texas at Austin. She is the author of <em>Mixed Feelings: Feminism, Mass Culture, and Victorian Sensationalism.</em>",

    "description": "In a small town called Dundee on the coast of Maine, an old woman named Hannah Gray begins her story: \"Somebody said 'true love is like ghosts, which everyone talks about and few have seen.' I've seen both and I don't know how to tell you which is worse.\" Hannah has decided, finally, to leave a record of the passionate and anguished long-ago summer in Dundee when she met Conary Crocker, the town bad boy and love of her life. This spare, piercing, and unforgettable novel bridges two centuries and two intense love stories as Hannah and Conary's fate is interwoven with the tale of a marriage that took place in Dundee a hundred years earlier.",

The question of what happened preoccupies not only an ensuing negligence trial but also the narrator, Bobby and Carole's daughter, Susan, who lives alone in her parents' house near the coast of Maine. Assisted by court transcripts, a notebook computer containing Ruth Farr's journal, and a young vagrant who has taken to camping on her doorstep, Susan lays open the moral predicament at the heart of the book: we are culpable beings, even though we live in a world of imperfect knowledge.",

Saskia's elaborate fantasies are soon upstaged by her real-life, long-lost father, who leads Saskia and her best friend Jane on a camping trip that turns into an epic adventure of love, sex, and lies.<br /><br />Saskia is as unforgettable as her own heroes, a young girl whose story resonates with a rare and joyous sense of life and discovery.",

    "description": "David Sacks has embarked on a fun, lively, and learned excursion into the alphabet\u2013and into cultural history\u2013in<i> Letter Perfect</i>. Clearly explaining the letters as symbols of precise sounds of speech, the book begins with the earliest known alphabetic inscriptions (circa 1800 b.c.), recently discovered by archaeologists in Egypt, and traces the history of our alphabet through the ancient Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans and up through medieval Europe to the present day. But the heart of the book is the twenty-six fact-filled \u201cbiographies\u201d of letters A through Z, each one identifying the letter\u2019s particular significance for modern readers, tracing its development from ancient forms, and discussing its noteworthy role in literature and other media. We learn, for example, why letter X may have a sinister and sexual aura, how B came to signify second best, why the word <i>mother</i> in many languages starts with M. Combining facts both odd and essential, <i>Letter Perfect</i> is cultural history at its most accessible and enjoyable.",

In playful narratives, lyrical outbursts, and overheard conversations, Hoagland cruises the milieu, exploring the spiritual vacancies of American satisfaction. With humor, rich tonal complexity, and aggressive moral intelligence, these poems bring pity to our folly and celebrate our resilience.",

    "description": "The author of \"The Untouchable\" (\"contemporary fiction gets no better than this\"--Patrick McGrath, \"The New York Times Book Review\") now gives us a luminous novel about love, loss, and the unpredictable power of memory. <br />The narrator is Max Morden, a middle-aged Irishman who, soon after his wife's death, has gone back to the seaside town where he spent his summer holidays as a child--a retreat from the grief, anger, and numbness of his life without her. But it is also a return to the place where he met the Graces, the well-heeled vacationing family with whom he experienced the strange suddenness of both love and death for the first time. The seductive mother; the imperious father; the twins--Chloe, fiery and forthright, and Myles, silent and expressionless--in whose mysterious connection Max became profoundly entangled, each of them a part of the \"barely bearable raw immediacy\" of his childhood memories. <br />Interwoven with this story are Morden's memories of his wife, Anna--of their life together, of her death--and the moments, both significant and mundane, that make up his life now: his relationship with his grown daughter, Claire, desperate to pull him from his grief; and with the other boarders at the house where he is staying, where the past beats inside him \"like a second heart.\" <br />What Max comes to understand about the past, and about its indelible effects on him, is at the center of this elegiac, vividly dramatic, beautifully written novel--among the finest we have had from this extraordinary writer.",

    "description": "Believer Books has collected, in alphabetical order, twenty-three conversations and correspondences between much admired writers and the writers they admire. The interviews include favorites gleaned from the pages of the <i>Believer</i> magazine along with previously unpublished conversations. The book is rife with astonishing insights and profound quips. To wit:<br /><br />George Saunders: \u2018I see writing as part of an ongoing attempt to really, viscerally, believe that everything matters, suffering is real, and death is imminent.\u2019<br /><br />Ian McEwan: \u2018The dream, surely, that we all have, is to write this beautiful paragraph that actually is describing something but at the same time in another voice is writing commentary on its own creation, without having to be a story about a writer.\u2019<br /><br />Jamaica Kincaid: \u2018All of these declarations of what writing ought to be, which I had myself\u2014though, thank god I had never committed them to paper\u2014I think are nonsense.... You write what you write, and then either it holds up or it doesn't hold up. There are no rules or particular sensibilities. I don't believe in that all anymore.\u2019<br /><br />Janet Malcolm: \u2018The narrator of my nonfiction pieces is not the same person I am\u2014she is a lot more articulate and thinks of much cleverer things to say than I usually do.\u2019<br /><br />Paul Auster: \u2018In my own case, I certainly don't walk into my room and sit down at my desk feeling like a boxer ready to go ten rounds with Joe Louis. I tiptoe in. I procrastinate. I delay. I come in sideways, kind of sliding through the door.... I don't burst into the saloon with my six-shooter ready. If I did, I'd probably shoot myself in the foot.\u2019<br /><br />Tobias Wolff: \u2018Each time out should be a swing for the fences. Don't do base-running drills. You can do those on your own time.\u2019",

    "description": "In this elegiac and luminous novel, which John Ashbery called \"an amazing achievement\" and Mary Gordon dubbed \"a wholly original endeavor,\" Christine Schutt gives voice to the feast of memory, the mystery of the mad and missing, and the power of words. <br /><br />Set in the Midwest, where Florida represents a faraway paradise, this novel tells the story of Alice Fivey. Fatherless since she was seven, Alice is left in the care of her relatives at the age of ten, when her mother, whose \"toenails winked in the foil bed we knew for Florida,\" is institutionalized. Alice is moved from place to place, remaining still while others try to mold her into someone different from her mother. She consoles herself with books and becomes a storyteller herself as she moves into adulthood, ever further from the desolation of her mother's actions and closer to the meaning of her own experience. <br /><br />Told in brief scenes of spare beauty, Florida is a graceful and gripping tale of family, forgiveness, and creation of the self. <br /><br />",

    "description": "Gore Vidal's Narratives of Empire series spans the history of the United States from the Revolution to the post-World War II years. With their broad canvas and large cast of fictional and historical characters, the novels in this series present a panorama of the American political and imperial experience as interpreted by one of its most worldly, knowing, and ironic observers. <br /><br />Burr is a portrait of perhaps the most complex and misunderstood of the Founding Fathers. In 1804, while serving as vice president, Aaron Burr fought a duel with his political nemesis, Alexander Hamilton, and killed him. In 1807, he was arrested, tried, and acquitted of treason. In 1833, Burr is newly married, an aging statesman considered a monster by many. Burr retains much of his political influence if not the respect of all. And he is determined to tell his own story. As his amanuensis, he chooses Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler, a young New York City journalist, and together they explore both Burr's past and the continuing political intrigues of the still young United States.",

Published between 1967 and 2000, they chronicle the history of Vidal's \"American Empire\", from dawn to decay, by interweaving the private stories of two fictional American families with the public stories of historical personages. Although the seven novels were not published in order of historical chronology, they can be read in either historical or publication order without sacrificing narrative intelligibility. Vidal insisted on the title \"Narratives of Empire\" for the series, despite his publishers\u2019 preference for the safer, mainstream \"American Chronicles\".",

He resumes acquaintance with formidable Hugo, whose \u2018philosophy\u2019 he once presumptuously dared to interpret. These meetings involve Jake and his eccentric servant-companion, Finn, in a series of adventures that include the kidnapping of a film-star dog, and a political riot in a film-set of ancient Rome.

    "description": "On 25 October 1946, in a crowded room in Cambridge, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper came face to face for the first and only time. The encounter lasted only ten minutes, and did not go well. Almost immediately, rumours started to spread around the world that the two philosophers had come to blows, armed with red-hot pokers. But what really happened?<br /><br /><i>Wittgenstein's Poker</i> engagingly winds together philosophy, history and biography into a compelling piece of detective work. It ranges from the place of assimilated Jews in <i>fin de siecle</i> Vienna, to what happens to memory under stress, to a vivid portrait of Cambridge and its eccentric set of philosophy dons, including Bertrand Russell (who acted as umpire during the altercation). At the centre of the story stand the philosophers themselves, proud, irascible, larger than life, and spoiling for a fight.<br /><br />'Those ten minutes shook the world of Western philosophy literally to its foundations . . . Edmonds and Eidinow have a very good story to tell, and they tell it wonderfully well.' <i>Irish Times</i><br /><br />'A meaty, exceedingly well-researched and engaging book. In its dramatic readability <i>Wittgenstein's Poker </i>brings to mind Simon Winchester's <i>The Professor and the Madman</i>; in the depth and breadth of its scholarship it evokes Carl Schorske's <i>fin de siecle Vienna</i> . . . a marvel of passionate journalism.' <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>",

    "description": "Since its inception in 1915, the Best American series has become the premier annual showcase for the country's finest short fiction and nonfiction. For each volume, a series editor reads pieces from hundreds of periodicals, then selects between fifty and a hundred outstanding works. That selection is pared down to the twenty or so very best pieces by a guest editor who is widely recognized as a leading writer in his or her field. This unique system has helped make the Best American series the most respected -- and most popular -- of its kind.<br /><br />The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2002 is a selection for young people of the best literature from mainstream and alternative American periodicals: from the New Yorker, Jane, Rolling Stone, Zyzzyva, Vibe, The Onion, Spin, Epoch, Time, Little Engines, Modern Humorist, Esquire, and more. Dave Eggers has chosen the highlights of 2001 for this genre-busting collection that includes new fiction, essays, satire, journalism -- and much more. From Eric Schlosser on french fries to Elizabeth McKenzie on awful family to Seaton Smith on how to \"jive\" with your teen, The Best American Nonrequried Reading 2002 is the first and the best.",

    "description": "A self-professed candyfreak, Steve Almond set out in search of a much-loved candy from his childhood and found himself on a tour of the small candy companies that are persevering in a marketplace where big corporations dominate. <br />From the Twin Bing to the Idaho Spud, the Valomilk to the Abba-Zaba, and discontinued bars such as the Caravelle, Marathon, and Choco-Lite, Almond uncovers a trove of singular candy bars made by unsung heroes working in old-fashioned factories to produce something they love. And in true candyfreak fashion, Almond lusciously describes the rich tastes that he has loved since childhood and continues to crave today. Steve Almond has written a comic but ultimately bittersweet story of how he grew up on candy-and how, for better and worse, the candy industry has grown up, too. <br />Candyfreak is the delicious story of one man's lifelong obsession with candy and his quest to discover its origins in America.<br />",

In <em>Holy the Firm</em> she writes about a moth consumed in a candle flame, about a seven-year-old girl burned in an airplane accident, about a baptism on a cold beach. But behind the moving curtain of what she calls \"the hard things -- rock mountain and salt sea,\" she sees, sometimes far off and sometimes as close by as a veil or air, the power play of holy fire.<br /><br />This is a profound book about the natural world -- both its beauty and its cruelty -- the Pulitzer Prize-winning Dillard knows so well.",

This one is personal...because the murdered man was a fellow Vietnam \"tunnel rat\" who had fought side by side with him in a hellish underground war. Now Bosch is about to relive the horror of Nam. From a dangerous maze of blind alleys to a daring criminal heist beneath the city, his survival instincts will once again be tested to their limit. Pitted against enemies inside his own department and forced to make the agonizing choice between justice and vengeance, Bosch goes on the hunt for a killer whose true face will shock him.",

    "description": "A few years ago, Neal Pollack was probably the least likely father you've ever met: a pop-culture-obsessed writer and self-styled party guy known mostly for outrageous literary antics. In typical fashion, he responded to the birth of his son by forming a mediocre rock band and taking it on tour. Now, in <i>Alternadad</i>, he tells the hilarious and poignant story of how he learned to be a father to his son, Elijah, after the failure of his short-lived rock-n-roll dreams.<br />Pollack and his wife, Regina, were determined to raise their son without growing up too much themselves. They welcomed the responsibility but were worried that they'd become uptight and out of touch. Through the ups and downs of the first years of their son's life their determination is put to the test, and they find themselves changing in ways they never expected, particularly after Elijah develops a biting problem in preschool.<br /><i>Alternadad </i>is a refreshingly honest book about the wonders, terrors, and idiocies of parenting today. From enrolling his son in an absurd corporate gymnastics class to a disastrous visit to a rock festival to uncomfortable encounters with other parents whom he'd ordinarily avoid, Pollack candidly explores the everyday struggles and the long-term compromises that come with parenthood.<br />Mixing ironic skepticism with an appreciation for the absurdities of everyday life, <i>Alternadad</i> is a portrait of a new version of the American family: responsible if unorthodox parents raising kids who know the difference between the Ramones and the Sex Pistols. Wildly funny, surprising, and often moving, it just might be the parenting bible for a new generation of mothers and fathers.",

On another level it\u2019s the story of a disaffected, middle-aged black journalist on a mission to set a record for junketeering who attends the annual John Henry Days festival. It is also a high-velocity thrill ride through the tunnel where American legend gives way to American pop culture, replete with p. r. flacks, stamp collectors, blues men , and turn-of-the-century song pluggers. <b>John Henry Days</b> is an acrobatic, intellectually dazzling, and laugh-out-loud funny book that will be read and talked about for years to come.",

    "description": "R. Kikuo Johnson has created an intimate and compelling graphic novel-length drama of young men on the cusp of adulthood. First-rate prep school, S.U.V., and a dream house in the heights: This was the island paradise handed to Loren Foster when he moved to Hawaii with his father six years ago. Now, with the end of high school just around the corner, his best friend, Shane, has grown distant. The rumors say it's hard drugs, and Loren suspects that Shane has left him behind for a new group of friends. What sets Johnson's drama apart is the naturalistic ease with which he explores the relationships of his characters. It is at once an unsentimental portrait of that most awkward period between adolescence and young adulthood and that rarest of things: a mature depiction of immature lives. Visually, Johnson captures the languid tropical climate and strip mall tackiness of Hawaii in a rich chiaroscuro style reminiscent of Milton Caniff combined with the sensual ink work of Paul Pope or Jessica Abel.<br /><br /><br />2006 Russ Manning Most Promising Newcomer Award Winner; 2006 Harvey Award Winner, Best New Talent.",

His sole companion was Shimamoto, also an only child. Together they spent long afternoons listening to her father's record collection. But when his family moved away, the two lost touch. Now Hajime is in his thirties. After a decade of drifting he has found happiness with his loving wife and two daughters, and success running a jazz bar. Then Shimamoto reappears. She is beautiful, intense, enveloped in mystery. Hajime is catapulted into the past, putting at risk all he has in the present.",

    "description": "A sweeping narrative history of the events leading to 9/11, a groundbreaking look at the people and ideas, the terrorist plans and the Western intelligence failures that culminated in the assault on America. Lawrence Wright's remarkable book is based on five years of research and hundreds of interviews that he conducted in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sudan, England, France, Germany, Spain, and the United States.<br /><br /><i>The Looming Tower</i> achieves an unprecedented level of intimacy and insight by telling the story through the interweaving lives of four men: the two leaders of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri; the FBI's counterterrorism chief, John O'Neill; and the former head of Saudi intelligence, Prince Turki al-Faisal.<br /><br />As these lives unfold, we see revealed: the crosscurrents of modern Islam that helped to radicalize Zawahiri and bin Laden . . . the birth of al-Qaeda and its unsteady development into an organization capable of the American embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and the attack on the USS<i> Cole</i> . . . O'Neill's heroic efforts to track al-Qaeda before 9/11, and his tragic death in the World Trade towers . . . Prince Turki's transformation from bin Laden's ally to his enemy . . . the failures of the FBI, CIA, and NSA to share intelligence that might have prevented the 9/11 attacks.<br /><br /><i>The Looming Tower</i> broadens and deepens our knowledge of these signal events by taking us behind the scenes. Here is Sayyid Qutb, founder of the modern Islamist movement, lonely and despairing as he meets Western culture up close in 1940s America; the privileged childhoods of bin Laden and Zawahiri; family life in the al-Qaeda compounds of Sudan and Afghanistan; O'Neill's high-wire act in balancing his all-consuming career with his equally entangling personal life--he was living with three women, each of them unaware of the others' existence--and the nitty-gritty of turf battles among U.S. intelligence agencies.<br /><br />Brilliantly conceived and written, <i>The Looming Tower</i> draws all elements of the story into a galvanizing narrative that adds immeasurably to our understanding of how we arrived at September 11, 2001. The richness of its new information, and the depth of its perceptions, can help us deal more wisely and effectively with the continuing terrorist threat.",

    "description": "\u201cLife in a women\u2019s prison is full of surprises,\u201d writes Cristina Rathbone in her landmark account of life at MCI-Framingham. And so it is. After two intense court battles with prison officials, Rathbone gained unprecedented access to the otherwise invisible women of the oldest running women\u2019s prison in America. <br /><br />The picture that emerges is both astounding and enraging. Women reveal the agonies of separation from family, and the prevalence of depression, and of sexual predation, and institutional malaise behind bars. But they also share their more personal hopes and concerns. There is horror in prison for sure, but Rathbone insists there is also humor and romance and downright bloody-mindedness. Getting beyond the political to the personal, <b>A World Apart</b> is both a triumph of empathy and a searing indictment of a system that has overlooked the plight of women in prison for far too long.<br /><br />At the center of the book is Denise, a mother serving five years for a first-time, nonviolent drug offense. Denise\u2019s son is nine and obsessed with Beanie Babies when she first arrives in prison. He is fourteen and in prison himself by the time she is finally released. As Denise struggles to reconcile life in prison with the realities of her son\u2019s excessive freedom on the outside, we meet women like Julie, who gets through her time by distracting herself with flirtatious, often salacious relationships with male correctional officers; Louise, who keeps herself going by selling makeup and personalized food packages on the prison black market; Chris, whose mental illness leads her to kill herself in prison; and Susan, who, after thirteen years of intermittent incarceration, has come to think of MCI-Framingham as home. Fearlessly truthful and revelatory,<b> A World Apart</b> is a major work of investigative journalism and social justice.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

For Danny, a Yale junior, it means two weeks behind the wheel of the \"Roach Coach,\" his father's lunch truck, which plies the parking lots of office parks in central New Jersey.<br /><br />But Danny can use the time behind the coffee urn to try to make sense of a love life that's gotten a little complicated. There's loyal and patient hometown honey Cindy and her recently dropped bombshell to contend with, and there's also lissome Polly back in New Haven--with her shifting moods, perfect thrift store dresses, and inconvenient liaison with a dashing professor. If girl problems aren't enough, there's the constant menace of the Lunch Monsters, a group of thugs who think Danny has planted the Roach Coach in their territory.<br /><br /><i>Joe College</i> is Tom Perrotta's warmest and funniest fiction yet, a comic journey into the dark side of love, higher education, and food service.",

Sometimes angry, sometimes irreverent, but always clear-eyed and rigorous, Easterly argues that we in the West need to face our own history of ineptitude and draw the proper conclusions, especially at a time when the question of our ability to transplant Western institutions has become one of the most pressing issues we face.",

    "description": "When Alexandra Bo Fuller was in Zambia a few years ago visiting her parents, she asked her father about a nearby banana farmer who was known as being a tough bugger. Her father's response was a warning to steer clear of him: Curiosity scibbled the cat, he told her. Nonetheless, Fuller began her strange friendhip with the man she calls K, a white African and veteran of the Rhodesian War. A man of contradictions, K is battle-scarred and work-weathered, a born-again Christian and given to weeping for the failure of his romantic life and the burden of his memories. Driven by K's these memories of the war, they decide to enter the heart of darkness in the most literal way, by travelling from Zambia through Zimbabwe and Mozambique to visit the scenes of the war and to meet other veterans. The result is a remarkably unbiased and unsentimental glimpse of life in Africa.",

When they come across a room with an old wardrobe in the corner, Lucy immediately opens the door and gets inside. To her amazement, she suddenly finds herself standing in the clearing of a wood on a winter after-noon, with snowflakes falling through the air. Lucy has found Narnia, a magical land of fauns and centaurs, nymphs and talking animals -- and the beautiful but evil White Witch, who has held the country in eternal winter for a hundred years.<br /><br />This exquisite gift edition brings a fresh look to this timeless classic and is the perfect introduction to all the wonders of Narnia.",

    "description": "A fiction-within-a-fiction, a labyrinthine edifice of funny, mournful, and harrowing meditations on the fatal impasse between a man and a woman, <b>My Life as a Man</b> is Roth's most blistering novel. <br /><br />At its heart lies the marriage of Peter and Maureen Tarnopol, a gifted young writer and the woman who wants to be his muse but who instead is his nemesis. Their union is based on fraud and shored up by moral blackmail, but it is so perversely durable that, long after Maureen's death, Peter is still trying\u2014and failing\u2014to write his way free of it. Out of desperate inventions and cauterizing truths, acts of weakness, tenderheartedness, and shocking cruelty, Philip Roth creates a work worthy of Strindberg\u2014a fierce tragedy of sexual need and blindness.",

Harry Bosch was taken off the Angella Benton murder case when the production assistant's death was linked with the violent theft of two million dollars from a movie set. Both files were never closed. Now retired from the L.A.P.D., Bosch is determined to find justice for Angella. Without a badge to open doors and strike fear into the guilty, he's on his own. And even in the face of an opponent more powerful and ruthless than any he's ever encountered, Bosch is not backing down.",

It tells of a girl named Alice falling through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre. Its narrative course and structure, characters and imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.",

    "description": "More than a decade ago, Harry Bosch worked on the case of Marie Gesto, a twenty-two-year-old who went missing but was never found. Now, with the Gesto file still on his desk, Bosch gets a call from the District Attorney: A serial killer has confessed. Did Harry miss a key clue? Or is something more going on here?<br /><br />In 1993 Marie Gesto disappeared after walking out of a supermarket. Harry Bosch worked the case but couldn't crack it, and the twenty-two-year-old was never found. Now, more than a decade later, with the Gesto file still on his desk, Bosch gets a call from the District Attorney. <br /><br />A man accused of two heinous murders is willing to come clean about several others, including the killing of Marie Gesto. Taking the confession of the man he has sought-and hated-for thirteen years is bad enough. Discovering that he missed a clue back in 1993 that could have stopped nine other murders may just be the straw that breaks Harry Bosch.",

Somehow the sweeping changes of the civil rights movement managed to bypass McIntosh entirely. It took one uneducated, unemployed black man, Thurnell Alston, to challenge the sheriff and his courthouse gang--and to change the way of life in this community forever. \"An inspiring and absorbing account of the struggle for human dignity and racial equality\" (Coretta Scott King)",

    "description": "One of the most acclaimed and beloved entertainers, Steve Martin is quickly becoming recognized as a gorgeous writer capable of being at once melancholy and tart, achingly innocent and astonishingly ironic (<em>Elle</em>). A frequent contributor to both <em>The New Yorker</em> and the <em>New York Times</em> as well as the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Pure Drivel</em>, Martin is once again poised to capture the attention of readers with his debut novella, a delightful depiction of life and love. The shopgirl is Mirabelle, a beautiful aspiring artist who pays the rent by selling gloves at the Beverly Hills Neiman Marcus. She captures the attention of Ray Porter, a wealthy, lonely businessman. As Ray and Mirabelle tentatively embark on a relationship, they both struggle to decipher the language of love--with consequences that are both comic and heartbreaking. Filled with the kind of witty, discerning observations that have brought Steve Martin incredible critical success, <em>Shopgirl</em> is a work of disarming tenderness.",

    "description": "Just before eleven on an ordinary summer night in Washington, D.C., Tucker Jones picks up the phone, expecting to hear that his teenage daughter, Kat, is back from the movies. But the caller is another parent, a man who tells Tucker that Kat was actually at a party-- and makes a shocking allegation about what happened to her there. From that moment <i>Breaking Her Fall</i> sweeps irresistibly forward to its wrenching, and redemptive, conclusion.<br /><br />In a blind rage, Tucker races to the party to find Kat already departed, but his full-boil interrogation of the boys still present spills over into a confrontation-- and ends with one of the boys crashing into a glass tabletop. In a second, his rage turns to remorse, and he soon finds himself under arrest. Tucker could easily lose his home and his business, but he is most concerned about losing his daughter.<br /><br />Stephen Goodwin writes with insight and rare power about the way that passion rearranges lives. As Tucker and Kat and everyone around them seeks to repair the damages of that night, <i>Breaking Her Fall</i> charts their uncommonly difficult passage from despair to reconciliation and hope with extraordinary grace.",

    "description": "An American imam offers answers for today's toughest questions about Islam, and a vision for a\u00a0 reconciliation between Islam and the West.<br /><br />One of the pressing questions of our time is what went wrong in the relationship between Muslims and the West. Continuing global violence in the name of Islam reflects the deepest fears by certain Muslim factions of Western political, cultural, and economic encroachment. The solution to the current antagonism requires finding common ground upon which to build mutual respect and understanding. Who better to offer such an analysis than an American imam, someone with a foot in each world and the tools to examine the common roots of both Western and Muslim cultures; someone to explain to the non-Islamic West not just what went wrong with Islam, but what's right with Islam.<br /><br />Focused on finding solutions, not on determining fault, this is ultimately a hopeful, inspiring book. <em>What's Right with Islam</em> systematically lays out the reasons for the current dissonance between these cultures and offers a foundation and plan for improved relations. Wide-ranging in scope, <em>What's Right with Islam</em> elaborates in satisfying detail a vision for a Muslim world that can eventually embrace its own distinctive forms of democracy and capitalism, aspiring to a new Cordoba - a time when Jews, Christians, Muslims, and all other faith traditions will live together in peace and prosperity.<br /><br />\u00a0<br /><br />",

    "description": "Born in 1937 in a port city a thousand miles north of Shanghai, Adeline Yen Mah was the youngest child of an affluent Chinese family who enjoyed rare privileges during a time of political and cultural upheaval. But wealth and position could not shield Adeline from a childhood of appalling emotional abuse at the hands of a cruel and manipulative Eurasian stepmother. Determined to survive through her enduring faith in family unity, Adeline struggled for independence as she moved from Hong Kong to England and eventually to the United States to become a physician and writer.<br /><br />A compelling, painful, and ultimately triumphant story of a girl's journey into adulthood, Adeline's story is a testament to the most basic of human needs: acceptance, love, and understanding. With a powerful voice that speaks of the harsh realities of growing up female in a family and society that kept girls in emotional chains, <i>Falling Leaves</i> is a work of heartfelt intimacy and a rare authentic portrait of twentieth-century China.",

    "description": "Join the movement! Four million strong and counting, hip, young chicks with sticks are putting a whole new spin on knitting--while turning last fall's <i>Stitch 'n Bitch: The Knitter's Handbook</i> into a surprise national bestseller (from <i>The New York Times</i> to the <i>L.A. Times</i> to BookSense) with 215,000 copies in print. So influential is the book that the number of Stitch 'n Bitch knitting groups tripled in the past six months--spawning a <i>Stitch 'n Bitch Nation</i>.<br /><br />Written by <i>Stitch 'n Bitch</i> author Debbie Stoller, <i>Stitch 'n Bitch Nation</i> features 50 hip, new, even funkier and more fabulous patterns by Stitch 'n Bitch designers, who come from San Francisco to Brooklyn, Chicago to Cambridge to St. Paul, Minnesota. The Om Yoga Mat Bag. Felted Monster Slippers. The London Calling Union Jack Sweater, because even punks get cold in winter. A Double-Duty Shrug. Polka Dot Tankini. That '70s Poncho. The Boob Tube. Spiderweb Capelet, Cabled Newsboy Cap, Chunky Baby Booties and Baby Bunny Hat. And the most ingenious project, a Knit-Your-Own Rock Star doll--with a choice of Joey Ramone or Henry Rollins. All designs are complete with full-color photographs and step-by-step instructions, and are made from sexy, contemporary yarns, including multicolored angora, alpaca, lace, and mohair. Includes the best tips, shortcuts, and techniques from Stitch 'n Bitchers, profiles of knitters and their groups, and a how-to refresher on all the stitches used in the book.",

So when his homicide detective brother kills himself, McEvoy copes in the only way he knows how--he decides to write the story. But his research leads him to suspect a serial killer is at work--a devious murderer who's killing cops and leaving a trail of poetic clues. It's the news story of a lifetime, if he can get the story without losing his life.",

Shipped off to Europe when they are nineteen, the boys are marginalized from the Canadian soldiers not only by their native appearance but also by the fine marksmanship that years of hunting in the bush has taught them. Both become snipers renowned for their uncanny accuracy. But while Xavier struggles to understand the purpose of the war and to come to terms with his conscience for the many lives he has ended, Elijah becomes obsessed with killing, taking great risks to become the most accomplished sniper in the army. Eventually the harrowing and bloody truth of war takes its toll on the two friends in different, profound ways. Intertwined with this account is the story of Niska, who herself has borne witness to a lifetime of death\u2014the death of her people.<br /><br /> In part inspired by the legend of Francis Pegahmagabow, the great Indian sniper of World War I, <b>Three-Day Road</b> is an impeccably researched and beautifully written story that offers a searing reminder about the cost of war.<br /><br /><br />",

    "description": "Following the best-selling triumph of Kafka on the Shore-\"daringly original,\" wrote Steven Moore in The Washington Post Book World, \"and compulsively readable\"-comes a collection that generously expresses Murakami's mastery. From the surreal to the mundane, these stories exhibit his ability to transform the full range of human experience in ways that are instructive, surprising, and relentlessly entertaining. As Richard Eder has written in the Los Angeles Times Book Review, \"He addresses the fantastic and the natural, each with the same mix of gravity and lightness.\" Here are animated crows, a criminal monkey, and an iceman, as well as the dreams that shape us and the things we might wish for. Whether during a chance reunion in Italy, a romantic exile in Greece, a holiday in Hawaii, or in the grip of everyday life, Murakami's characters confront grievous loss, or sexuality, or the glow of a firefly, or the impossible distances between those who ought to be the closest of all. \"While anyone can tell a story that resembles a dream,\" Laura Miller wrote in The New York Times Book Review, \"it's the rare artist, like this one, who can make us feel that we are dreaming it ourselves\"-a feat performed anew twenty-four times in this career-spanning book.",

    "description": "From the author of the immensely influential and best-selling <i>Of Paradise and Power\u2014</i>a major reevaluation of America\u2019s place in the world from the colonial era to the turn of the twentieth century.<br /><br />Robert Kagan strips away the myth of America\u2019s isolationist tradition and reveals a more complicated reality: that Americans have been increasing their global power and influence steadily for the past four centuries. Even from the time of the Puritans, he reveals, America was no shining \u201ccity up on a hill\u201d but an engine of commercial and territorial expansion that drove Native Americans, as well as French, Spanish, Russian, and ultimately even British power, from the North American continent. Even before the birth of the nation, Americans believed they were destined for global leadership. Underlying their ambitions, Kagan argues, was a set of ideas and ideals about the world and human nature. He focuses on the Declaration of Independence as the document that firmly established the American conviction that the inalienable rights of all mankind transcended territorial borders and blood ties. American nationalism, he shows, was always internationalist at its core. He also makes a startling discovery: that the Civil War and the abolition of slavery\u2014the fulfillment of the ideals of the Declaration\u2014were the decisive turning point in the history of American foreign policy as well. Kagan's brilliant and comprehensive reexamination of early American foreign policy makes clear why America, from its very beginning, has been viewed worldwide not only as a wellspring of political, cultural, and social revolution, but as an ambitious and, at times, dangerous nation.",

    "description": "Many thousands of readers consider Philip K. Dick the greatest science fiction mind on any planet. Since his untimely death in 1982, interest in Dick's works has continued to mount and his reputation has been further enhanced by a growing body of critical attention. The Philip K. Dick Award is now given annually to a distinguished work of science fiction, and the Philip K. Dick Society is devoted to the study and promulgation of his works.This collection includes all of the writer's earliest short and medium-length fiction (including some previously unpublished stories) covering the years 1952-1955. These fascinating stories include Second Variety, Foster, You're Dead and The Father-Thing, and many others.<br /><br />\"A useful acquisition for any serious SF library or collection.\" -- Kirkus<br /><br />\"The collected stories of Philip K. Dick is awe inspiring.\" -- The Washington Post<br /><br />\"More than anyone else in the field, Mr. Dick really puts you inside people's minds.\" -- Wall Street Journal",

    "description": "<b>The 9/11 Report for Every American</b><br />On December 5, 2005, the 9/11 Commission issued its final report card on the government\u2019s fulfillment of the recommendations issued in July 2004: one A, twelve Bs, nine Cs, twelve Ds, three Fs, and four incompletes. Here is stunning evidence that Sid Jacobson and Ernie Col\u00f3n, with more than sixty years of experience in the comic-book industry between them, were right: far, far too few Americans have read, grasped, and demanded action on the Commission\u2019s investigation into the events of that tragic day and the lessons America must learn.<br /><br />Using every skill and storytelling method Jacobson and Col\u00f3n have learned over the decades, they have produced the most accessible version of the 9/11 Report. Jacobson\u2019s text frequently follows word for word the original report, faithfully captures its investigative thoroughness, and covers its entire scope, even including the Commission\u2019s final report card. Col\u00f3n\u2019s stunning artwork powerfully conveys the facts, insights, and urgency of the original. Published on the fifth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the United States, an event that has left no aspect of American foreign or domestic policy untouched, <i>The 9/11 Report </i>puts at every American\u2019s fingertips the most defining event of the century.",

    "description": "<i>Fat City</i> is a novel about the indestructibility of of hope, the anguish and comedy of the human condition. It tells the story of two young boxers out of Stockton, California: Ernie Munger and Billy Tully, one in his late teens, the other just turning thirty, whose seemingly parallel lives intersect for a time. Set in an ambiance of glittering dreams and drab realities, it tells of the two fighters' struggles to escape the confinements of their existence, and of the men and women in their world. <i>Fat City</i> is a novel about the sporting life like no other ever written: without melodrama or false heroics, written with a truthfulness that is at once painful and beautiful.<br /><br /><i>Denis Johnson:</i> \"Between the ages of 19 and 25 I studied Leonard Gardner\u2019s book so closely that I began to fear I\u2019d never be able to write anything but imitations of it, so I swore it off(...)When I was about 34 (the same age Gardner was when he published his), my first novel came out. About a year later I borrowed <i>Fat City</i> from the library and read it. I could see immediately that ten years\u2019 exile hadn\u2019t saved me from the influence of its perfection \u2014 I\u2019d taught myself to write in Gardner\u2019s style, though not as well. And now, many years later, it\u2019s still true: Leonard Gardner has something to say in every word I write.\"<br /><br /><i>Joan Didion:</i> \"Leonard Gardner's <i>Fat City</i> affected me more than any new fiction I have read in a long while, and I do not think it affected me only because I come from Fat City, or somewhere near it. He has got it exactly right--the hanging around gas stations, the field dust, the relentless oppressiveness of the weather, the bleak liaisons sealed on the levees and Greyhound buses--but he has done more than just get it down, he has made it a metaphor for the joyless in heart.\"<br /><br /><i>David Wagoner:</i> \"The people he writes about are alive and three-dimensional, and have that meaty, sweaty immediacy I admire in novels and find so seldom. It's an odd, interesting world he explores here--as tense and vivid as the prose.\"<br /><br /><i>Ivan Gold:</i> \"Gardner writes with power, with an insider's knowledge, and with a vividness and love for his characters which redeem them even when they're lost and beaten.\"<br /><br /><i>Harry Mark Petrakis:</i> \"A man of real talent. He makes the savage world he writes of come alive to the point where the reader can smell the sweat, and feel the anguish of unremitting failure.\"<br /><br />Ross Macdonald: \"In his pity and art Gardner moves beyond race, beyond guilt and punishment, as Twain and Melville did, into a tragic forgiveness. I have seldom read a novel as beautiful and individual as this one.\"<br /><br /><br />Originally published in 1969, Fat City is an American classic whose stature has increased over the years. Made into an acclaimed film by John Huston, the book is set in and around Stockton, California.",

It sounds like a standard case. The only problem is that Bob and Fred are the same person. Substance D doesn\u2019t just alter the mind, it splits it in two, and neither side knows what the other is doing or that it even exists. Now, both sides are growing increasingly paranoid as Bob tries to evade Fred while Fred tries to evade his suspicious bosses.<br /><br />In this award-winning novel, friends can become enemies, good trips can turn terrifying, and cops and criminals are two sides of the same coin. Dick is at turns caustically funny and somberly contemplative, fashioning a novel that is as unnerving as it is enthralling.",

    "description": "Mary Lawson's debut novel is a shimmering tale of love, death and redemption set in a rural northern community where time has stood still. Tragic, funny and unforgettable, this deceptively simple masterpiece about the perils of hero worship leapt to the top of the bestseller lists only days after being released in Canada and earned glowing reviews in <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> and <i>The</i> <i>Globe and Mail</i>, to name a few. It will be published in more than a dozen countries worldwide, including the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Italy and Bulgaria.<br /><br />Luke, Matt, Kate and Bo Morrison are born in an Ontario farming community of only a few families, so isolated that \u201cthe road led only south.\u201d There is little work, marriage choices are few, and the winter cold seeps into the bones of all who dare to live there. In the Morrisons\u2019 hard-working, Presbyterian house, the Eleventh Commandment is \u201cThou Shalt Not Emote.\u201d But as descendants of a great-grandmother who \u201cfixed a book rest to her spinning wheel so that she could read while she was spinning,\u201d the Morrison children have some hope of getting off the land through the blessings of education. Luke, the eldest, is accepted at teachers college \u2013 despite having struggle mightily through school \u2013 but before he can enroll, the Morrison parents are killed in a collision with a logging truck. He gives up his place to stay home and raise his younger sisters -- seven-year-old Kate, and Bo, still a baby.<br /><br />In this family bound together by loss, the closest relationship is that between Kate and her older brother Matt, who love to wander off to the ponds together and lie on the bank, noses to the water. Matt teaches his little sister to watch \u201cdamselflies performing their delicate iridescent dances,\u201d to understand how water beetles \u201ccarry down an air bubble with them when they submerge.\u201d The life in the pond is one that seems to go on forever, in contrast to the abbreviated lives of the Morrison parents. Matt becomes Kate\u2019s hero and her guide, as his passionate interest in the natural world sparks an equal passion in Kate.<br /><br />Matt, a true scholar, is expected to fulfill the family dream by becoming the first Morrison to earn a university degree. But a dramatic event changes his course, and he ends up a farmer; so it is Kate who eventually earns the doctorate and university teaching position. She is never able to reconcile her success with what she considers the tragedy of Matt\u2019s failure, and she feels a terrible guilt over the sacrifices made for her. Now a successful biologist in her twenties, she nervously returns home with her partner, a microbiologist from an academic family, to celebrate Matt\u2019s son\u2019s birthday. Amid the clash of cultures, Kate takes us in and out of her troubled childhood memories. Accustomed to dissecting organisms under a microscope, she must now analyze her own emotional life. She is still in turmoil over the events of one fateful year when the tragedy of another local family spilled over into her own. There are things she cannot understand or forgive.<br /><br />In this universal drama of family love and misunderstandings, Lawson ratchets up the tension, her narrative flowing with consummate control in ever-increasing circles, overturning one\u2019s expectations to the end. Compared by <i>Publishers Weekly </i>to Richard Ford for her lyrical, evocative writing, Lawson combines deeply drawn characters, beautiful writing and a powerful description of the land.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

The bestselling author of <i>The Plot Against America</i> now turns his attention from \"one family's harrowing encounter with history\" (<i>New York Times</i>) to one man's lifelong skirmish with mortality.<br /><br />The fate of Roth's everyman is traced from his first shocking confrontation with death on the idyllic beaches of his childhood summers, through the family trials and professional achievements of his vigorous adulthood, and into his old age, when he is rended by observing the deterioration of his contemporaries and stalked by his own physical woes.<br /><br />The terrain of this powerful novel is the human body. Its subject is the common experience that terrifies us all.",

    "description": "<i>American Prometheus</i> is the first full-scale biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer, \"father of the atomic bomb,\" the brilliant, charismatic physicist who led the effort to capture the awesome fire of the sun for his country in time of war. Immediately after Hiroshima, he became the most famous scientist of his generation-one of the iconic figures of the twentieth century, the embodiment of modern man confronting the consequences of scientific progress. <br /><br />He was the author of a radical proposal to place international controls over atomic materials-an idea that is still relevant today. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb and criticized the Air Force's plans to fight an infinitely dangerous nuclear war. In the now almost-forgotten hysteria of the early 1950s, his ideas were anathema to powerful advocates of a massive nuclear buildup, and, in response, Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss, Superbomb advocate Edward Teller and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover worked behind the scenes to have a hearing board find that Oppenheimer could not be trusted with America's nuclear secrets. <br />American Prometheus sets forth Oppenheimer's life and times in revealing and unprecedented detail. Exhaustively researched, it is based on thousands of records and letters gathered from archives in America and abroad, on massive FBI files and on close to a hundred interviews with Oppenheimer's friends, relatives and colleagues.<br /><br />We follow him from his earliest education at the turn of the twentieth century at New York City's Ethical Culture School, through personal crises at Harvard and Cambridge universities. Then to Germany, where he studied quantum physics with the world's most accomplished theorists; and to Berkeley, California, where he established, during the 1930s, the leading American school of theoretical physics, and where he became deeply involved with social justice causes and their advocates, many of whom were communists. Then to Los Alamos, New Mexico, where he transformed a bleak mesa into the world's most potent nuclear weapons laboratory-and where he himself was transformed. And finally, to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, which he directed from 1947 to 1966. <br /><br /><i>American Prometheus</i> is a rich evocation of America at midcentury, a new and compelling portrait of a brilliant, ambitious, complex and flawed man profoundly connected to its major events\u2014the Depression, World War II and the Cold War. It is at once biography and history, and essential to our understanding of our recent past\u2014and of our choices for the future.",

    "description": "In a volume he describes as \"a series of covert and not-so-covert autobiographical pieces,\" Jonathan Lethem explores the nature of cultural obsession--from western films and comic books, to the music of Pink Floyd and the New York City subway. Along the way, he shows how each of these \"voyages out from himself\" has led him to the source of his beginnings as a writer. <i>The Disappointment Artist</i> is a series of windows onto the collisions of art, landscape, and personal history that formed Lethem's richly imaginative, searingly honest perspective on life. A touching, deeply perceptive portrait of a writer in the making.",

    "description": "At its heart, the story is all too simple: a man and his son take a lengthy motorcycle trip through America. But this is not a simple trip at all, for around every corner, through mountain and desert, wind and rain, and searing heat and biting cold, their pilgrimage leads them to new vistas of self-discovery and renewal.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Mantenance</i> is an elemental work that has helped to shape and define the past twenty-five years of American culture. This special audio edition presents this adventure in a compelling way - for the millions who have already taken this journey and want to travel these roads again, and for the many more who will discover for the first time the wonders and challenges of a journey that will change the way they think and feel about their lives.",

Trouble is, when Philip Marlowe asks Lavery about it he denies everything and sends the private investigator packing with a flea lodged firmly in his ear. But when Marlowe next encounters Lavery, he's denying nothing on account of the two bullet holes in his heart. Now Marlowe's on the trail of a killer, who leads him out of smoggy LA all the way to a murky mountain lake.",

Here we meet young George Willard, a newspaper reporter with dreams; Kate Swift, the schoolteacher who attempts to seduce him; Wing Biddlebaum, a berry picker whose hands are the source of both his renown and shame; Alice Hindman, who has one last adventure; and all the other complex human beings whose portraits brought American literature into the modern age. Their stories make up a classic and place its author alongside the best of American writers.<br /><br />With an Introduction by Irving Howe<br />and an Afterword by Dean Koontz<br />",

    "description": "In <b>Skipping Towards Gomorrah</b>, Dan Savage eviscerates the right-wing conservatives as he commits each of the Seven Deadly Sins himself (or tries to) and finds those everyday Americans who take particular delight in their sinful pursuits. Among them:<br />Greed: Gamblers reveal secrets behind outrageous fortune.<br /><br /><br />Lust: \"We're swingers!\"-you won't believe who's doing it.<br /><br /><br />Anger: Texans shoot off some rounds and then listen to Dan fire off on his own about guns, gun control, and the Second Amendment.<br /><br /><br />Combine a unique history of the Seven Deadly Sins, a new interpretation of the biblical stories of Sodom and Gomorrah, and enough Bill Bennett, Robert Bork, Pat Buchanan, Dr. Laura, and Bill O'Reilly bashing to more than make up for their incessant carping, and you've got the most provocative book of the fall.",

But Verlyn Klinkenborg has done just that in <i>Timothy</i>: an insightful and utterly engaging story of the world\u2019s most famous tortoise, whose real life was observed by the eighteenth-century English curate and naturalist Gilbert White. For thirteen years, Timothy lived in White\u2019s garden. Here Klinkenborg gives the tortoise an unforgettable voice and keen powers of observation on both human and natural affairs. Wry and wise, unexpectedly moving and enchanting at every\u2013careful\u2013turn, <i>Timothy</i> surprises and delights.",

    "description": "<i>My Detachment</i> is a war story like none you have ever read before, an unromanticized portrait of a young man coming of age in the controversial war that defined a generation. In an astonishingly honest, comic, and moving account of his tour of duty in Vietnam, master storyteller Tracy Kidder writes for the first time about himself. This extraordinary memoir is destined to become a classic.<br /><br />Kidder was an ROTC intelligence officer, just months out of college and expecting a stateside assignment, when his orders arrived for Vietnam. There, lovesick, anxious, and melancholic, he tried to assume command of his detachment, a ragtag band of eight more-or-less ungovernable men charged with reporting on enemy radio locations.<br /><br />He eventually learned not only to lead them but to laugh and drink with them as they shared the boredom, pointlessness, and fear of war. Together, they sought a ghostly enemy, homing in on radio transmissions and funneling intelligence gathered by others. Kidder realized that he would spend his time in Vietnam listening in on battle but never actually experiencing it.<br /><br />With remarkable clarity and with great detachment, Kidder looks back at himself from across three and a half decades, confessing how, as a young lieutenant, he sought to borrow from the tragedy around him and to imagine himself a romantic hero. Unrelentingly honest, rueful, and revealing, <i>My Detachment</i> gives us war without heroism, while preserving those rare moments of redeeming grace in the midst of lunacy and danger. The officers and men of <i>My Detachment</i> are not the sort of people who appear in war movies\u2013they are the ones who appear only in war, and they are unforgettable.",

Several miles uptown and perched near the top of the Upper East Side\u2019s social register, Luke McGavock has postponed his accumulation of wealth in an attempt to recover the sense of purpose now lacking in a life that often gives him pause. But on a September morning, brightness falls horribly from the sky, and people worlds apart suddenly find themselves working side by side at the devastated site.Wise, surprising, and, ultimately, heart-stoppingly redemptive, <i>The Good Life</i> captures lives that allow us to see\u2013through personal, social, and moral complexity\u2013more clearly into the heart of things.",

    "description": "The Decameron (c.1351) is an entertaining series of one hundred stories written in the wake of the Black Death. The stories are told in a country villa outside the city of Florence by ten young noble men and women who are seeking to escape the ravages of the plague. Boccaccio's skill as a dramatist is masterfully displayed in these vivid portraits of people from all stations in life, with plots that revel in a bewildering variety of human reactions.<br /><br />Translated with an Introduction and Notes by G. H. McWilliam",

    "description": "Over and again, the aged seeress Tamis scried all the possible tomorrows. In every one, dark forces threatened Greece; terrible evil was poised to reenter the world. The future held only one hope: a half-caste Spartan boy, Parmenion. So Tamis made it her mission to see that Parmenion would before the deadliest warrior in the world -- no matter what the cost.<br />Raised to manhood in Sparta, bullied and forced to fight for his life every day, Parmenion had no notion of the unseen dimensions of magic and mystery that shaped his fate. He grew in strength and cunning. His military genius earned him the title Strategos in Sparta. His triumphs for the city of Thebes made him a hero. And finally his fate led him to the service of Philip of Macedon.<br />As Tamis had foreseen, Parmenion's destiny was tied to the Dark God, to Philip, and to the yet-unborn Alexander. All too soon the future was upon them. Parmenion stood poised to defeat evil -- or to open the gate for the Dark God to reenter the world.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",

    "description": "Nothing in the annals of sports has aroused more passion than the heavyweight fights in New York in 1936 and 1938 between Joe Louis and Max Schmeling \u2014 bouts that symbolized the hopes, hatreds, and fears of a world moving toward total war. Acclaimed journalist David Margolick takes us into the careers of both men \u2014 a black American and a Nazi German hero \u2014 and depicts the extraordinary buildup to their legendary 1938 rematch. Vividly capturing the outpouring of emotion that the two fighters brought forth, Margolick brilliantly illuminates the cultural and social divisions that they came to represent.",

    "description": "In <em>Restless Giant</em>, acclaimed historical author James Patterson provides a crisp, concise assessment of the twenty-seven years between the resignation of Richard Nixon and the election of George W. Bush in a sweeping narrative that seamlessly weaves together social, cultural, political, economic, and international developments. We meet the era's many memorable figures and explore the \"culture wars\" between liberals and conservatives that appeared to split the country in two.<br /><br />Patterson describes how America began facing bewildering developments in places such as Panama, Somalia, Bosnia, and Iraq, and discovered that it was far from easy to direct the outcome of global events, and at times even harder for political parties to reach a consensus over what attempts should be made. At the same time, domestic issues such as the persistence of racial tensions, high divorce rates, alarm over crime, and urban decay led many in the media to portray the era as one of decline. Patterson offers a more positive perspective, arguing that, despite our often unmet expectations, we were in many ways better off than we thought. By 2000, most Americans lived more comfortably than they had in the 1970s, and though bigotry and discrimination were far from extinct, a powerful rights consciousness insured that these were less pervasive in American life than at any time in the past.<br /><br />With insightful analyses and engaging prose, <em>Restless Giant</em> captures this period of American history in a way that no other book has, illuminating the road that the United States traveled from the dismal days of the mid-1970s through the hotly contested election of 2000.<br /><br /><strong>The Oxford History of the United States</strong><br /> The Oxford History of the United States is the most respected multi-volume history of our nation. The series includes three Pulitzer Prize winners, a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, and winners of the Bancroft and Parkman Prizes. <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em> has praised it as \"the most distinguished series in American historical scholarship,\" a series that \"synthesizes a generation's worth of historical inquiry and knowledge into one literally state-of-the-art book.\" Conceived under the general editorship of C. Vann Woodward and Richard Hofstadter, and now under the editorship of David M. Kennedy, this renowned series blends social, political, economic, cultural, diplomatic, and military history into coherent and vividly written narrative.<br />",

    "description": "He is a man of many names. Some call him the Golden One; others, the Lord of the Silver Bow. To the Dardanians, he is Prince Aeneas. But to his friends, he is <b>Helikaon</b>. Strong, fast, quick of mind, he is a bold warrior, hated by his enemies, feared even by his Trojan allies. For there is a darkness at the heart of the Golden One, a savagery that, once awakened, can be appeased only with blood.<br /><br /><b>Argurios</b> the Mykene is a peerless fighter, a man of unbending principles and unbreakable will. Like all of the Mykene warriors, he lives to conquer and to kill. Dispatched by King Agamemnon to scout the defenses of the golden city of Troy, he is Helikaon's sworn enemy.<br /><br /><b>Andromache</b> is a priestess of Thera betrothed against her will to Hektor, prince of Troy. Scornful of tradition, skilled in the arts of war, and passionate in the ways of her order, Andromache vows to love whom she pleases and to live as she desires.<br /><br />Now fate is about to thrust these three together; and, from the sparks of passionate love and hate, ignite a fire that will engulf the world.<br /><br />Readers who know the works of David Gemmell expect nothing less than excellence from this author, whose taut prose, driving plots, and full-bodied characters have won him legions of fans the world over. Now, with this first masterly volume in an epic reimagining of the Trojan War, Gemmell has written an ageless drama of brave deeds and fierce battles, of honor and treachery, of love won and lost.<br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

In the course of pursuing each other's ruin, they will deploy all the deception their magicians' craft can command--the highest misdirection and the darkest science.<br /><br />Blood will be spilled, but it will not be enough.

Ender himself refuses to return to the planet, but his crew has gone home to their families, scattered across the globe. The battle school is no more.<br /><br />But with the external threat gone, the Earth has become a battlefield once more. The children of the Battle School are more than heroes; they are potential weapons that can bring power to the countries that control them. One by one, all of Ender's Dragon Army are kidnapped. Only Bean escapes; and he turns for help to Ender's brother Peter.<br /><br />Peter Wiggin, Ender's older brother, has already been manipulating the politics of Earth from behind the scenes. With Bean's help, he will eventually rule the world.",

    "description": "<i>Paradise Lost</i> remains as challenging and relevant today as it was in the turbulent intellectual and political environment in which it was written. This edition aims to bring the poem as fully alive to a modern reader as it would have been to Milton's contemporaries. It provides a newly edited text of the 1674 edition of the poem--the last of Milton's lifetime--with carefully modernized spelling and punctuation. Marginal glosses define unfamiliar words, and extensive annotations at the foot of the page clarify Milton's syntax and poetics, and explore the range of literary, biblical, and political allusions that point to his major concerns. David Kastan's lively Introduction considers the central interpretative issues raised by the poem, demonstrating how thoroughly it engaged the most vital--and contested--issues of Milton's time, and which reveal themselves as no less vital, and perhaps no less contested, today.<br /><br />The edition also includes an essay on the text, a chronology of major events in Milton's life, and a selected bibliography, as well as the first known biography of Milton, written by Edward Phillips in 1694.",

    "description": "Throughout a single day in 1892, John Shawnessy recalls the great moments of his life\u0097from the love affairs of his youth in Indiana, to the battles of the Civil War, to the politics of the Gilded Age, to his homecoming as schoolteacher, husband, and father. Shawnessy is the epitome of the place and period in which he lives, a rural land of springlike women,\u00a0shady gamblers, wandering vagabonds,\u00a0and soapbox orators. Yet here on the banks of the Shawmucky River, which weaves its primitive course through Raintree County,\u00a0Indiana, he also feels and obeys ancient rhythms. A number-one bestseller when it was first published in 1948, this powerful novel is a compelling vision of 19th-century America with timeless resonance.",

He knew he could not survive through strength; he used his tactical genius to gain acceptance into a children's gang, and then to help make that gang a template for success for all the others. He civilized them, and lived to grow older. Then he was discovered by the recruiters for the Battle School.",

Failing to make any new friends, she writes letters compulsively, and the highlight of her day is the sound of the morning post being delivered. Maggie gradually becomes obsessed with the married couple, Libby and David, living next door. Libby has given up work after having a baby, and is finding life as a full-time mother very difficult. Just as she persuades David that she should return to work, he is asked to take a sabbatical from his management-consultant job. He's always longed to travel, and convinces Libby that they should spend six months in Cuba, learning Spanish. Maggie, deciding she too wants to travel, follows them to Havana, where the horrors of her past - in particular her young sister's violent death - begin to haunt her. And as Maggie starts to break down, she tries to take over Libby's life...",

    "description": "With high black humor, a visiting Spanish lecturer bends his gaze over that most British of institutions, Oxford University. In <i>All Souls</i>, our narrator, a visiting Spanish lecturer, viewing Oxford through a prismatic detachment, is alternately amused, puzzled, delighted, and disgusted by its vagaries of human vanity. A bit lonely, not always able to see his charming but very married mistress, he casts about for activity; he barely has to teach. His stay of two years, he recalls, involved duties which \"were practically nil\" -- \"Oxford is, without a doubt, one of the cities in the world where least work gets done, where simply being is far more important than doing or even acting.\" Yet so much goes into that simply being: friendship, opinion-mongering, one-upmanship, finicky exchanges of favors, gossip, adultery, book-collecting, back-patting, back-stabbing. Marias has a sweet tooth for eccentricity, and his novel \"crackles with deliciously sly observations of Oxford mores,\" as James Woodall noted in the <i>Independent</i>. And yet further, <i>All Souls</i> is a story of love within \"a mysterious narrative,\" as <i>The New Statesman noted</i>, within \"a turmoil of choreographical stories.\"",

    "description": "Known for his meaty seriocomic novels, Tom Robbins\u2019s shorter work has appeared in publications ranging from <i>Esquire</i> to <i>Harper\u2019s</i>, from <i>Playboy</i> to the <i>New York Times</i>. Collected here for the first time in paperback, the essays, articles, observations\u2014and even some untypical country-music lyrics\u2014offer a rare overview of the eclectic sensibility of an American original.<b> <br /><br /></b>Whether rocking with the Doors, depoliticizing Picasso\u2019s <i>Guernica,</i> lamenting the angst-ridden state of contemporary literature, or drooling over tomato sandwiches and a species of womanhood he calls \u201cthe genius waitress,\u201d Tom Robbins\u2019s briefer writings exhibit the five traits that perhaps best characterize his novels: an imaginative wit, a cheerfully brash disregard for convention, a sweetly nasty eroticism, a mystical but keenly observant eye, and an irrepressible love of language. Embedded in this primarily journalistic compilation are brand-new short stories, a sheaf of largely unpublished poems, and an offbeat assessment of our divided nation. Wherever you open <b>Wild Ducks Flying Backward</b><i>,</i> you\u2019ll encounter the serious playfulness that percolates from the mind of a self-described \u201cromantic Zen hedonist\u201d and \u201cstray dog in the banquet halls of culture.\u201d",

    "description": "Following All the Pretty Horses in Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy is a novel whose force of language is matched only by its breadth of experience and depth of thought.<br /><br />In the bootheel of New Mexico hard on the frontier, Billy and Boyd Parham are just boys in the years before the Second World War, but on the cusp of unimaginable events. First comes a trespassing Indian and the dream of wolves running wild amongst the cattle lately brought onto the plain by settlers -- this when all the wisdom of trappers has disappeared along with the trappers themselves. And so Billy sets forth at the age of sixteen on an unwitting journey into the souls of boys and animals and men. Having trapped a she-wolf he would restore to the mountains of Mexico, he is long gone and returns to find everything he left behind transformed utterly in his absence. Except his kid brother, Boyd, with whom he strikes out yet again to reclaim what is theirs thus crossing into \"that antique gaze from whence there could be no way back forever.\"<br /><br />An essential novel by any measure, The Crossing is luminous and appalling, a book that touches, stops, and starts the heart and mind at once.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",

With his acclaimed wit and acuity, Thomas Frank answers the riddle by examining his home state, Kansas-a place once famous for its radicalism that now ranks among the nation's most eager participants in the culture wars. Charting what he calls the \"thirty-year backlash\"-the popular revolt against a supposedly liberal establishment-Frank reveals how conservatism, once a marker of class privilege, became the creed of millions of ordinary Americans.<br /><br />A brilliant analysis-and funny to boot-<i>What's the Matter with Kansas?</i> is a vivid portrait of an upside-down world where blue-collar patriots recite the Pledge while they strangle their life chances; where small farmers cast their votes for a Wall Street order that will eventually push them off their land; and where a group of frat boys, lawyers, and CEOs has managed to convince the country that it speaks on behalf of the People.<br /></div>",

The bullies have made him their favorite target, his best (and only) friend seems headed for the dark side (sports and popularity), and his pregnant mother and the step-fascist are eagerly awaiting the birth of the alien life form known as Fanboy\u2019s new little brother or sister.<br /><br />Fanboy, though, has a secret: a graphic novel he\u2019s been working on without telling anyone, a graphic novel that he is convinced will lead to publication, fame, and\u2014most important of all\u2014a way out of the crappy little town he lives in and all the people that make it hell for him.<br /><br />When Fanboy meets Kyra, a.k.a. Goth Girl, he finds an outrageous, cynical girl who shares his love of comics as well as his hatred for jocks and bullies. Fanboy can\u2019t resist someone who actually seems to understand him, and soon he finds himself willing to heed her advice\u2014to ignore or crush anyone who stands in his way.",

A glossary of seventeenth-century English terms, and indexes of persons, subjects, and scriptural passages help make this the most thoughtfully conceived edition of <i>Leviathan</i> available.",

    "description": "<p><em>a selection from the beginning of the first section in </em>Book I:?</p> <p>\n  <b>THE MELODIOUS CHILD DEAD IN ME LONG BEFORE THE AX CHOPS OFF MY HEAD </b>\n</p> <p>Genet is related to that family of people who are nowadays referred to by the barbaric name of <i>pass?istes</i>. 1 An accident riveted him to a childhood memory, and this memory became sacred. In his early childhood, a liturgical drama was performed, a drama of which he was the officiant: he knew paradise and lost it, he was a child and was driven from his childhood. No doubt this \"break\" is not easy to localize. It shifts back and forth, at the dictate of his moods and myths, between the ages of ten and fifteen. But that is unimportant. What matters is that it exists and that he believes in it. His life is divided into two heterogeneous parts: before and after the sacred drama. Indeed, it is not unusual for the memory to condense into a single mythical moment the contingencies and perpetual rebeginnings of an individual history. What matters is that Genet lives and continues to relive this period of his life as if it had lasted only an instant.</p> <p>____________________ </p> <p> </p><p> </p><p>\n  1</p> <p><i>Pass?iste:</i> one who is not adapted to the present age, who is not a man of his time, who \"lives in the past.\"--Translator's note. </p><br /><p></p> <p></p> <p>____________________ </p> <p><br />?</p> <p>?</p> <p>To say <i>\"instant\"</i> is to say <i>fatal instant</i>. The instant is the reciprocal and contradictory envelopment of the before by the after. One is still what one is going to cease to be and already what one is going to become. One lives one's death, one dies one's life. One feels oneself to be one's own self and another; the eternal is present in an atom of duration. In the midst of the fullest life, one has a foreboding that one will merely survive, one is afraid of the future. It is the time of anguish and of heroism, of pleasure and of destruction. An instant is sufficient to destroy, to enjoy, to kill, to be killed, to make one's fortune at the turn of a card. Genet carries in his heart a bygone instant which has lost none of its virulence, an infinitesimal and sacred void which concludes a death and begins a horrible metamorphosis. The argument of this liturgical drama is as follows: a child dies of shame; a hoodlum rises up in his place; the hoodlum will be haunted by the child. One would have to speak of resurrection, to evoke the old initiatory rites of shamanism and secret societies, were it not that Genet refuses categorically to be a man who has been resuscitated. 2 There was a death, that is all. And Genet is nothing other than a dead man. If he appears to be still alive, it is with the larval existence which certain peoples ascribe to their defunct in the grave. All his heroes have died at least once in their life. </p> <p>\"After his first murder, Querelle experienced the feeling of being dead. . . . His human form--what is called the envelope of flesh-continued nevertheless to move about on the surface of the earth.\" </p> <p>His works are filled with meditations on death. The peculiarity of these spiritual exercises is that they almost never concern his future death, his being-to-die, but rather his being-dead, his death as past event. </p> <p>This original crisis also appears to him as a metamorphosis. The well-behaved child is suddenly transformed into a hoodlum, as Gregor Samsa was changed into a bug. Genet's attitude toward this metamorphosis is ambivalent: he both loathes it and yearns for it. </p>",

    "description": "For two decades <i>NPR</i> commentator Andrei Codrescu has been living in and writing about his adopted city, where, as he puts it, the official language is dreams. How apt that a refugee born in Transylvania found his home in a place where vampires roam the streets and voodoo queens live around the corner; where cemeteries are the most popular picnic spots, the ghosts of poets, prostitutes, and pirates are palpable, and in the French Quarter, no one ever sleeps.<br /><br /> Codrescu's essays have been called \"satirical gems,\" \"subversive,\" \"sardonic and stunning,\" \"funny,\" \"gonzo,\" \"wittily poignant,\" and \"perverse\"\u2014here is a writer who perfectly mirrors the wild, voluptuous, bohemian character of New Orleans itself. This retrospective follows him from newcomer to near native: first seduced by the lush banana trees in his backyard and the sensual aroma of coffee at the caf\u00e9 down the block, Codrescu soon becomes a Window Gang regular at the infamous bar Molly's on Decatur, does a stint as King of Krewe de Vieux Carr\u00e9 at Mardi Gras, befriends artists, musicians, and eccentrics, and exposes the city\u2019s underbelly of corruption, warning presciently about the lack of planning for floods in a city high on its own insouciance. Alas, as we all now know, Paradise is lost.<br /><br /><i>New Orleans, Mon Amour</i> is an epic love song, a clear-eyed elegy, a cultural celebration, and a thank-you note to New Orleans in its Golden Age.",

    "description": "D. H. Lawrence's Women in Love - 'the beginning of a new world', as he called it - suffered in the course of its revision, transcription, and publication some of the most spectacular damage ever inflicted upon one of his books. Until now no text of Women in Love has ever been published which is faithful to all of Lawrence's revisions. This edition, edited by scholars in England and America, clears the text of literally thousands of accumulated errors allowing its readers to read and understand the novelist's work as he himself created it. The edition includes the 'Foreword' Lawrence wrote in 1919 and two preliminary and discarded chapters which have attracted widespread critical and biographical discussion. The introduction gives a full history of the novel's composition, revision, publication and reception, and notes explain allusions and references; the textual apparatus records all variants between the base-text and the first printed editions.",

The tales were collated and edited by JRR Tolkien\u2019s son and literary heir, Christopher Tolkien, who provides a short commentary on each story, helping the reader to fill in the gaps and put each story into the context of the rest of his father\u2019s writings.",

    "description": "In her exuberant new work, Marion Meade presents a portrait of four extraordinary writers-Dorothy Parker, Zelda Fitzgerald, Edna St.Vincent Millay, and Edna Ferber- whose loves, lives, and literary endeavors embodied the spirit of the 1920s. <br /><br />These literary heroines did what they wanted and said what they thought, living wholly in the moment. They kicked open the door for twentieth-century women writers and set a new model for every woman trying to juggle the serious issues of economic independence, political power, and sexual freedom. Here are the social and literary triumphs and inevitably the penances paid: crumbled love affairs, abortions, depression, lost beauty, nervous breakdowns, and finally, overdoses and even madness. <br /><br />A vibrant mixture of literary scholarship, social history, and scandal, Bobbed Hair and Bathtub Gin is a rich evocation of a period that will forever intrigue and captivate us. <br /><br />",

    "description": "Few writers distinguish themselves by their ability to write about complicated, even obscure topics clearly and engagingly. In <i>Chaos</i>, James Gleick, a former science writer for the <i>New York Times</i>, shows that he resides in this exclusive category. Here he takes on the job of depicting the first years of the study of chaos--the seemingly random patterns that characterise many natural phenomena.<p> This is not a purely technical book. Instead, it focuses as much on the scientists studying chaos as on the chaos itself. In the pages of Gleick's book, the reader meets dozens of extraordinary and eccentric people. For instance, Mitchell Feigenbaum, who constructed and regulated his life by a 26-hour clock and watched his waking hours come in and out of phase with those of his coworkers at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p><p> As for chaos itself, Gleick does an outstanding job of explaining the thought processes and investigative techniques that researchers bring to bear on chaos problems. Rather than attempt to explain Julia sets, Lorenz attractors and the Mandelbrot Set with gigantically complicated equations, Chaos relies on sketches, photographs and Gleick's wonderful descriptive prose. --<i>Christine Buttery</i></p>",

    "description": "An illuminating portrayal of Richard Feynman\u2014a giant of twentieth century physics\u2014from his childhood tinkering with radios, to his vital work on the Manhattan Project and beyond<br /><br />Raised in Depression-era Rockaway Beach, physicist Richard Feynman was irreverent, eccentric, and childishly enthusiastic\u2014a new kind of scientist in a field that was in its infancy. His quick mastery of quantum mechanics earned him a place at Los Alamos working on the Manhattan Project under J. Robert Oppenheimer, where the giddy young man held his own among the nation\u2019s greatest minds. There, Feynman turned theory into practice, culminating in the Trinity test, on July 16, 1945, when the Atomic Age was born. He was only twenty-seven. And he was just getting started.<br /><br />In this sweeping biography, James Gleick captures the forceful personality of a great man, integrating Feynman\u2019s work and life in a way that is accessible to laymen and fascinating for the scientists who follow in his footsteps.",

    "description": "\u201cMy parents suck ass. Banning me from the phone and restricting my computer privileges are the most tyrannical parental gestures I can think of. Don\u2019t they realize that Hope\u2019s the only one who keeps me sane? I don\u2019t see how things could get any worse.\u201d<br /><br />When her best friend, Hope Weaver, moves away from Pineville, New Jersey, hyperobservant sixteen-year-old Jessica Darling is devastated. A fish out of water at school and a stranger at home, Jessica feels more lost than ever now that the only person with whom she could really communicate has gone. How is she supposed to deal with the boy- and shopping-crazy girls at school, her dad\u2019s obsession with her track meets, her mother salivating over big sister Bethany\u2019s lavish wedding, and her nonexistent love life?<br /><br />A fresh, funny, utterly compelling fiction debut by first-time novelist Megan McCafferty, <b>Sloppy Firsts</b> is an insightful, true-to-life look at Jessica\u2019s predicament as she embarks on another year of teenage torment--from the dark days of Hope\u2019s departure through her months as a type-A personality turned insomniac to her completely mixed-up feelings about Marcus Flutie, the intelligent and mysterious \u201cDreg\u201d who works his way into her heart. Like a John Hughes for the twenty-first century, Megan McCafferty taps into the inherent humor and drama of the teen experience. This poignant, hilarious novel is sure to appeal to readers who are still going through it, as well as those who are grateful that they don\u2019t have to go back and grow up all over again.",

    "description": "This Author\u2019s Preferred Edition of Raymond E. Feist\u2019s bestselling coming-of-age saga celebrates the fifteenth anniversary of its publication. Feist introduces a new generation of readers to his riveting novel of adventure and intrigue, revised and updated as he always meant it to be written. It is a work that explores strength and weakness, hope and fear, and what it means to be a man\u2014in a kingdom where peace is the most precious commodity of all.<br /><br />If there were two more impetuous and carefree men in the Kingdom of the Isles, they had yet to be found. Twins Borric and Erland wore that mantle proudly, much to the chagrin of their father, Prince Arutha of Krondor. But their blissful youth has come to an end. Their uncle, the King, has produced no male children. Bypassing himself, Arutha names Borric, the eldest twin by seconds, the Royal Heir. As his brother, Erland will have his own great responsibilities to shoulder. To drive home their future roles, Arutha sends them as ambassadors to Kesh, the most feared nation in the world. Borric and Erland will be presented to the Queen of Kesh\u2014the single most powerful ruler in the known world\u2014at her Seventy-fifth Jubilee Anniversary. <br /><br />But they have not even left Krondor when an assassination attempt on Borric is thwarted. Aware that he is being provoked into war, Arutha does not rise to the bait. His sons\u2019 journey will not be deterred, for nothing less than peace is riding on it. Yet there is to be no peace for the young princes. When their traveling party is ambushed, Borric disappears and is presumed dead\u2014sending Erland into spirals of rage and grief as he is forced to navigate alone the court intrigues at Kesh. But unbeknownst to anyone, Borric lives and has escaped his captors. In a strange land, with a price on his head, Borric must use all his wits and stamina to find his way back to his brother. <br /><br />On separate paths, the two men\u2014one a fugitive and one a future king\u2014make their journey toward maturity, honor, and duty. For every step they take could sway the fragile peace of the land, as those who crave war rally against them\u2014and become ever more daring.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

Even those closest to him are suspect and as Roo struggles to build his financial empire, betrayal is always close at hand. His instinctive cunning will serve him well, but he will soon realise that the road to success is far from smooth.<br /><br />And while Roo works towards achieving his goal, the memory of the distant forces of darkness are never far away. For the war with the Emerald Queen is far from over and the inevitable confrontation will pose the biggest threat yet to his new found wealth and power.",

    "description": "The church was established to serve the world with Christ-like love, not to rule the world. It is called to look like a corporate Jesus, dying on the cross for those who crucified him, not a religious version of Caesar. It is called to manifest the kingdom of the cross in contrast to the kingdom of the sword. Whenever the church has succeeded in gaining what most American evangelicals are now trying to get \u2013 political power \u2013 it has been disastrous both for the church and the culture. Whenever the church picks up the sword, it lays down the cross. The present activity of the religious right is destroying the heart and soul of the evangelical church and destroying its unique witness to the world. The church is to have a political voice, but we are to have it the way Jesus had it: by manifesting an alternative to the political, \u201cpower over,\u201d way of doing life. We are to transform the world by being willing to suffer for others \u2013 exercising \u201cpower under,\u201d not by getting our way in society \u2013 exercising \u201cpower over.\u201d",

    "description": "Once the legendary knights of the Gabala defended the nine duchies. Their hearts were beautiful; their armor was beyond compare. They were greater than princes, more than men.<br />But they were gone, disappeared through a demon-haunted gateway between worlds. Only one held back -- Manannan, whose every instinct told him to stay. Now he was the coward knight, and in torment.<br />Murder and black magic beset the land. Rumors circulated that the king was enchanted, changed, that his soul was dead . . . and that a reign of terror was about to begin.<br />Now Manannan realized he would have to face his darkest fears: he had no choice but to ride through that dreaded gate and seek out his vanished companions.<br />And the secret he would learn there would tear his soul apart . . . .<br />\"A sharp, distinctive medieval fantasy. Dramatic, colorful, taut.\" -- Locus",

    "description": "The chaos spirit had chosen the child Alexander to be its human host. But Parmenion, most powerful warrior of ancient Greece, had won a small victory over the darkness that sought to rule through Alexander. The boy's soul had not been destroyed by evil, but instead had merged with it -- and now Parmenion aided Alexander in the battle between light and dark that constantly raged within him.<br />But there was another world, where the creatures of Greece's legends still flourished. There, the chaos spirit already ruled, through a demon king. In this Greece, there was a prophecy that a child of great power, the legendary golden child, would come and restore the fading magic of the land to the creatures of myth. The demon king believed also that devouring the heart of this fabled child would give him immortality. He believed Alexander, with the power of the chaos spirit within him, to be that child. And so he called Alexander into his world . . .<br />Only Parmenion, guided by the seeress Derae, his lost love from another life, could hope to save Alexander from the demon king. But who could save the young prince from the chaos spirit that threatened to conquer his soul?<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",

    "description": "What do Bach's compositions, Rubik's Cube, the way we choose our mates, and the physics of subatomic particles have in common? All are governed by the laws of symmetry, which elegantly unify scientific and artistic principles. Yet the mathematical language of symmetry-known as group theory-did not emerge from the study of symmetry at all, but from an equation that couldn't be solved. <br /><br /> For thousands of years mathematicians solved progressively more difficult algebraic equations, until they encountered the quintic equation, which resisted solution for three centuries. Working independently, two great prodigies ultimately proved that the quintic cannot be solved by a simple formula. These geniuses, a Norwegian named Niels Henrik Abel and a romantic Frenchman named \u00c9variste Galois, both died tragically young. Their incredible labor, however, produced the origins of group theory. <br /><br /> The first extensive, popular account of the mathematics of symmetry and order, <i>The Equation That Couldn't Be Solved</i> is told not through abstract formulas but in a beautifully written and dramatic account of the lives and work of some of the greatest and most intriguing mathematicians in history.",

Here's the long answer as to why: After releasing our 7th volume, we decided to do The Best of Uncle John's Bathroom Reader, and because it uses some previously published material, we don't consider it a \"volume\" (but it is the 8th book). The following year, we published our 8th volume of all-new material, Uncle John's Ultimate Bathroom Reader (the 8th volume and 9th book.) In 1997 we published the 9th volume/10th book, Uncle John's Giant 10th Anniversary Bathroom Reader. We didn't want to make things confusing by printing the words \"9th edition\" on our 10th anniversary book. (Why that would have been confusing, we're not sure any more, but it was then.)

    "description": "A New York Times best-seller!<br /><br />\"Every one of these cartoons is just something that drifted into my head when I was alone with my thoughts. And, for better or worse, I 'jotted' them down. It was only later, when perhaps I received an angry letter from someone, that it struck me: Hey! Someone's been reading my diary!\"<br /><br />Gary Larson, from the preface to The Complete Far Side<br /><br />Revered by its fans as the funniest, most original, most \"What the ... ?\"-inspiring cartoon ever, The Far Side\u00ae debuted in January 1980 and enjoyed an illustrious 14 years on the worlds comics pages until Gary Larson's retirement in 1994. <br /><br />The Complete Far Side celebrates Gary's twisted, irreverent genius in this ultimate Far Side book, a lavish production, which takes its place alongside collector's-edition art books.<br /><br />A masterpiece of comic brilliance, The Complete Far Side contains every Far Side cartoon ever syndicated over 4,000 if you must know presented in (more or less) chronological order by year of publication, with more than 1,100 that<br />have never before appeared in a book. Also included are additional Far Side cartoons Larson created after<br />his retirement: 13 that appeared in the last Far Side book, <br />Last Chapter and Worse, and six cartoons that periodically ran as a special feature in The New York Times Science Times section as The Far Side of Science.<br /><br />Creator Gary Larson offers a rare glimpse into the mind of <i>The Far Side</i>\u00aein quirky and thoughtful introductions to each of the 14 chapters. Complaint letters, fan letters, and queries from puzzled readers appear alongside some of the more provocative or elusive panels. Actor, author,and comedian Steve Martin offers his pithy thoughts in a foreword, and Gary<br />Larson's former editor describes what it was like to be \"the guy who could explain every Far Side cartoon.\"<br /><br /><i>The Complete Far Side</i> \u00a9 2003 by FarWorks, Inc.

    "description": "<em>The number one <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Bias</em> delivers another bombshell\u2014this time aimed at . . .</em><br /><br /><em>100 People Who Are Screwing Up America</em><br /><br />No preaching. No pontificating. Just some uncommon sense about the things that have made this country great\u2014and the culprits who are screwing it up.<br /><br />Bernard Goldberg takes dead aim at the America Bashers (the cultural elites who look down their snobby noses at \"ordinary\" Americans) . . . the Hollywood Blowhards (incredibly ditzy celebrities who think they're smart just because they're famous) . . . the TV Schlockmeisters (including the one whose show has been compared to a churning mass of maggots devouring rotten meat) . . . the Intellectual Thugs (bigwigs at some of our best colleges, whose views run the gamut from left wing to far left wing) . . . and many more.<br /><br />Goldberg names names, counting down the villains in his rogues' gallery from 100 all the way to 1\u2014and, yes, you-know-who is number 37. Some supposedly \"serious\" journalists also made the list, including the journalist-diva who sold out her integrity and hosted one of the dumbest hours in the history of network television news. And there are those famous miscreants who have made America a nastier place than it ought to be\u2014a far more selfish, vulgar, and cynical place.<br /><br />But Goldberg doesn't just round up the usual suspects we have come to know and detest. He also exposes some of the people who operate away from the limelight but still manage to pull a lot of strings and do all sorts of harm to our culture. Most of all, <em>100 People Who Are Screwing Up America</em> is about a country where as long as anything goes, as one of the good guys in the book puts it, sooner or later everything will go.<br /><br />This is serious stuff for sure. But Goldberg will also make you laugh as he harpoons scoundrels like the congresswoman who thinks there aren't enough hurricanes named after black people, and the environmentalist to the stars who yells at total strangers driving SUVs\u2014even though she tools around the country in a gas-guzzling private jet.<br /><br />With <em>Bias</em>, Bernard Goldberg took us behind the scenes and exposed the way Big Journalism distorts the news. Now he has written a book that goes even further. This time he casts his eye on American culture at large\u2014and the result is a book that is sure to become the voice of all those Americans who feel that no one is speaking for them on perhaps the most vital issue of all: the kind of country in which we want to live.",

    "description": "At first, only a few things are known about the celestial object that astronomers dub Rama. It is huge, weighing more than ten trillion tons. And it is hurtling through the solar system at an inconceivable speed. Then a space probe confirms the unthinkable: Rama is no natural object. It is, incredibly, an interstellar spacecraft. Space explorers and planet-bound scientists alike prepare for mankind's first encounter with alien intelligence. It will kindle their wildest dreams... and fan their darkest fears. For no one knows who the Ramans are or why they have come. And now the moment of rendezvous awaits \u2014 just behind a Raman airlock door.",

    "description": "A surprisingly engaging and, at points, even compelling book...Clinton provides enough of a peek behind the curtain to keep the pages turning and presents intriguing new details on her role in shaping the policies of her husband's presidency.<br /><br />Hillary Rodham Clinton is known to hundreds of millions of people around the world. Yet few beyond her close friends and family have ever heard her account of her extraordinary journey. She writes with candor, humor and passion about her upbringing in suburban, middle-class America in the 1950s and her transformation from Goldwater Girl to student activist to controversial First Lady. Living History is her revealing memoir of life through the White House years. It is also her chronicle of living history with Bill Clinton, a thirty-year adventure in love and politics that survives personal betrayal, relentless partisan investigations and constant public scrutiny. <br /><br />Hillary Rodham Clinton came of age during a time of tumultuous social and political change in America. Like many women of her generation, she grew up with choices and opportunities unknown to her mother or grandmother. She charted her own course through unexplored terrain -- responding to the changing times and her own internal compass -- and became an emblem for some and a lightning rod for others. Wife, mother, lawyer, advocate and international icon, she has lived through America's great political wars, from Watergate to Whitewater. <br /><br />The only First Lady to play a major role in shaping domestic legislation, Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled tirelessly around the country to champion health care, expand economic and educational opportunity and promote the needs of children and families, and she crisscrossed the globe on behalf of women's rights, human rights and democracy. She redefined the position of First Lady and helped save the presidency from an unconstitutional, politically motivated impeachment. Intimate, powerful and inspiring, Living History captures the essence of one of the most remarkable women of our time and the challenging process by which she came to define herself and find her own voice -- as a woman and as a formidable figure in American politics.",

The rich detail makes for vintage Irving.\"<br />--The Boston Sunday Globe<br />\"The Cider House Rules is filled with people to love and to feel for. . . . The characters in John Irving's novel break all the rules, and yet they remain noble and free-spirited. Victims of tragedy, violence, and injustice, their lives seem more interesting and full of thought-provoking dilemmas than the lives of many real people.\"<br />--The Houston Post<br />\"John Irving's sixth and best novel . . . He is among the very best storytellers at work today. At the base of Irving's own moral concerns is a rare and lasting regard for human kindness.\"<br />--The Philadelphia Inquirer<br />\"Entertaining and affecting . . . John Irving is the most relentlessly inventive writer around. He proliferates colorful incidents and crotchets of character. . . . A truly astounding amount of artistry and ingenuity.\"<br />--The San Diego Union",

That same season, The Great Salt Lake began to rise to record heights, threatening the herons, owls, and snowy egrets that Williams, a poet and naturalist, had come to gauge her life by. One event was nature at its most random, the other a by-product of rogue technology: Terry's mother, and Terry herself, had been exposed to the fallout of atomic bomb tests in the 1950s. As it interweaves these narratives of dying and accommodation, <b>Refuge</b> transforms tragedy into a document of renewal and spiritual grace, resulting in a work that has become a classic.",

    "description": "The first major Katharine Hepburn biography independent of her control reveals the smart, complicated, and sophisticated woman behind the image<br />Onscreen she played society girls, Spencer Tracy's sidekick, lionesses in winter. But the best character Katharine Hepburn ever created was Katharine Hepburn: a Connecticut Yankee, outspoken and elegant, she wore pants whatever the occasion and bristled at Hollywood glitter. So captivating was her image that she never seemed less than authentic. But how well did we know her, really? Was there a woman behind the image who was more human, more driven, and ultimately more triumphant because of her vulnerability? <br />William J. Mann--a cultural historian and journalist, a sympathetic admirer but no mere fan--has fashioned an intimate, often revisionist, and truly unique close-up that challenges much of what we think we know about the Great Kate. Previous biographies--mostly products of friends and fans--have recycled the stories she hid behind, taking Hollywood myths at face value. Mann goes deeper, delivering new details from friends and family who have not been previously interviewed and drawing on materials only available since Hepburn's death. <br />With affection, intelligence, and a voluminous knowledge of Hollywood history, Mann shows us how a woman originally considered too special and controversial for fame learned the fine arts of movie stardom and transformed herself into an icon as durable and all-American as the Statue of Liberty.",

Whether writing about the love (and conflict) between parents and children or between husband and wife, or about the struggles of aging single mothers or disheartened political organizers to make sense of the world, she brings the same unerring ear for the rhythm of life as it is actually lived.<br /><br /><i>The Collected Stories</i> is a 1994 National Book Award Finalist for Fiction.",

    "description": "Crossing the boundaries of philosophy, theology, psychology, and literature, the Danish writer Soren Kierkegaard is regarded as one of the most significant and influential figures in contemporary thought. In Kierkegaard's view, faith is the most essential task of life. Faith is not a matter of dogmatic adherence, but rather of subjective passion. In \"Purity of Heart\", Kierkegaard discusses different aspects of living, particularly the responsibility of single-minded spiritual seeking and ethical integrity, offering clues to the nature of the good while insisting that each reader must work this out for themselves.",

    "description": "An instant classic for a new generation of monkey-wrenching food activists. Food in America is cheap and abundant, yet the vast majority of it is diminished in terms of flavor and nutrition, anonymous and mysterious after being shipped thousands of miles and passing through inscrutable supply chains, and controlled by multinational corporations. In our system of globalized food commodities, convenience replaces quality and a connection to the source of our food. Most of us know almost nothing about how our food is grown or produced, where it comes from, and what health value it really has. It is food as pure corporate commodity. We all deserve much better than that. <br /><br /> In <em>The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved</em>, author Sandor Ellix Katz (<em>Wild Fermentation</em>, Chelsea Green 2003) profiles grassroots activists who are taking on Big Food, creating meaningful alternatives, and challenging the way many Americans think about food. From community-supported local farmers, community gardeners, and seed saving activists, to underground distribution networks of contraband foods and food resources rescued from the waste stream, this book shows how ordinary people can resist the dominant system, revive community-based food production, and take direct responsibility for their own health and nutrition.",

    "description": "<strong>The nation's premier communications expert shares his wisdom on how the words we choose can change the course of business, of politics, and of life in this country</strong> In <em>Words That Work</em>, Luntz offers a behind-the-scenes look at how the tactical use of words and phrases affects what we buy, who we vote for, and even what we believe in. With chapters like \"The Ten Rules of Successful Communication\" and \"The 21 Words and Phrases for the 21st Century,\" he examines how choosing the right words is essential. Nobody is in a better position to explain than Frank Luntz: He has used his knowledge of words to help more than two dozen Fortune 500 companies grow. Hell tell us why Rupert Murdoch's six-billion-dollar decision to buy DirectTV was smart because satellite was more cutting edge than \"digital cable,\" and why pharmaceutical companies transitioned their message from \"treatment\" to \"prevention\" and \"wellness.\" If you ever wanted to learn how to talk your way out of a traffic ticket or talk your way into a raise, this book's for you.",

    "description": "Convergence Culture maps a new territory: where old and new media intersect, where grassroots and corporate media collide, where the power of the media producer and the power of the consumer interact in unpredictable ways.<br /><br />Henry Jenkins, one of America's most respected media analysts, delves beneath the new media hype to uncover the important cultural transformations that are taking place as media converge. He takes us into the secret world of \"Survivor\" Spoilers, where avid internet users pool their knowledge to unearth the show's secrets before they are revealed on the air. He introduces us to young \"Harry Potter\" fans who are writing their own Hogwarts tales while executives at Warner Brothers struggle for control of their franchise. He shows us how \"The Matrix\" has pushed transmedia storytelling to new levels, creating a fictional world where consumers track down bits of the story across multiple media channels.Jenkins argues that struggles over convergence will redefine the face of American popular culture. Industry leaders see opportunities to direct content across many channels to increase revenue and broaden markets. At the same time, consumers envision a liberated public sphere, free of network controls, in a decentralized media environment. Sometimes corporate and grassroots efforts reinforce each other, creating closer, more rewarding relations between media producers and consumers. Sometimes these two forces are at war.<br /><br />Jenkins provides a riveting introduction to the world where every story gets told and every brand gets sold across multiple media platforms. He explains the cultural shift that is occurring as consumers fight for control across disparate channels, changing the way we do business, elect our leaders, and educate our children.",

    "description": "Annie Proulx has written some of the most original and brilliant short stories in contemporary literature, and for many readers and reviewers, \"Brokeback Mountain\" is her masterpiece. <p> Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist, two ranch hands, come together when they're working as sheepherder and camp tender one summer on a range above the tree line. At first, sharing an isolated tent, the attraction is casual, inevitable, but something deeper catches them that summer. </p><p> Both men work hard, marry, and have kids because that's what cowboys do. But over the course of many years and frequent separations this relationship becomes the most important thing in their lives, and they do anything they can to preserve it. </p><p> <i>The New Yorker</i> won the National Magazine Award for Fiction for its publication of \"Brokeback Mountain,\" and the story was included in <i>Prize Stories 1998: The O. Henry Awards.</i> In gorgeous and haunting prose, Proulx limns the difficult, dangerous affair between two cowboys that survives everything but the world's violent intolerance.</p>",

    "description": "<b>Oprah Book Club\u00ae Selection, February 1999:</b> Originally published in Switzerland, and gracefully translated into English by Carol Brown Janeway, <i>The Reader</i> is a brief tale about sex, love, reading, and shame in postwar Germany. Michael Berg is 15 when he begins a long, obsessive affair with Hanna, an enigmatic older woman. He never learns very much about her, and when she disappears one day, he expects never to see her again. But, to his horror, he does. Hanna is a defendant in a trial related to Germany's Nazi past, and it soon becomes clear that she is guilty of an unspeakable crime. As Michael follows the trial, he struggles with an overwhelming question: What should his generation do with its knowledge of the Holocaust? \"We should not believe we can comprehend the incomprehensible, we may not compare the incomparable.... Should we only fall silent in revulsion, shame, and guilt? To what purpose?\"<p> <i>The Reader</i>, which won the <i>Boston Book Review</i>'s Fisk Fiction Prize, wrestles with many more demons in its few, remarkably lucid pages. What does it mean to love those people--parents, grandparents, even lovers--who committed the worst atrocities the world has ever known? And is any atonement possible through literature? Schlink's prose is clean and pared down, stripped of unnecessary imagery, dialogue, and excess in any form. What remains is an austerely beautiful narrative of the attempt to breach the gap between Germany's pre- and postwar generations, between the guilty and the innocent, and between words and silence. <i>--R. Ellis</i></p>",

And she's about to become your new best friend. </p><p> Annemarie Wilcox, or Shug as her family calls her, is beginning to think there's nothing worse than being twelve. She's too tall, too freckled, and way too flat-chested. Shug is sure that there's not one good or amazing thing about her. And now she has to start junior high, where the friends she counts most dear aren't acting so dear anymore -- especially Mark, the boy she's known her whole life through. Life is growing up all around her, and all Shug wants is for things to be like they used to be. How is a person supposed to prepare for what happens tomorrow when there's just no figuring out today?</p>",

    "description": "Most Christians view the book of Ecclesiastes as an enigma, a puzzle from which we might draw a few aphorisms but little else. Douglas Wilson's fresh, lucid treatment of this wonderful book, enables us to see that its message is not a confused riddle but an incisive indictment of \"the wisdom of this world.\" We learn that what we can \"modernity\" is simply a term for men sinning in old ways with new toys and tools. There is truly nothing new \"under the sun;\" man's problems today are exactly what they have been since the Fall. And the answer to man's problem is just as old, yet forever new - \"the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\"",

    "description": "In his explosive New York Times bestseller, top CIA operative Robert Baer paints a chilling picture of how terrorism works on the inside and provides startling evidence of how Washington politics sabotaged the CIA\u2019s efforts to root out the world\u2019s deadliest terrorists, allowing for the rise of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda and the continued entrenchment of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.<br /><br />A veteran case officer in the CIA\u2019s Directorate of Operations in the Middle East, Baer witnessed the rise of terrorism first hand and the CIA\u2019s inadequate response to it, leading to the attacks of September 11, 2001. This riveting book is both an indictment of an agency that lost its way and an unprecedented look at the roots of modern terrorism, and includes a new afterword in which Baer speaks out about the American war on terrorism and its profound implications throughout the Middle East.<br /><br />\u201cRobert Baer was considered perhaps the best on-the-ground field <br />officer in the Middle East.\u201d<br />\u2013Seymour M. Hersh, The New Yorker<br /><br /><b>From The Preface</b><br />This book is a memoir of one foot soldier\u2019s career in the other cold war, the one against terrorist networks. It\u2019s a story about places most Americans will never travel to, about people many Americans would prefer to think we don\u2019t need to do business with.<br /><br />This memoir, I hope, will show the reader how spying is supposed to work, where the CIA lost its way, and how we can bring it back again. But I hope this book will accomplish one more purpose as well: I hope it will show why I am angry about what happened to the CIA. And I want to show why every American and everyone who cares about the preservation of this country should be angry and alarmed, too.<br /><br />The CIA was systematically destroyed by political correctness, by petty Beltway wars, by careerism, and much more. At a time when terrorist threats were compounding globally, the agency that should have been monitoring them was being scrubbed clean instead. Americans were making too much money to bother. Life was good. The White House and the National Security Council became cathedrals of commerce where the interests of big business outweighed the interests of protecting American citizens at home and abroad. Defanged and dispirited, the CIA went along for the ride. And then on September 11, 2001, the reckoning for such vast carelessness was presented for all the world to see.<br />",

Since his untimely death in 1982, interest in Dick's works has continued to mount and his reputation has been further enhanced by a growing body of critical attention. The Philip K. Dick Award is now given annually to a distinguished work of science fiction, and the Philip K. Dick Society is devoted to the study and promulgation of his works.This collection includes all of the writer's earliest short and medium-length fiction (including some previously unpublished stories) covering the years 1952-1955. These fascinating stories include We Can Remember It for You Wholesale, The Cookie Lady, The World She Wanted, and many others.<br /><br />\"A useful acquisition for any serious SF library or collection.\" -- Kirkus Reviews<br /><br />\"The collected stories of Philip K. Dick is awe inspiring.\" -- The Washington Post<br /><br />\"More than anyone else in the field, Mr. Dick really puts you inside people's minds.\" -- Wall Street Journal",

    "description": "<b><i>New York Times </i>Bestseller</b><br /><br /><b>The good, the bad, and the ugly, served up Bourdain-style.</b><br /><br />Bestselling chef and <i>Parts Unknown </i>host Anthony Bourdain has never been one to pull punches. In <i>The Nasty Bits</i>, he serves up a well-seasoned hellbroth of candid, often outrageous stories from his worldwide misadventures. Whether scrounging for eel in the backstreets of Hanoi, revealing what you didn't want to know about the more unglamorous aspects of making television, calling for the head of raw food activist Woody Harrelson, or confessing to lobster-killing guilt, Bourdain is as entertaining as ever.<br /><br />Bringing together the best of his previously uncollected nonfiction--and including new, never-before-published material--<i>The Nasty Bits</i> is a rude, funny, brutal and passionate stew for fans and the uninitiated alike.",

    "description": "A stunningly innovative visual edition of this award-winning book--designed to appeal to spiritual seekers and visually oriented readers.Philip Yancey's What's So Amazing About Grace? won the Book of the Year Award in 1998 and has sold over one million copies since it was first published in 1997. Now this innovative visual edition uses the life-transforming content of Yancey's message and makes it accessible to a whole new audience. This visually rich book takes portions of the text of the original book and illustrates the themes and messages with provocative full-color photography and graphic illustrations.The creators of this visual edition designed it with the needs of contemporary postmodern readers in mind: both spiritual seekers and the younger, more visually oriented readers of today's culture. By combining Yancey's engaging style with striking images that enhance and illuminate the message, this unique book enables readers to \"experience grace\" as they interact with the powerfully imaginative format.With deep personal honesty Yancey paints true portraits of grace's life-changing power as he searches for its presence in his own life and the life of the church. He explores grace--God's love for the undeserving--while challenging Christians to become living answers to a world that desperately wants to know: What's so amazing about grace?",

She struck a chord with bluesy jazz ballads like \"Put a Little Sugar in My Bowl\" and powerful protest songs such as \"Mississippi Goddam\" and \"To Be Young, Gifted, and Black,\" the anthem of the American Civil Rights movement.<br /><br />Here are the many lives and loves of Nina Simone, recounted in her unshakable voice.",

    "description": "This practical guide to hearing God's voice shows how an ordinary man who committed to hearing God and obeying Him, became the founder of the largest interdenominational missions organization in the world.<br /><br />Loren Cunningham's dream began with a vision -- waves of young people moving out across the continents announcing the Good News of Jesus Christ to the whole earth. Decades later, Loren's vision has grown into an interdenominational movement of Christians from around the world who are dedicated to presenting the Gospel to this generation.<br /><br />How did God move Loren's dream from vision to reality? He led Loren and his wife, Darlene, through a series of tough lessons in guidance. The exciting story of Youth With A Mission has much to teach us about the art of listening to God as we seek to be used by Him. Is That Really You, God? is not only a practical guide to hearing God's voice but also an amazing testimony to how following His direction can impact our lives and our world for the glory of God's kingdom.",

    "description": "Twenty-five years after her classic <i>On Photography</i>, Susan Sontag returns to the subject of visual representations of war and violence in our culture today. How does the spectacle of the sufferings of others (via television or newsprint) affect us? Are viewers inured--or incited--to violence by the depiction of cruelty? <br /><br />In <i>Regarding the Pain of Others</i>, Sontag takes a fresh look at the representation of atrocity--from Goya's The Disasters of War to photographs of the American Civil War, lynchings of blacks in the South, and the Nazi death camps, to contemporary horrific images of Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Israel and Palestine, and New York City on September 11, 2001. In <i>Regarding the Pain of Others</i> Susan Sontag once again changes the way we think about the uses and meanings of images in our world, and offers an important reflection about how war itself is waged (and understood) in our time.<br /><br />Features an analysis of our numbed response to images of horror. This title alters our thinking about the uses and meanings of images, and about the nature of war, the limits of sympathy, and the obligations of conscience.",

Like all his work, it is valuable for far more than just its historical implications. In seven wonderfully integrated parts, different aspects of human existence are magnified and reduced, reordered and emphasized, newly examined, analyzed and experienced.",

    "description": "It is a tale of revolution, of the rebellion of a former penal colony on the Moon against its masters on the Earth. It is a tale of a culture whose family structures are based on the presence of two men for every woman, leading to novel forms of marriage and family. It is the story of the disparate people, a computer technician, a vigorous young female agitator, and an elderly academic who become the movement's leaders, and of Mike, the supercomputer whose sentience is known only to the revolt's inner circle, who for reasons of his own is committed to the revolution's ultimate success.",

    "description": "<b>The stunning, classic coming-of-age novel written by one of America's foremost Southern writers</b><br /><br />A legendary author on par with William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor, Thomas Wolfe published <i>Look Homeward, Angel</i>, his first novel, about a young man's burning desire to leave his small town and tumultuous family in search of a better life, in 1929. It gave the world proof of his genius and launched a powerful legacy.<br /><br />The novel follows the trajectory of Eugene Gant, a brilliant and restless young man whose wanderlust and passion shape his adolescent years in rural North Carolina. Wolfe said that <i>Look Homeward, Angel</i> is \"a book made out of my life,\" and his largely autobiographical story about the quest for a greater intellectual life has resonated with and influenced generations of readers, including some of today's most important novelists. Rich with lyrical prose and vivid characterizations, this twentieth-century American classic will capture the hearts and imaginations of every reader.",

    "description": "From the roots of an ancient witchcraft ... a new terror to destroy.<br /><br />With billions of dollars at stake, every scientist in America is fighting to discover the next Prozac, the latest 'feel good' drug.<br /><br />Edward Armstrong believes he has hit the jackpot. He has isolated a stunningly effective anti-depressant from a bacterial mould first uncovered over two hundred years ago.<br /><br />But there is more to the drug than anyone could have imagined. When Edward turns violent and the corpses of mutilated animals appear near the laboratory, his girlfriend decides to investigate the truth about this new 'miracle' drug. Before it claims any more innocent lives...<br /><br />From the best-selling doctor whose high-voltage thrillers regularly quicken readers' pulses comes a harrowing tale of greed, abandoned ethics, and ambition run awry in the newest area of medical intervention: cosmetic psychopharmacology.<br /><br />Prozac-like drugs are being prescribed not only for their original purposes but increasingly to alter individual personalities to currently valued norms. With dead-on accuracy and the pre-science of tomorrow's headlines, Robin Cook explores the perilous intersection where fame and unfathomable lucre waylay and seduce the very best and brightest of those sworn to do no harm.<br /><br />When neuroscientist Edward Armstrong begins dating Kimberly Stewart, a descendant of a woman who was hanged as a witch at the time of the Salem witch trials, he takes advantage of the opportunity to delve into a pet theory: that the \"devil\" in Salem in 1692 had been a hallucinogenic drug inadvertently consumed with mould-tainted grain. In an attempt to prove his theory, Edward grows the mould he believes responsible from samples taken from the Stewart estate. In a brilliant designer-drug transformation, the poison becomes Ultra, the next generation of antidepressants with truly startling therapeutic capabilities.",

    "description": "Widely recognized as the finest definition of existentialist philosophy ever written, this book introduced existentialism to America in 1958. Barrett speaks eloquently and directly to concerns of the 1990s: a period when the irrational and the absurd are no better integrated than before and when humankind is in even greater danger of destroying its existence without ever understanding the meaning of its existence.<br /><br /><i>Irrational Man</i> begins by discussing the roots of existentialism in the art and thinking of Augustine, Aquinas, Pascal, Baudelaire, Blake, Dostoevski, Tolstoy, Hemingway, Picasso, Joyce, and Beckett. The heart of the book explains the views of the foremost existentialists--Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Sartre. The result is a marvelously lucid definition of existentialism and a brilliant interpretation of its impact.",

    "description": "DNA is the genetic material that defines us as individuals. Over the last two decades, it has emerged as a powerful tool for solving crimes and determining guilt and innocence. But, very recently, an important new aspect of DNA has been revealed\u2014it contains a detailed record of evolution. That is, DNA is a living chronicle of how the marvelous creatures that inhabit our planet have adapted to its many environments, from the freezing waters of the Antarctic to the lush canopy of the rain forest.<br /><br /><br />In the pages of this highly readable narrative, Sean Carroll guides the general reader on a tour of the massive DNA record of three billion years of evolution to see how the fittest are made. And what a eye-opening tour it is\u2014one featuring immortal genes, fossil genes, and genes that bear the scars of past battles with horrible diseases. This book clinches the case for evolution, beyond any reasonable doubt.",

His arrival changes everything, and sets in motion a rapid-fire plot with all the twists and turns we expect of Coupland. By turns funny and heartbreaking, <i>Eleanor Rigby</i> is a fast-paced read and a haunting exploration of the ways in which loneliness affects us all.<br /><br />",

    "description": "<i>Integral Spirituality: A Startling New Role for Religion in the Modern and Postmodern World</i> is being widely called the most important book on spirituality in our time.<br /><p><br />Applying his highly acclaimed integral approach, Ken Wilber formulates a theory of spirituality that honors the truths of modernity and postmodernity\u2014including the revolutions in science and culture\u2014while incorporating the essential insights of the great religions. He shows how spirituality today combines the enlightenment of the East, which excels at cultivating higher states of consciousness, with the enlightenment of the West, which offers developmental and psychodynamic psychology. Each contributes key components to a more integral spirituality.<br /></p><p><br />On the basis of this integral framework, a radically new role for the world\u2019s religions is proposed. Because these religions have such a tremendous influence on the worldview of the majority of the earth\u2019s population, they are in a privileged position to address some of the biggest conflicts we face. By adopting a more integral view, the great religions can act as facilitators of human development: from magic to mythic to rational to pluralistic to integral\u2014and to a global society that honors and includes all the stations of life along the way.</p>",

    "description": "\"I have tried to describe a Christianity which is fully compatible with everything we now know, and to indicate why Christians feel privileged to give their lives to it.\"<br />\u2014Huston Smith<br /><br />In his most personal and passionate book on the spiritual life, renowned author, scholar, and teacher of world religions Huston Smith turns to his own life-long religion, Christianity. With stories and personal anecdotes, Smith not only presents the basic beliefs and essential teachings of Christianity, but argues why religious belief matters in today's secular world.<br /><br />Though there is a wide variety of contemporary interpretations of Christianity\u2014some of them conflicting\u2014Smith cuts through these to describe Christianity's \"Great Tradition,\" the common faith of the first millennium of believers, which is the trunk of the tree from which Christianity's many branches, twigs, and leaves have grown. This is not the exclusivist Christianity of strict fundamentalists, nor the liberal, watered-down Christianity practiced by many contemporary churchgoers. In exposing biblical literalism as unworkable as well as enumerating the mistakes of modern secularists, Smith presents the very soul of a real and substantive faith, one still relevant and worth believing in.<br /><br />Smith rails against the hijacked Christianity of politicians who exploit it for their own needs. He decries the exercise of business that widens the gap between rich and poor, and fears education has lost its sense of direction. For Smith, the media has become a business that sensationalizes news rather than broadening our understanding, and art and music have become commercial and shocking rather than enlightening. Smith reserves his harshest condemnation, however, for secular modernity, which has stemmed from the misreading of science\u2014the mistake of assuming that \"absence of evidence\" of a scientific nature is \"evidence of absence.\" These mistakes have all but banished faith in transcendence and the Divine from mainstream culture and pushed it to the margins.<br /><br />Though the situation is grave, these modern misapprehensions can be corrected, says Smith, by reexamining the great tradition of Christianity's first millennium and reaping the lessons it holds for us today. This fresh examination of the Christian worldview, its history, and its major branches provides the deepest, most authentic vision of Christianity\u2014one that is both tolerant and substantial, traditional and relevant.",

Assembled here is a collection of Mahfouz's artful meditations on the vicissitudes of post-Revolution Egypt. Diverse in style and narrative technique, together they render a rich, nuanced, and universally resonant vision of modern life in the Middle East.<br /><br /><b>The Beggar</b> is a complex tale of alienation and despair. In the aftermath of Nasser's revolution, a man sacrifices his work and family to a series of illicit love affairs. Released from jail in post-Revolutionary times, the hero of<b>The Thief and the Dogs</b> blames an unjust society for his ill fortune, eventually bringing himself to destruction. <b>Autumn Quail</b> is a tale of moral responsibility, isolation, and political downfall about a corrupt bureaucrat who is one of the early victims of the purge after the 1952 revolution in Egypt.",

They set out on an adventure that proves longer and more dangerous than they could have imagined.

With the same sensitivity and artfulness that are the trademarks of her award-winning novels, Shields explores the life of a writer whose own novels have engaged and delighted readers for the past two hundred years. Jane Austen reveals both the very private woman and the acclaimed author behind the enduring classics Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, and Emma. With her forceful insight and gentle wit, she was the ultimate chronicler of the mores and manners of her time as well as a groundbreaking author who would influence many of our greatest contemporary novelists.Who was this woman that created both characters that leap off the page and entertaining plots, yet managed to quietly challenge a strict social order? What gave her the motivation to continue writing when women were excluded from the publishing world? In this compelling and passionate biography, Carol Shields explores the life of this amazing woman: from her early family life in Stevenson, to her later years at Bath, her broken engagement, and her tumultuous relationship with her sister Cassandra.",

    "description": "<i>Dear Sam, <br /><br />As your only living grandfather, I want to welcome you into this world. Always remember that ... life is a gift and a blessing.</i><p></p><br /><br /><b>In the tradition of such bestsellers as <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i> and <i>Riding the Bus with My Sister,</i> this emotionally powerful collection of letters from grandfather to grandson will touch readers right down to their core. Award-winning radio host, newspaper columnist, and psychologist Daniel Gottlieb has created a truly inspirational work.</b> <p></p><br /><br />When his grandson was born, Daniel Gottlieb began to write a series of heartfelt letters that he hoped Sam would read later in life. He planned to cover all the important topics -- dealing with your parents, handling bullies, falling in love, coping with death -- and what motivated him was the fear that he might not live long enough to see Sam reach adulthood. You see, Daniel Gottlieb is a quadriplegic -- the result of a near-fatal automobile accident that occurred two decades ago -- and he knows enough not to take anything for granted.<p></p> <br />Then, when Sam was only fourteen months old, he was diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disability, a form of autism, and suddenly everything changed. Now the grandfather and grandson were bound by something more: a disability -- and Daniel Gottlieb's special understanding of what that means became invaluable.<p></p> <br />A lovingly written, emotionally gripping book that offers unique -- and universal -- insights into what it means to be human.<p></p> <br />In addition to his thriving psychotherapy practice, <b>Daniel Gottlieb</b> serves as the host of Voices in the Family, an award-winning mental health call-in show on Philadelphia's much-respected public radio station, WHYY. He also writes a bimonthly column for the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> entitled \"On Healing,\" and is the author of two books. He lectures locally and nationally on a variety of topics affecting the well-being of people, families, and the larger community.",

    "description": "\"I have spent most of my life in New Jersey, but the blood of a geisha courses through me yet.\"<br /><br />If Kiki Takehashi's life is dramatically different from that of her reserved Japanese-American mother, it is light-years away from that of her grandmother, whom she knows only through old family stories. Kiki has recently become engaged to Eric, a handsome, successful New York City lawyer. But at the same time she is haunted--quite literally--by the memory of her friend Phillip, killed the previous year in a mountaineering accident.<br /><br />Kiki has never met her grandmother Yukiko, for whom she is named. Still, thoroughly American though she is, she feels a secret kinship with her. Kiki is swept up by the story of this strong, proud, passionate woman who, against all odds, in a time and place far different from her own, was sold by her impoverished family, became a famous geisha, and found the love that has so far eluded the rest of the Takehashi women.<br /><br />Lyrical, haunting, and stunningly evocative, <b>One Hundred and One Ways</b> introduces a powerful and exciting new voice in contemporary fiction.",

    "description": "From Mordecai Richler, one of our greatest satirists, comes one of literature's most delightful characters, Duddy Kravitz -- in a novel that belongs in the pantheon of seminal twentieth century books. <br /> Duddy -- the third generation of a Jewish immigrant family in Montreal -- is combative, amoral, scheming, a liar, and totally hilarious. From his street days tormenting teachers at the Jewish academy to his time hustling four jobs at once in a grand plan to \"be somebody,\" Duddy learns about living -- and the lesson is an outrageous roller-coaster ride through the human comedy. As Richler turns his blistering commentary on love, money, and politics, <i>The Apprenticeship Of Duddy Kravitz</i> becomes a lesson for us all...in laughter and in life.",

    "description": "because i was bad in my last life.because allah has willed it.because the rich do nothing for the poor.because the poor do nothing for themselves.because it is my destiny.<br /><br />These are just some of the answers to the simple yet groundbreaking question William T. Vollmann asks in cities and villages around the globe: \"Why are you poor?\" In the tradition of James Agee's Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, Vollmann's Poor People struggles to confront poverty in all its hopelessness and brutality, its pride and abject fear, its fierce misery and its quiet resignation. Poor People allows the poor to speak for themselves, explaining the causes and consequences of their impoverishment in their own cultural, social, and religious terms.<br /><br />There is the alcoholic mother in Buddhist Thailand, sure that her poverty is punishment for transgressions in a former life, and her ten-year-old daughter, whose faith in her own innocence gives her hope that her sin in the last life was simply being rich. There is the Siberian-born beggar who pins her woes on a tick bite and a Gypsy curse more than a half century ago, and the homeless, widowed Afghan women who have been relegated to a \"respected\" but damning invisibility. There are Big and Little Mountain, two Japanese salarymen who lost their jobs suddenly and now live in a blue-tarp hut under a Kyoto bridge. And, most haunting of all, there is the faded, starving beggar-girl, staring empty-eyed on the back steps of Bangkok's Central Railroad Station, whose only response to Vollmann's query is simply, \"I think I am rich.\"<br /><br />The result of Vollmann's fearless journey is a look at poverty unlike any other. Complete with more than 100 powerfully affecting photographs--taken of the interviewees by the author himself--this series of vignettes and searing insights represents a tremendous step toward an understanding of this age-old social ill. With intense compassion and a scrupulously unpatronizing eye, Vollmann invites his readers to recognize in our fellow human beings their full dignity, fallibility, pride, and pain, and the power of their hard-fought resilience.",

    "description": "In the past, Ulysses has been labeled dirty, blasphemous, and even unreadable. None of these adjectives, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains the modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in a close-focus sort of way) suspenseful. And despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, Ulysses is also a compulsively readable book.<br /><br />William Blake saw the universe in a grain of sand. Joyce saw it in Dublin, Ireland, on June 16, 1904, a day distinguished by its utter normality. Two characters, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, go about their separate business, crossing paths with a gallery of indelible Dubliners. We watch them teach, eat, stroll the streets, argue, and (in Bloom's case) masturbate. And thanks to the book's stream-of-consciousness technique--which suggests no mere stream but an impossibly deep, swift-running river--we're privy to their thoughts, emotions, and memories. The result? Almost every variety of human experience is crammed into the accordian folds of a single day, which makes Ulysses not just an experimental work but the very last word in realism.<br /><br />Considered the greatest 20th century novel written in English, in this edition Walter Gabler uncovers previously unseen text.",

    "description": "E.D.E.N. Southworth was one of the most popular and prolific writers of the nineteenth century and her Capitola Black, or Black Cap - a cross-dressing, adventure-seeking girl-woman - was so well-loved that the book was serialized three times between 1859 and 1888 and was dramatized in forty different versions. When we first meet sharp and witty Capitola she is living among beggars and street urchins, and dressed as a boy because a boy can get work and be safe, whereas a girl is left to starve for want of \"proper\" employment. Unknown to her, Capitola has a very rich elderly guardian who finds her at a providential moment and takes her back to his palatial mansion where she finds herself \"decomposing above ground for want of having my blood stirred.\" But not to fear. There are bandits, true-loves, evil men, long-lost mothers, and sweet women friends in Capitola's future - not to mention thunder storms, kidnap attempts, and duels. The pace is fast, the action wonderfully unbelievable. This is escape literature at its nineteenth-century best, with a woman at its center who makes you feel strong, daring, and reckless.<br /><br />",

    "description": "<i>The Only Three Questions That Count</i> is the first book to show you how to think about investing for yourself and develop innovative ways to understand and profit from the markets. The only way to consistently beat the markets is by knowing something others don't know. This book will show you how to do just that by using three simple questions. You'll see why CNBC's Mad Money host and money manager James J. Cramer says, \"I believe that reading his book may be the single best thing you could do this year to make yourself a better investor. In <i>The Only Three Questions That Count</i>, Ken Fisher challenges the conventional wisdoms of investing, overturns glib theories with hard facts, and blows up complacent beliefs about money and the markets. Ultimately, he says, the key to successful investing is daring to challenge yourself and whatever you believe to be true. Packed with more than 100 visuals, usable tools, and a glossary, <i>The Only Three Questions That Count</i> is an entertaining and educational experience in the markets unlike any other, giving you an opportunity to reap the huge rewards that only the markets can offer.",

    "description": "David Chadwick, a Texas-raised wanderer, college dropout, bumbling social activist, and hobbyhorse musician, began his study under Shunryu Suzuki Roshi in 1966. In 1988 Chadwick flew to Japan to begin a four-year period of voluntary exile and remedial Zen education. In <i>Thank You and OK!</i> he recounts his experiences both inside and beyond the monastery walls and offers insightful portraits of the characters he knew in that world: the bickering monks, the patient abbot, the trotting housewives, the ominous insects, the bewildered bureaucrats, and the frustrating English-language students, as they worked inexorably toward initiating him into the mysterious ways of Japan. Whether you're interested in Japan, Buddhism, or exotic travel writing, this book is great fun.",

    "description": "With a foreword by William Burroughs, this frenetic autobiography relates the life story of Timothy Leary, one of the key figures of the1960s North American counterculture, and the primary proponent of psychedelia as a way of life. Leary\u2019s controversial views made him a public enemy in the United States, where he was eventually arrested in 1970 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. His escape from prison, and subsequent flight, with the help of the Weathermen, first to Algeria, then to Switzerland, Vienna, Beirut, and finally Kabul, Afghanistan, read like something out of a novel. Other events in Leary\u2019s life were no less dramatic, and he chronicles them in this book openly and energetically. Intriguing cameos of iconic figures are woven into the author\u2019s life history, including one by Cary Grant, whose experiments with lysergic acid are described in detail. Ultimately, Timothy Leary\u2019s memories are as much a record of a singular era in American history as they are one man\u2019s recollections of a struggle against persecution and being ostracized.",

    "description": "To a generation in full revolt against any form of authority, \"Tune in, turn on, drop out\" became a mantra, and its popularizer, Dr. Timothy Leary, a guru. A charismatic and brilliant psychologist, Leary became first intrigued and then obsessed by the effects of psychedelic drugs in the 1960s while teaching at Harvard, where he not only encouraged but instituted their experimental use among students and faculty. What began as research into human consciousness turned into a mission to alter consciousness itself. Leary transformed himself from serious social scientist into counterculture shaman, embodying the idealism and the hedonism of an age of revolutionary change.<br /><br />Timothy Leary is the first major biography of one of the most controversial figures in postwar America.<br />",

Some of the most potent beliefs among brilliant minds are based on supposition alone -- yet that is enough to push those minds toward making the theory viable.<br /><br />Eminent cultural impresario, editor, and publisher of <i>Edge</i> (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edge.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.edge.org</a>), John Brockman asked a group of leading scientists and thinkers to answer the question: What do you believe to be true even though you cannot prove it? This book brings together the very best answers from the most distinguished contributors. <br /><br />Thought-provoking and hugely compelling, this collection of bite-size thought-experiments is a fascinating insight into the instinctive beliefs of some of the most brilliant minds today.",

Florentino est\u00e1 anonadado, pero es un rom\u00e1ntico. Su carrera en los negocios florece, y aunque sostiene 622 peque\u00f1os romances, su coraz\u00f3n todav\u00eda pertenece a Fermina. Cuando al fin el esposo de ella muere, Florentino acude al funeral con toda intenci\u00f3n. A los cincuenta a\u00f1os, nueve meses y cuatro d\u00edas de haberle profesado amor a Fermina, lo har\u00e1; una vez m\u00e1s.<br />Con sagacidad humor\u00edstica y depurado estilo, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez traza la historia excepcional de un amor que no ha sido correspondido por medio siglo. Aunque nunca parece estar propiamente contenido, el amor fluye a trav\u00e9s de la novela de mil maneras: alegre, melanc\u00f3lico, enriquecedor, siempre sorprendente.",

Broke and unsure as to his next meal, he meets Hubert, an incompetent, freshly-released, one-armed armed robber, and the \"thought gang\" is born. Applying philosophy to larceny, these unlikely bandits question the meaning of life, the value of money, and the role of banks as they wind their way from Montpellier to Toulon in search of the greatest heist in history. Unexpected and volatile, The Thought Gang is the hilarious and thought-provoking story of their travails.",

    "description": "E.E. Cummings is without question one of the major poets of this century, and this volume, first published in 1959, is indispensable for every lover of modern lyrical verse. It contains one hundred of Cummings\u2019s wittiest and most profound poems, harvested from thirty-five of the most radically creative years in contemporary American poetry. These poems exhibit all the extraordinary lyricism, playfulness, technical ingenuity, and compassion for which Cummings is famous. They demonstrate beautifully his extrapolations from traditional poetic structures and his departures from them, as well as the unique synthesis of lavish imagery and acute artistic precision that has won him the adulation and respect of critics and poetry lovers everywhere.",

    "description": "<i>Acid Dreams</i> is the complete social history of LSD and the counterculture it helped to define in the sixties. Martin Lee and Bruce Shlain's exhaustively researched and astonishing account\u2014part of it gleaned from secret government files\u2014tells how the CIA became obsessed with LSD as an espionage weapon during the early 1950s and launched a massive covert research program, in which countless unwitting citizens were used as guinea pigs. Though the CIA was intent on keeping the drug to itself, it ultimately couldn't prevent it from spreading into the popular culture; here LSD had a profound impact and helped spawn a political and social upheaval that changed the face of America. From the clandestine operations of the government to the escapades of Timothy Leary, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17245.Abbie_Hoffman\" title=\"Abbie Hoffman\" rel=\"nofollow\">Abbie Hoffman</a>, Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters, Allen Ginsberg, and many others, <i>Acid Dreams</i> provides an important and entertaining account that goes to the heart of a turbulent period in our history.",

    "description": "How can some people come to believe that their poodle is an impostor? Or see colors in numbers? Internationally acclaimed neuroscientist, V.S. Ramachandran, now shares his unique insight into human consciousness in an entertaining, inspiring, and intellectually dazzling brief tour of the ultimate frontier\u2014the thoughts in our heads.<b>A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness</b> is made up of five investigations of the greatest mysteries of the brain. The first chapter shows how amputees feel pain in limbs they no longer have as it introduces the great revolution of our age: neuroscience. The second chapter walks through the way what we see determines our thoughts, and demonstrates the counterintuitive point that believing is in fact seeing. The third chapter takes a leap beyond cutting edge science to audaciously set out a general theory of beauty, explaining why, the world over, cultures have fundamentally similar notions of what is attractive. The fourth chapter explores the bizarre world of synesthetes, people who see colors in numbers, textures in smells, sounds in sights, and flavors in sounds. Finally, V. S. Ramachandran one of the foremost brain researchers in the world today, sums up the implications of the revolution in our understanding of consciousness, to make a fascinating argument about our essential sense of self and its distributed nature.",

    "description": "Charles Strickland, a conventional stockbroker, abandons his wife and children for Paris and Tahiti, to live his life as a painter. Whilst his betrayal of family, duty and honour gives him the freedom to achieve greatness, his decision leads to an obsession which carries severe implications. Inspired by the life of Paul Gauguin, <i>The Moon and Sixpence</i> is at once a satiric caricature of Edwardian conventions and a vivid portrayal of the mentality of a genius.",

    "description": "Welcome to another typical summer in Florida, the season of the storms. Serge storms.<br /><br />That lovable, <em>under</em>-undermedicated dispenser of truth, justice, and trivia is back with a vengeance. And not a weirdness-laced moment too soon.<br /><br />His cherished home state is about to take a beating, and from far more than the way-too-routine conga line of hurricanes bearing down on the peninsula. Bodies have begun turning up at a disturbing rate, even for Florida, and it looks like a brutal serial killer is on the loose, which highly offends Serge's moral sensibilities and he vows to stop at nothing in his juggernaut to make All Things Right . . . except if he gets bored or distracted by a cool souvenir or . . . or a . . . whatever.<br /><br />But his path won't be obstacle free.<br /><br />Agent Mahoney has picked up the scent. The obsessive criminal profiler\u2014just released from a mental hospital where he'd been sent for getting too deep inside Serge's head\u2014is convinced there is no second killer. Serge's personality is simply splitting from decades of burning with incandescent zest for everything under the sun. Then there's Coleman, whose triathlete approach to the sport of polyabuse binging just might derail the mission more than the entire police community put together.<br /><br />The pace picks up. Winds howl, TV reporters fly around the beach, the Party Parrot parties on, and questions mount: Who's stalking Tampa Bay's most sensitive journalist? Did Tom Cruise go too easy on Matt Lauer? Do multiple orgasms improve storm tracking? Why is the feeding-tube guy so quiet? Will Molly ruin our antihero's dreams of playing the electric guitar better than Clapton? . . . All of which ultimately leads to the most pressing question on everyone's new-millennium lips:<br /><br />What would Serge do?",

During the conversation, other questions are raised: what is goodness?; what is reality?; and what is knowledge? The Republic also addresses the purpose of education and the role of both women and men as guardians of the people. With remarkable lucidity and deft use of allegory, Plato arrives at a depiction of a state bound by harmony and ruled by philosopher kings.",

    "description": "Professional debunker Rob, proprietor of the Jaundiced Eye magazine, considers himself incredibly lucky to have Kildy as his sole employee. Smart, dedicated, gorgeous, and, thanks to her last movie before she hung up on Hollywood, rich, she's a pleasure to oblige when she says Rob has to witness this channeler Ariaura's act--on her, not the Eye's, nickel--despite channelers being so last year. It's quite a show, all right, for in the midst of Ariaura's particular ancient wise guy's basso spiel, a gravelly baritone interrupts (both voices emanate from the channeler's female mouth) to berate the audience as \"yaps\" and the act as \"claptrap.\" Why is Ariaura undermining herself? Or is she? After all, she angrily accuses Rob and Kildy of scheming to destroy her. Could the baritone belong to a genuine channeled spirit? Willis, one of sf's most spirited writers, rounds on the New Age; pays tribute to a great, skeptical journalist; and affectionately parodies pulp fiction at its best in this irresistible entertainment.",

Back home, their adventures are followed by countless breathless fans, but the reality is far less romantic as they deal with dust, nitpicking regulations, and uncooperative aliens. Teamed with a young intern whose specialty is mating customs, and a native guide of indeterminate gender, the group sets out for a previously unexplored sector of the planet. As they survey canyons and cataracts, battle dangers, and discover alien treasures, they will soon find themselves in alien territory of another kind: exploring the paths and precipices of sex. And love.",

    "description": "With the publication of <b>Bright Lights, Big City</b> in 1984, Jay McInerney became a literary sensation, heralded as the voice of a generation. The novel follows a young man, living in Manhattan as if he owned it, through nightclubs, fashion shows, editorial offices, and loft parties as he attempts to outstrip mortality and the recurring approach of dawn. With nothing but goodwill, controlled substances, and wit to sustain him in this anti-quest, he runs until he reaches his reckoning point, where he is forced to acknowledge loss and, possibly, to rediscover his better instincts. This remarkable novel of youth and New York remains one of the most beloved, imitated, and iconic novels in America.",

Filtered through the consciousness of the novel's narrator, Ishmael, Moby-Dick draws us into a universe full of fascinating characters and stories, from the noble cannibal Queequeg to the natural history of whales, while reaching existential depths that excite debate and contemplation to this day. <br /><br />The Modern Library Classics edition contains original illustrations by Rockwell Kent.<br /><br />Introduction by Elizabeth Hardwick.",

    "description": "When Nick Drake (1948-1974) died of a drug overdose at twenty-six, he left behind three modest-selling albums, including the stark <i>Pink Moon</i> and the lush <i>Bryter Layter</i>. Three decades later, he is recognized as one of the true geniuses of English acoustic music. Yet Nick Drake--whose music was as gentle and melancholy as the man himself-- has always maintained a spectral presence in popular music. This groundbreaking biography reconstructs a vanished life while perfectly capturing the bohemian scenes surrounding the music business in London in the late '60s and early '70s. Using many newly discovered documents and all-new interviews, Trevor Dann reveals more detail on Nick Drake than ever, from his upbringing in a quintessentially English village, through his hash-fueled school days at Cambridge University, to the missed opportunities and mismanagement that defined his career. Friends and colleagues describe the difficulties that he faced as each new album was released, only to fail, and the insidious despair that consumed him. Complete with discography and rare photos, <i>Darker Than the Deepest Sea</i> is essential reading for anyone who has been moved by Nick Drake's unforgettable blend of beauty and sadness.",

    "description": "Galileo, Copernicus, Newton, Niels Bohr, Einstein. Their insights shook our perception of who we are and where we stand in the world, and in their wake have left an uneasy coexistence: science vs. religion, faith vs. empirical inquiry. Which is the keeper of truth? Which is the true path to understanding reality?<br /><br />After forty years of study with some of the greatest scientific minds, as well as a lifetime of meditative, spiritual, and philosophic study, the Dalai Lama presents a brilliant analysis of why all avenues of inquiry\u2014scientific as well as spiritual\u2014must be pursued in order to arrive at a complete picture of the truth. Through an examination of Darwinism and karma, quantum mechanics and philosophical insight into the nature of reality, neurobiology and the study of consciousness, the Dalai Lama draws significant parallels between contemplative and scientific examinations of reality.<br /><br />This breathtakingly personal examination is a tribute to the Dalai Lama\u2019s teachers\u2014both of science and spirituality. The legacy of this book is a vision of the world in which our different approaches to understanding ourselves, our universe, and one another can be brought together in the service of humanity.",

    "description": "Nearly every time you see him, he's laughing, or at least smiling. And he makes everyone else around him feel like smiling. He's the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet, a Nobel Prize winner, and an increasingly popular speaker and statesman. What's more, he'll tell you that happiness is the purpose of life, and that \"the very motion of our life is towards happiness.\" How to get there has always been the question. He's tried to answer it before, but he's never had the help of a psychiatrist to get the message across in a context we can easily understand. Through conversations, stories, and meditations, the Dalai Lama shows us how to defeat day-to-day anxiety, insecurity, anger, and discouragement. Together with Dr. Cutler, he explores many facets of everyday life, including relationships, loss, and the pursuit of wealth, to illustrate how to ride through life's obstacles on a deep and abiding source of inner peace.",

Like his previous bestseller, <i>Buddhism without Beliefs</i>, <i>Living with the Devil</i> is also an introduction to Buddhism that encourages readers to nourish their \"buddha nature\" and make peace with the devils that haunt human life. He tells a poetic and provocative tale about living with life's contradictions that will challenge you to live your life as an existence imbued with purpose, freedom, and compassion\u2014rather than habitual self-interest and fear.",

    "description": "How can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology-driven lives if we don\u2019t understand the difference between the myths of pseudoscience and the testable hypotheses of science? Pulitzer Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions.<br /><br />Casting a wide net through history and culture, Sagan examines and authoritatively debunks such celebrated fallacies of the past as witchcraft, faith healing, demons, and UFOs. And yet, disturbingly, in today's so-called information age, pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction, channeling past lives, and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect. As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence, the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms.",

    "description": "Shunryu Suzuki is known to countless readers as the author of the modern spiritual classic <b>Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</b>. This most influential teacher comes vividly to life in <b>Crooked Cucumber</b>, the first full biography of any Zen master to be published in the West. To make up his intimate and engrossing narrative, David Chadwick draws on Suzuki's own words and the memories of his students, friends, and family. Interspersed with previously unpublished passages from Suzuki's talks, <b>Crooked Cucumber</b> evokes a down-to-earth life of the spirit. Along with Suzuki we can find a way to \"practice with mountains, trees, and stones and to find ourselves in this big world.\"",

A modern Israeli Madame Bovary.\u201d\u2014<i>New York Times Book Review</i><br /><br />Set in 1950s Jerusalem, My Michael is the story of a remote and intense woman named Hannah Gonen and her marriage to a decent but unremarkable man named Michael. As the years pass and Hannah\u2019s tempestuous fantasy life encroaches upon reality, she feels increasingly estranged from him and the marriage gradually disintegrates. Gorgeously written, profoundly moving, this extraordinary novel is at once a haunting love story, and a rich reflective portrait of a place.<br /><br />\"A dazzling, very beautiful, splendidly conceived and composed book.\" \u2014<i>New York Review of Books</i>",

    "description": "For almost 1,500 years, the New Testament manuscripts were copied by hand\u2013\u2013and mistakes and intentional changes abound in the competing manuscript versions. Religious and biblical scholar Bart Ehrman makes the provocative case that many of our widely held beliefs concerning the divinity of Jesus, the Trinity, and the divine origins of the Bible itself are the results of both intentional and accidental alterations by scribes.<br /><br />In this compelling and fascinating book, Ehrman shows where and why changes were made in our earliest surviving manuscripts, explaining for the first time how the many variations of our cherished biblical stories came to be, and why only certain versions of the stories qualify for publication in the Bibles we read today. Ehrman frames his account with personal reflections on how his study of the Greek manuscripts made him abandon his once ultra\u2013conservative views of the Bible.",

    "description": "Israel's newest prime minister as of February 6, 2001, Ariel Sharon is a dynamic and controversial leader. A hero in Israel's wars, perhaps the most daring and successful commander in Israel's extraordinary military history, Sharon has always been a warrior, whether the enemies were hostile Arab nations, terrorists, <i>Time</i> magazine, or rival politicians. The public man is well known -- aggressive in battle, hard-line in politics -- but the private man has always been obscured by Sharon's dazzling career and powerful personality. In this compelling and dramatic auto-biography, the real Sharon appears for the first time: a complex man, a loving father, a figure of courage and compassion. He is a warrior who commands the respect and love of his troops, a visionary, and an uncompromising, ruthless pragmatist. <p> Sharon tells his story with frankness, power, intelligence, and a brilliant gift for detail. Always controversial, he is as outspoken as his friends -- and enemies -- would expect him to be.</p>",

    "description": "When The Universe Next Door was first introduced nearly thirty years ago, it set the standard for a clear, readable introduction to worldviews. In concise, easily understood prose, James W. Sire explained the basics of theism, deism, naturalism, nihilism, existentialism, Eastern monism and the new consciousness.The second edition was updated and expanded to include sections on Marxism and secular humanism, as well as a completely reworked chapter on what is now widely known as New Age philosophy rather than new consciousness. And the third edition offered further updating and revisions, including a thoroughly revised chapter on New Age philosophy and, perhaps most importantly, a new chapter on postmodernism.Now the fourth edition refines the definition of worldview itself, incorporating Sire's thinking and teaching during the past decade. (His recent work is showcased in a new book, Naming the Elephant, also published by IVP.) The Universe Next Door has been translated into several languages and has been used as a text at over one hundred colleges and universities in courses ranging from apologetics and world religions to history and English literature. With the publication of the fourth edition, this book will continue to aid students, teachers and anyone who wants to understand the variety of worldviews that compete with Christianity for the allegiance of our minds and hearts.",

    "description": "The New York Times calls him \"America's number one Buddhist.\" He is the co-founder of Tibet House New York, was the first American Tibetan Buddhist monk, and has shared a thirty-five-year friendship with the Dalai Lama. Now, <b>Robert Thurman</b> presents his first completely original book, an introduction to Buddhism and\u00a0\"an inspiring guide to incorporating Buddhist wisdom into daily life\" (USA Today). Written with insight, enthusiasm, and impeccable scholarship, <b>Inner Revolution </b>is not only a national bestseller and\u00a0practical primer on one of the world's most fascinating traditions, but\u00a0it is also\u00a0a wide-ranging look at the course of our civilization--and how we can alter it for the better. \"Part spiritual memoir, part philosophical treatise and part religious history, Thurman's book is a passionate declaration of the possibilities of renewing the world\" (Publishers Weekly, starred review).",

    "description": "The bestselling author of \"Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart\" combines a memoir of his own journey as a student of Buddhism and psychology with a powerful message about how cultivating true self-awareness and adopting a Buddhist understanding of change can free the mind. <br />Before Mark Epstein became a medical student at Harvard and began training as a psychiatrist, he immersed himself in Buddhism through experiences with such influential Buddhist teachers as Ram Dass, Joseph Goldstein, and Jack Kornfield. The positive outlook of Buddhism and the meditative principle of living in the moment came to influence his study and practice of psychotherapy profoundly. \"Going on Being \"is Epstein's memoir of his early years as a student of Buddhism and of how Buddhism shaped his approach to therapy, as well as a practical guide to how a Buddhist understanding of psychological problems makes change for the better possible. <br />\"Going on Being \"is an intimate chronicle of the evolution of spirit and psyche, and a highly inviting guide for anyone seeking a new path and a new outlook on life.",

    "description": "<b>Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Great New Writers</b><br />Okay, you're thinking, this must be some kind of a joke. A humorous book about cadavers? Yup, and it works. Mary Roach takes the age-old question, \"What happens to us after we die?\" quite literally. And in <i>Stiff,</i> she explores the \"lives\" of human cadavers from the time of the ancient Egyptians all the way up to current campaigns for human composting. Along the way, she recounts with morbidly infectious glee how dead bodies are used for research ranging from car safety and plastic surgery (you'll cancel your next collagen injection after reading this!), to the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin.<p> <br /><br />Impossible (and irreverent) as it may sound, Roach has written a book about corpses that's both lively and fresh. She traveled around the globe to conduct her forensic investigations, and her findings are wryly intelligent. While the myriad uses for cadavers recounted are often graphic, Roach imbues her subject with a sense of dignity, choosing to emphasize the oddly noble purposes corpses serve, from organ donation to lifesaving medical research. Readers will come away convinced of the enormous debt that we, the living, owe to the study of the remains of the dead. And while it may not offer the answer to the ancient mystery we were hoping for, <i>Stiff</i> offers a strange sort of comfort in the knowledge that, in a sense, death isn't necessarily the end. <br /><br /><i>(Spring 2003 Selection)</i></p>",

    "description": "Writing with bracing intelligence and clarity, internationally renowned evolutionist and bestselling author Stephen Jay Gould sheds new light on a dilemma that has plagued thinking people since the Renaissance: the rift between science and religion. Instead of choosing them, Gould asks, why not opt for a golden mean that accords dignity and distinction to each realm? <br /><br />In his distinctively elegant style, Gould offers a lucid, contemporary principle that allows science and religion to coexist peacefully in a position of respectful noninterference. Science defines the natural world; religion our moral world in recognition of their separate spheres of influence. In exploring this thought-provoking concept, Gould delves into the history of science, sketching affecting portraits of scientists and moral leaders wrestling with matters of faith and reason. Stories of seminal figures such as Galileo, Darwin, and Thomas Henry Huxley make vivid his argument that individuals and cultures must cultivate both a life of the spirit and a life of rational inquiry in order to experience the fullness of being human. <br /><br />In <i>Rocks of Ages</i>, Gould's passionate humanism, ethical discernment, and erudition are fused to create a dazzling gem of contemporary cultural philosophy.",

    "description": "Those opposed to the teaching of evolution often make well-rehearsed claims about the science that <i>sound </i>powerful and convincing. And many people who support the teaching of evolution\u2014students, teachers, parents, administrators\u2014do not have the background to respond. They know that scientists have thoroughly dismantled these arguments, but they don't have a handy way of responding to these attacks. <i>The Counter-Creationism Handbook </i>is a one-stop resource for addressing over 400 of the most prevalent claims made by creationists. Each claim is followed by a succinct and scientifically valid rebuttal, and the book includes print and on-line resources for further reading and information. <br /><br /><i>The Counter-Creationism Handbook:</i><br /><br />* Covers claims made about the disciplines of philosophy, biology, paleontology, geology, astronomy, physics and mathematics, history, and more.<br /><br />* Addresses the claims of Biblical creationism, intelligent design creationism, and some creationism based on non-Christian religions.<br /><br />* Includes an introduction on how to address creationists in different venues, how to deal with novel claims, and why accurate science is important.<br /><br />* Is organized thematically, with extensive cross-referencing.",

    "description": "In the last fifteen years a controversial new theory of the origins of biological complexity and the nature of the universe has been fomenting bitter debates in education and science policy across North America, Europe, and Australia. Backed by intellectuals at respectable universities, <em>Intelligent Design Theory</em> (ID) proposes an alternative to accepted accounts of evolutionary theory: that life is so complex, and that the universe is so fine-tuned for the appearance of life, that the only plausible explanation is the existence of an intelligent designer. For many ID theorists, the designer is taken to be the god of Christianity.<br /><br />Niall Shanks has written the first accessible introduction to, and critique of, this controversial new intellectual movement. Shanks locates the growth of ID in the last two decades of the twentieth century in the growing influence of the American religious right. But as he shows, its roots go back beyond Aquinas to Ancient Greece. After looking at the historical roots of ID, Shanks takes a hard look at its intellectual underpinnings, discussing modern understandings of thermodynamics, and how self-organizing processes lead to complex physical, chemical, and biological systems. He considers cosmological arguments for ID rooted in so-called \"anthropic coincidences\" and also tackles new biochemical arguments for ID based on \"irreducible biological complexity.\" Throughout he shows how arguments for ID lack cohesion, rest on errors and unfounded suppositions, and generally are grossly inferior to evolutionary explanations.<br /><br />While ID has been proposed as a scientific alternative to evolutionary biology, Shanks argues that ID is in fact \"old creationist wine in new designer label bottles\" and moreover is a serious threat to the scientific and democratic values that are our cultural and intellectual inheritance from the Enlightenment.<br />",

Sections between chapters gently guide readers through Zen mediation practices, explaining the basics in a clear, engaging way. One key chapter places <i>Christian and Zen</i> teachings side by side to help Christian readers not only understand Zen but appreciate what it has to offer them.</p><p><i>Zen for Christians</i> illustrates how Zen practice can be particularly useful for Christians who want to enrich their faith by incorporating contemplative practices.</p>",

    "description": "Paul Kimmage's boyhood dreams were of cycling glory - winning races, wearing the yellow jersey, cycling the Tour de France, becoming a national hero. He knew it wouldn't come easy, he was prepared to put in the graft and so he spent his teenage years cycling an average of 100 miles a week. The dedication began to pay off. He won junior races, represented his country and in 1984 he became a professional cyclist. That's when reality hit. He soon discovered that it wasn't about glory and courage and it wasn't about how much training you put in or how much you wanted to succeed. It was about gruelling defeats, complete and utter exhaustion, and, it was about drugs. Not drugs that would ensure victory but drugs that would allow you to finish the race and start another day.Paul Kimmage left the sport to write this book. It is a powerful and frank account that breaks the law of silence that surrounds the issue of drugs in sport. An eye-opening expose and a heartbreaking lament it is a book that any person interested in any sport should read.",

    "description": "Ellen J. Langer, Harvard professor of psychology, determines that the mindless following of routine and other automatic behaviors lead to much error, pain and a predetermined course of life. In this thought-provoking book, her research has been \"translated\" for the lay reader. With anecdotes and metaphors, Langer explains how the mindless--as opposed to the mindful--develop mindsets of categories, associations, habits of thought born of repetition in childhood and throughout schooling. To be mindful, she notes, stressing process over outcome, allows free rein to intuition and creativity, and opens us to new information and perspectives.<br /><br /> Langer discusses the negative impact of mindsets on business and social relations, showing special concern for the elderly, who often suffer from learned helplessness and lack of options. Encouraging the application of mindfulness to health, the author affirms that placebos and alternative, mind-based therapies can help patients and addicts move from unhealthy to healthy contexts.",

    "description": "According to Eknath Easwaran, if all of the Buddhist sutras had been lost except the <i>Dhammapada</i>, it alone would be enough for readers to understand and appreciate the wisdom of the Buddha. Easwaran's version of the <i>Dhammapada</i> goes a long way toward proving this. In a lengthy introduction, Easwaran summarizes the life of the Buddha and the main tenets of his thought, including key concepts such as dharma, karma, and nirvana. The language of the Dhammapada is as lucid and flowing as the Psalms or the Sermon on the Mount, and this is why it is one of the most loved and remembered of all Buddhist sutras. Its subject matter, succinctly, is about training the mind, which leads to kind thoughts and deeds, which bring peace and freedom from suffering. If you are interested in reading one of the gems of Buddhist literature, this is a good place to start; and if you are looking for a great version of this beloved scripture, you can't do better. Like all great world scripture, the verses here reward rereading and reflection, prompting you to \"strive for wisdom always.\" <i>--Brian Bruya</i>",

    "description": "Originally published in 1978, Webb's classic novel of the Vietnam War follows three soldiers from different worlds who are plunged into a white-hot murderous realm of jungle warfare as it was fought by one Marine platoon in the An Hoa Basin in 1969.<br /><br />'They each had their reasons for being a soldier. They each had their illusions. Goodrich came from Harvard. Snake got the tattoo \u2014 Death Before Dishonor \u2014 before he got the uniform. And Hodges was haunted by the ghosts of family heroes.<br /><br />They had no way of knowing what awaited them. Nothing could have prepared them for the madness to come. And in the heat and horror of battle they took on new identities, took on each other, and were each reborn in fields of fire....<br /><br /><b>Fields of Fire</b> is James Webb\u2019s classic, searing novel of the Vietnam War, a novel of poetic power, razor-sharp observation, and agonizing human truths seen through the prism of nonstop combat. Weaving together a cast of vivid characters, <b>Fields of Fire</b> captures the journey of unformed men through a man-made hell \u2014 until each man finds his fate.'",

    "description": "After more than twenty years of running Barefoot Contessa, the acclaimed specialty food store, Ina Garten published her first collection of recipes. <i>The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook</i> was an overnight sensation, but it's the kind of success that can only be grounded in years of experience. In it, Ina shared her ideas for familiar food but with outstanding flavor and -- most important of all -- recipes that really work.<br /><br />Now, with <i>Barefoot Contessa Parties!</i> Ina shares secrets she has gleaned from her years not only as a caterer but as a dedicated party giver. The keyword here is fun. Ina's parties are easy to prepare and fun for everyone, including the host. Forget those boring Saturday-night dinners that just won't end. With Ina's advice, you're certain to have all your friends saying, \"Wasn't that fun!\"<br /><br />Ina has packed <i>Barefoot Contessa Parties!</i> with plans for pulling off parties like a pro, stories about her own parties, and tips on assembling food (rather than cooking everything) and organizing like a caterer. In the spring you can invite your friends to a party where they all make their own pizzas. Come summer, it's into the garden for a lunch with grilled lamb and pita sandwiches that guests assemble themselves. In the autumn, when it's not Thanksgiving, Ina roasts a fresh turkey, which her friends enjoy with popovers and a creamy spinach gratin. And on a snowy winter's day, everyone is invited for a lunch buffet with seafood chowder and butternut squash and apple soup.<br /><br />Ever since Ina published her first book, people write, e-mail, and stop her on the street to say how much they love the food. She's reached new heights here with recipes like sour cream coffee cake--the ultimate breakfast treat. Salads? The red lettuce, balsamic onions, and blue cheese; Chinese chicken salad; and panzanella may be the best you've ever tasted. Filet of beef is easy to make for a fancy dinner with oh-so-good gorgonzola sauce, or sliced into sandwiches and served with lobster rolls for a Superbowl party. And fans of <i>The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook</i> will be delighted to find the recipe for the Lemon Cake they drooled over but only saw pictured, right here in this book.<br /><br />With so many great ideas and recipes in these pages for you to use, your friends will start to wonder why your parties are always so much fun.",
