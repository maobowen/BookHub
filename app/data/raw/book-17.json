    "description": "The time when \"fashion\" was defined by French designers whose clothes could be afforded only by elite has ended. Now designers take their cues from mainstream consumers and creativity is channeled more into mass-marketing clothes than into designing them. Indeed, one need look no further than the Gap to see proof of this. In <em> The End of Fashion, Wall Street Journal</em>, reporter Teri Agins astutely explores this seminal change, laying bare all aspects of the fashion industry from manufacturing, retailing, anmd licensing to image making and financing. Here as well are fascinating insider vignettes that show Donna Karan fighting with financiers,the rivalry between Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger, and the commitment to haute conture that sent Isaac Mizrahi's business spiraling.",

    "description": "In the last gasp of youth, Simon \"Sick Boy\" Williamson is back in Edinburgh. He taps into one last great scam: directing and producing a porn film. To make it work, he needs bedfellows: the lovely Nikki Fuller-Smith, a student with ambition, ego, and troubles to rival his own; old pal Mark Renton; and a motley crew that includes the neighborhood's favorite ex-beverage salesman, \"Juice\" Terry.<br /><br /><br />In the world of <em>Porno</em>, however, even the cons are conned. Sick Boy and Renton jockey for top dog. The out-of-jail and in-for-revenge Begbie is on the loose. But it's the hapless, drug-addled Spud who may be spreading the most trouble.<br /><br /><em>Porno</em> is a novel about the <em>Trainspotting</em> crew ten years further down the line: still scheming, still scamming, still fighting for the first-class seats as the train careens at high velocity with derailment looming around the next corner.",

    "description": "At the centre of pratically every major debate over America?s role in the world, one finds Noam Chomsky?s ideas - sometimes attacked, sometimes studiously ignored, but always a powerful presence. Drawing from his published and unpublished work, The Chomsky Reader reveals the awesome range of this ever-critical mind - from global questions of war and peace to the most intricate questions of human intelligence, IQ and creativity. It reveals the underlying radical coherency of his view of the world - from his enormously influential attacks on America?s role in Vietnam to his perspective on Nicaragua and Central America Today. Chomsky?s challenges to accepted wisdom about Israel and the Palestinians has caused a furore in America, as have his trenchant essays on the real nature of terrorism in our age. No one has dissected more graphically the character of the cold war consensus and the way it benefits the two superpowers, and argued more thoughtfully for a shared elitist ethos in liberalism and communism. No one has exposed more logically America?s acclaimed freedoms as masking irresponsible power and unjustified privilege, or argued quite so insistently that the ?free press? is part of a stultifying conformity that pervades all aspects of American intellectual life.",

    "description": "The war on drugs is powerfully dramatized in Winslow's ambitious, dense and gritty latest (after 1999's California Fire and Life). Art Keller is a brilliant DEA agent who sometimes breaks the rules to serve justice. Adan Barrera is an urbane drug dealer whose charm masks his brutality. Nora Hayden is a high-class call girl whose heart is in the right place. And Sean Callan is a taciturn mob hit man, a stone-cold killer who just wants out of the life. Winslow follows these four characters and assorted extras as they cross paths over three decades in the international drug trade, from Keller's first encounter with Barrera in 1970s Mexico, through the drug cartels' corruption of government officials in the U.S. and Mexico governments, to a final showdown on the U.S. border in 1999. Winslow's depth of research and unflagging attention to detail give the story both heft and immediacy, and his staccato, present-tense prose shifts easily among wildly disparate settings and multiple points of view. A complex plot, well-drawn characters and plenty of double-crossing make this a thinking person's narco-thriller. Agent, Jimmy Vines. Author tour. (May)",

The rabbit was very pleased with himself, and for good reason: he was owned by a girl named Abilene, who treated him with the utmost care and adored him completely. <br /><br />And then, one day, he was lost. <br /><br />Kate DiCamillo takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the depths of the ocean to the net of a fisherman, from the top of a garbage heap to the fireside of a hoboes' camp, from the bedside of an ailing child to the bustling streets of Memphis. And along the way, we are shown a true miracle \u2014 that even a heart of the most breakable kind can learn to love, to lose, and to love again.",

    "description": "Was Jesus born of a virgin? Did he know he was the Messiah? Was he bodily resurrected from the dead? Did he intentionally die to redeem humankind? Was Jesus God?<br /><br />In The Meaning of Jesus two leading Jesus scholars with widely divergent views go right to the heart of these questions and others, presenting the opposing visions of Jesus that shape our faith today.<br /><br />In alternating chapters, Marcus Borg, the most popular revisionist voice on Jesus and a member of the Jesus Seminar, and N. T. Wright, the most prominent standard-bearer for the traditional stance and an outspoken critic of the Jesus Seminar, present their views of who Jesus was, what he taught, and what he did.<br /><br />Candid, spirited, and thoughtfully debated, this compelling discourse will stimulate fresh ideas and intense dialogue among anyone concerned with what it means to be a Christian today.",

    "description": "Born in Bermuda to a house slave in 1788, Mary Prince suffered the first of many soul-shattering experiences in her life when she was separated from her parents and siblings at the age of twelve. Subjected to bodily and sexual abuse by subsequent masters, she was bought and sold several times before she was ultimately freed.<br />The first black woman to break the bonds of slavery in the British colonies and publish a record of her experiences, Prince vividly recalls her life in the West Indies, her rebellion against physical and psychological degradation, and her eventual escape in 1828 in England. Her straightforward, often poetic account of immense anguish, separation from her husband, and struggle for freedom inflamed public opinion during a period when stormy debates on abolition were common in both the United States and England.<br />This edition also includes a substantial supplement by Thomas Pringle, the original editor, as well as another brief slave account: \u201cThe Narrative of Asa-Asa, a Captured African.\u201d<br />Essential reading for students of African-American studies, Mary Prince\u2019s classic account of determination and endurance aids in filling the many gaps in black women\u2019s history.",

    "description": "To serial slayer Andrew Compton, murder is an art, <i>the most intimate art</i>. After feigning his own death to escape from prison, Compton makes his way to the United States with the sole ambition of bringing his \"art\" to new heights. Tortured by his own perverse desires, and drawn to possess and destroy young boys, Compton inadvertently joins forces with Jay Byrne, a dissolute playboy who has pushed his \"art\" to limits even Compton hadn't previously imagined. Together, Compton and Byrne set their sights on an exquisite young Vietnamese-American runaway, Tran, whom they deem to be the perfect victim.<br /><br />Swiftly moving from the grimy streets of London's Piccadilly Circus to the decadence of the New Orleans French Quarter, and punctuated by rants from radio talk show host Lush Rimbaud, a.k.a. Luke Ransom, Tran's ex-lover, who is dying of AIDS and who intends to wreak ultimate havoc before leaving this world, <i>Exquisite Corpse</i> unfolds into a labyrinth of murder and love. Ultimately all four characters converge on a singular bloody night after which their lives will be irrevocably changed \u2014 or terminated.<br /><br />Poppy Z. Brite dissects the landscape of torture and invites us into the mind of a killer. <i>Exquisite Corpse</i> confirms Brite as a writer who defies categorization. It is a novel for those who dare trespass where the sacred and profane become one.",

    "description": "For all those seeking more authentic ways to hold and practice Christian faith, Brian McLaren has been an inspiring, compassionate--and provocative--voice. Starting with the award-winning <i>A New Kind of Christian, </i> McLaren offered a lively, wide-ranging fictional conversation between Pastor Dan Poole and his friend Neil Oliver as they reflected about faith, doubt, reason, mission, leadership, and spiritual practice in the emerging postmodern world. That conversation widened to include several intriguing new characters in the sequel, <i>The Story We Find Ourselves In, </i> as Dan and friends continued to explore faith-stretching themes from evolution to evangelism, from death to the meaning of life. Now, in this third installment of their adventures, Dan and his widening circle of friends grapple with conventional Christian teachings about hell and judgment and what they mean for our relationship with God and each other. Is there an alternative to the usual polar views of a just God short on mercy or a merciful God short on justice? Could our conflicted views of hell be symptoms of a deeper set of problems - misunderstandings about what God's justice and mercy are about, misconceptions about God's purpose in creating the world, deep misgivings about what kind of character God is and what the Christian gospel is for?",

    "description": "<b>Be Transformed by Christ\u2019s Example</b> <br /><br />\u201cGod opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.\u201d \u20141 Peter 5:5 <br /><br />A battle rages within every one of us every day. It\u2019s the clash between our sense of stubborn self-sufficiency and God\u2019s call to recognize that we\u2019re really nothing without Him. It\u2019s pride versus humility. And it\u2019s a fight we can\u2019t win without looking repeatedly to Christ and the cross. C. J. Mahaney raises a battle cry to daily, diligently, and deliberately weaken our greatest enemy (pride) and cultivate our greatest friend (humility). His examination clarifies misconceptions, revealing the truth about why God detests pride and turns His active attention to the humble. Because pride is never passive, defeating it demands an intentional attack. The blessing that follows is God\u2019s abundant favor. <br /><br />\u201cThis is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit.\u201d <br />\u2014Isaiah 66:2,\u00a0ESV <br /><br />God clearly states that He is drawn to the humble. He\u2019s also clear that He opposes the proud. These two, humility and pride, cannot coexist. Where one is fostered, the other is defeated. <br /><br />Which will you pursue?",

But her memoir, bound to become a classic, tells the story in a funny, ironic, unforgettable voice that \"isn't all grim; Scholinski tells her story in beautifully evocative prose and mines her experiences for every last drop of ironic humor, determined to have the last laugh.\" (<i>Time Out New York</i>)",

Martin lives in a small English village, where he studies his hero and putters about harmlessly\u2014until an ambitious outsider, Nick Marshall, is appointed postmaster instead of Martin. Slick and self-assured, Nick steals Martin's girlfriend and decides to modernize the friendly local office by firing dedicated but elderly employees and privatizing the business. Suddenly, gentle Martin is faced with a choice: meekly accept defeat as he always has, or fight for what he believes in, as his hero, Hemingway, would.<br /><br />Filled with Michael Palin's trademark wit and good humor, this novel is for anyone who has ever dreamed of triumphing over the technocrats and backstabbers of the world. Hilarious, touching, and ultimately inspirational,<i> Hemingway's Chair</i> will make readers stand up and cheer.",

At the center is George Willard, a young reporter who becomes the confidant of the town's solitary figures.

    "description": "In this debut work by New York Times-bestselling author Paul Auster (The New York Trilogy), The Invention of Solitude, a memoir, established Auster\u2019s reputation as a major new voice in American writing. His moving and personal meditation on fatherhood is split into two stylistically separate sections. In the first, Auster reflects on the memories of his father who was a distant, undemonstrative, and cold man who died an untimely death. As he sifts through his Father\u2019s things, Auster uncovers a sixty-year-old murder mystery that sheds light on his father\u2019s elusive character. In the second section, the perspective shifts and Auster begins to reflect on his own identity as a father by adopting the voice of a narrator, \u201cA.\u201d Through a mosaic of images, coincidences, and associations \u201cA,\u201d contemplates his separation from his son, his dying grandfather, turning the story into a self-conscious reflection on the process of writing",

    "description": "<i>\"We need others physically, emotionally, intellectually; we need them if we are to know anything, even ourselves.\"</i><br /><br />We hear often that love is patient and kind, not envious or prideful. We hear that human love is a reflection of divine love. We hear that God is love. But how do we understand its work in our lives, its perils and rewards? Here, the incomparable C. S. Lewis examines human love in four forms: affection, the most basic, general, and emotive; friendship, the most rare, least jealous, and, in being freely chosen, perhaps the most profound; Eros, passionate love that can run counter to happiness and poses real danger; charity, the greatest, most spiritual, and least selfish. Proper love is a risk, but to bar oneself from it--to deny love--is a damning choice. Love is a need and a gift; love brings joy and laughter. We must seek to be awakened and so to find an Appreciative love through which \"all things are possible.\"<br /><br />\"<i>The Four Loves</i> deserves to become a minor classic as a modern mirror of our souls, a mirror of the virtues and failings of human loving.\" \u2014<i>New York Times Book Review</i><br /><br />\"Lewis has a keen eye, a large measure of human sympathy, wit, and a command of simple words.\" \u2014<i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br /><br /><b>C. S. (Clive Staples) Lewis</b> (1898-1963), one of the great writers of the twentieth century, also continues to be one of our most influential Christian thinkers. He wrote more than thirty books, both popular and scholarly, including The Chronicles of Narnia series, <i>The Screwtape Letters</i>, <i>The Four Loves</i>, <i>Mere Christianity</i>, and <i>Surprised by Joy</i>.",

In Lee Child\u2019s astonishing new thriller, Reacher\u2019s arrival will change everything - about a case that isn\u2019t what it seems, about lives tangled in baffling ways, about a killer who missed one shot - and by doing so gives Jack Reacher one shot at the truth....",

Le Carr\u00e9 combined the inside knowledge of his years in British intelligence with the skills of the best novelists to produce a story as taut as it is twisting, unlike any previously experienced, which transports anyone who reads it back to the shadowy years in the early 1960s, when the Berlin Wall went up and the Cold War came to life.<br /><br /><i>The Spy Who Came in From the Cold</i> was hailed as a classic as soon as it was published, and it remains one today.",

While chronicling her evolution as a writer, Ginsberg takes a behind-the-scenes look at restaurant life-revealing that yes, when pushed, a server will spit in food, and, no, that's not really decaf you're getting-and how most people in this business are in a constant state of waiting to do something else.",

Although you may not be aware of it, girlish behaviors such as these are sabotaging your career!<br /><br />Dr. Lois Frankel reveals why some women roar ahead in their careers while others stagnate. She's spotted a unique set of behaviors--101 in all--that women learn in girlhood that sabotage them as adults. Now, in this groudbreaking guide, she helps you eliminate these unconscious mistakes that could be holding you back--and offers invaluable coaching tips you can easily incorporate into your social and business skills. If you recognize and change the behaviors that say \"girl\" not \"woman\", the results will pay off in carrer opportunites you never thought possible--and in an image that identifies you as someone with the power and know-how to occupy the corner office.",

Everywhere you turn people try to tell you who to be and what to do with your life. We call that the noise. Block it. Shed it. Leave it for the conformists. As a generation, we need to get back to focusing on individuality. Self-construction rather than mass production. Define your own road in life instead of traveling down someone else\u2019s. Listen to yourself. Your road is the open road. Find it.\u201d\u2014Mike and Nathan<br /><br /> *****<br /> After college Mike Marriner and Nathan Gebhard had no idea what to do with their lives. All they\u2019d been exposed to were standard career paths like doctor and consultant\u2014roads that didn\u2019t fit them at all.<br /><br /> To see what else was out there they took a roadtrip across the nation in a huge forty-foot RV to meet with people who had successfully defined their own paths in life\u2014including the chairman of Starbucks; a lobsterman from Maine; the director of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>; the conductor of the Boston Philharmonic; the first female Supreme Court Justice of the United States; head stylist for Madonna; and the CEO of National Geographic Ventures. All told, one hundred and forty people candidly shared their stories about how they got from college to the present. Now in <i>Roadtrip Nation</i>, Mike and Nathan share the most compelling tales with you.<br /><br /> Along the way, they explain how you, too, can get out there and meet people on your own. From making cold calls to asking stimulating interview questions, <i>Roadtrip Nation</i> will give you the tools to create a life that you\u2019ll look back on and say: \u201cI was true to myself every step of the way.\u201d",

Their daughter, Blanca, whose forbidden love for a man Esteban has deemed unworthy infuriates her father, yet will produce his greatest joy: his granddaughter Alba, a beautiful, ambitious girl who will lead the family and their country into a revolutionary future.<br /><br /><i>The House of the Spirits</i> is an enthralling saga that spans decades and lives, twining the personal and the political into an epic novel of love, magic, and fate.",

    "description": "THE INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER<br /><br />The prequel to <i>How Hard Can It Be?</i><br /><br />Meet Kate Reddy, fund manager and mother of two. Always time-poor, Kate counts seconds like other women count calories. Factor in a manipulative nanny, an Australian boss who looks at Kate's breasts as if they're on special offer, a long-suffering husband, her quietly aghast in-laws, two needy children and an email lover, and you have a woman juggling so many balls that some day something's going to hit the ground.<br /><br />In an uproariously funny and achingly sad novel, Allison Pearson brilliantly dramatises the dilemma of working motherhood at the start of the twenty-first century.<br /><br /><br />If you could buy stock in a book, I would stake all my savings on the success of <i>I Don't Know How She Does It</i>. Here at last is the definitive social comedy of working motherhood - <i>Washington Post</i><br /><br />Funny, fast and full of nail-on-the-head observations - <i>Daily Telegraph</i>",

    "description": "Jorge Luis Borges has been called the greatest Spanish-language writer of our century. Now for the first time in English, all of Borges' dazzling fictions are gathered into a single volume, brilliantly translated by Andrew Hurley. From his 1935 debut with The Universal History of Iniquity, through his immensely influential collections Ficciones and The Aleph, these enigmatic, elaborate, imaginative inventions display Borges' talent for turning fiction on its head by playing with form and genre and toying with language. Together these incomparable works comprise the perfect one-volume compendium for all those who have long loved Borges, and a superb introduction to the master's work for those who have yet to discover this singular genius.",

    "description": "One of Carlos Fuentes's greatest works, <i>The Old Gringo</i> tells the story of Ambrose Bierce, the American writer, soldier, and journalist, and of his last mysterious days in Mexico living among Pancho Villa's soldiers, particularly his encounter with General Tomas Arroyo. In the end, the incompatibility of the two countries (or, paradoxically, their intimacy) claims both men, in a novel that is, most of all, about the tragic history of two cultures in conflict.",

    "description": "Stoker, Bram \"Dracula\" in the revolutionary Bed Book Landscape Reading Format - a new approach to reading in bed as well as other places people enjoy reading while lying down, such as the beach, or on a grassy lawn in the park. Bed Books provide the freedom to lie in any comfortable position without being obligated to sit up in order to read. They can be an essential aid for readers who may be prone to back and neck strain when assuming the contorted body positions normally required for reading while lying down, and for those who have previously found it difficult or impossible to read books in bed, such as the elderly and the disabled. Bed Books can also be read sitting up as easily as with a conventional book.

During this war a great Avar chieftain, Hadji Mur\u00e1d, broke with the Chechen leader Shamil and fled to the Russians for safety. Months later, while attempting to rescue his family from Shamil\u2019s prison, Hadji Mur\u00e1d was pursued by those he had betrayed and, after fighting the most heroic battle of his life, was killed.<br /><br />Tolstoy, witness to many of the events leading to Hadji Mur\u00e1d\u2019s death, set down this story with painstaking accuracy to preserve for future generations the horror, nobility, and destruction inherent in war.",

    "description": "In her enthralling novels of literary suspense, Carol Goodman writes stories that resonate with emotion set in lush landscapes that entice the senses. Now, with The Ghost Orchid, a narrative that seamlessly weaves together the past and the present, Goodman creates her most lyrical and haunting work to date. <br /><br />For more than one hundred years, creative souls have traveled to Upstate New York to work under the captivating spell of the Bosco estate. Cradled in silence, inspired by the rough beauty of overgrown gardens and crumbling statuary, these chosen few fashion masterworks\u2013and have cemented Bosco\u2019s reputation as a premier artists\u2019 colony. This season, five talented artists-in-residence find themselves drawn to the history of Bosco, from the extensive network of fountains that were once its centerpiece but have long since run dry to the story of its enigmatic founder, Aurora Latham, and the series of tragic events that occurred more than a century ago.<br /><br />Ellis Brooks, a first-time novelist, has come to Bosco to write a book based on Aurora and the infamous summer of 1893, when wealthy, powerful Milo Latham brought the notorious medium Corinth Blackwell to the estate to help his wife contact three of the couple\u2019s children, lost the winter before in a diphtheria epidemic. But when a s\u00e9ance turned deadly, Corinth and her alleged accomplice, Tom Quinn, disappeared, taking with them the Lathams\u2019 only surviving child. <br /><br />The more time she spends at Bosco, the more Ellis becomes convinced that there is an even darker, more sinister end to the story. And she\u2019s not alone: biographer Bethesda Graham uncovers stunning revelations about Milo and Corinth; landscape architect David Fox discovers a series of hidden tunnels underneath the gardens; poet Zalman Bronsky hears the long-dry fountain\u2019s waters beckoning him; and novelist Nat Loomis feels something lingering just out of reach.<br /><br />After a bizarre series of accidents befalls them, the group cannot deny the connections between the long ago and now, the living and the dead . . . as Ellis realizes that the tangled truth may ensnare them all in its cool embrace.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

The resulting documentary earned him an Academy Award nomination and broke box-office records worldwide. But there's more to the story, and in <b>Don't Eat This Book</b>, Spurlock examines everything from school lunch programs and the marketing of fast food to the decline of physical education. He looks at why fast food is so tasty, cheap, and ultimately seductive--and interviews experts from surgeons general and kids to marketing gurus and lawmakers, who share their research and opinions on what we can do to offset a health crisis of supersized proportions.<br /><br />Don't eat this groundbreaking, hilarious book--but if you care about your country's health, your children's, and your own, you better read it.",

    "description": "All Christians are called. Called to love God with all that we are. Called to serve Him. Called to reach out to the lost. However, if we are honest, the majority of us would admit that we find this last calling the most difficult. While we gladly support the evangelistic ministries of others, many of us feel discouraged by our own attempts at witnessing because our memorized approaches don't seem to work.<br /><br />This biblical study of evangelism gracefully reminds us that the New Testament model of witnessing is not a one-size-fits-all methodology. With compassion for the lost filling every page, Jerram Barrs shows the variety of approaches used in the New Testament-where the same uncompromised Gospel was packaged as differently as the audience-and calls you to follow its example.<br /><br />You <strong>can</strong> learn to witness comfortably in your particular circumstances so that sharing Christ doesn't feel like a chore. And as you watch God work in the lives of others and see the great blessings He brings, you'll discover what a privilege it is to live out the heart of evangelism: truly loving others to Christ.",

    "description": "Is God a public figure? Does Christianity have a legitimate role to play in the public realm of politics, business, law, and education? Or are secularists right when they relegate religion to the strictly private realm of faith and feelings? <br /><br />In <em>Total Truth</em>, Nancy Pearcey offers a razor-sharp analysis of the split between public and private, fact and feelings. She reveals the strategies of secularist gatekeepers who use this division to banish biblical principles from the cultural mainstream, stripping Christianity of its power to challenge and redeem the whole of culture.<br /><br />How can we overcome this divide? Unify our fragmented lives? Recover authentic spirituality? With compelling examples from the struggles of real people, Pearcey shows how to liberate Christianity from its cultural captivity. She walks readers through practical, hands-on steps for developing a full-orbed Christian worldview. Finally, she makes a passionate case that Christianity is not just religious truth but truth about total reality.

    "description": "The dramatic autobiography of one of China's dedicated, courageous, and intensely persecuted house church leaders.<br /> This is the gripping story of how God took a young, half-starved boy from a poor village in Henan province and placed him on the front line for Jesus, in the face of impossible odds. Instead of focusing on the many miracles or experiences of suffering, however, Yun prefers to focus on the character and beauty of Jesus. Interspersed with his personal account are contributions from his wife, Deling, made mostly during her husband's frequent periods of imprisonment. You will remember where you were the first time you read this life story. It's a watershed book that will turn the reader to prayer and praise. It deserves comparison with past classics such as <i>Tortured for Christ</i> by Richard Wurmbrand, or the <i>Life of Watchman Nee</i>.",

    "description": "With an Introduction and Notes by Dr T.C.B.Cook <br /><br />Count Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) is best known for War and Peace and Anna Karenina, commonly regarded as amongst the greatest novels ever written. He also, however, wrote many masterly short stories, and this volume contains four of the longest and best in distinguished translations that have stood the test of time. In the early story 'Family Happiness', Tolstoy explores courtship and marriage from the point of view of a young wife. In 'The Kreutzer Sonata' he gives us a terrifying study of marital breakdown, in 'The Devil' a powerful depiction of the power of sexual temptation, and, in perhaps the finest of all, 'The Death of Ivan Ilyich', he portrays the long agony of a man gradually coming to terms with his own mortality.<br /><br /><i>Librarian's note: See alternate cover edition of ISBN 1840224533 <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18384.The_Death_of_Ivan_Ilyich_and_Other_Stories\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</i>",

Walsh and fully bilingual. <em>Residence on Earth</em> is perhaps Neruda's greatest work. Upon its publication in 1973, this bilingual publication instantly became \"a revolution... a classic by which masterpieces are judged\" (<em>Review</em>). \"In <em>Residence on Earth</em>,\" wrote Amado Alonso, \"the tornado of fury will no longer pass without lingering, because it will be identified with [Neruda's] heart.\"",

This book grounds students in both the theory of ethics and its application to today's pressing social issues.Avoiding undue dogmatism, Professor Scott B. Rae outlines the distinctive elements of Christian ethics. He also introduces students to various ethical systems and their key historical proponents, including Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, and Kant. And, after describing a seven-step procedure for tackling ethical dilemmas, he uses case studies to address the current issues listed below.Now in its second edition, Moral Choices is expanded and revised to provide the most current insights. Topics include: AbortionReproductive TechnologiesEuthanasia Capital PunishmentSexual EthicsThe Morality of WarThe Legislation of MoralityNew: Genetic Technologies and Human CloningBesides the new chapter, substantial changes have been made in the chapters on euthanasia and reproductive technologies.",

Now, having left her father behind in Chicago for dreams of art school and marriage to an ambitious young doctor, she finds herself with a child of her own.

Originally published in 1996 and later chosen by World magazine as one of the top 100 books of the twentieth century, Gilbert Meilaender's Bioethics covers a wide range of pressing bioethical issues and offers discerning guidance on how Christians ought to think about them.In admirably clear language Meilaender discusses abortion, assisted reproduction, genetic advance and prenatal screening, care for the dying and euthanasia, human experimentation, and more. This new edition of his Bioethics features updated information throughout, a fuller discussion of human embryos -- including stem cell research -- and a thorough rewrite of the chapter on organ donation.\"",

The inspiring story of Levi's liberation from the German death camp in January 1945 by the Red Army, it tells of his strange and eventful journey home to Italy by way of the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Romania. Levi's railway travels take him through bombed-out cities and transit camps, with keen insight he describes the former prisoners and Russian soldiers he encounters along the way. An extraordinary account of faith, hope, and undying courage, <i>The Reawakening</i> was praised by Irving Howe as \"a remarkable feat of literary craft.\"",

    "description": "Through a nationwide telephone survey of 2,000 people and an additional 200 face-to-face interviews, Michael O. Emerson and Christian Smith probed the grassroots of white evangelical America. They found that despite recent efforts by the movement's leaders to address the problem of racial discrimination, evangelicals themselves seem to be preserving America's racial chasm. In fact, most white evangelicals see no systematic discrimination against blacks. But the authors contend that it is not active racism that prevents evangelicals from recognizing ongoing problems in American society. Instead, it is the evangelical movement's emphasis on individualism, free will, and personal relationships that makes invisible the pervasive injustice that perpetuates racial inequality. Most racial problems, the subjects told the authors, can be solved by the repentance and conversion of the sinful individuals at fault.<br /> Combining a substantial body of evidence with sophisticated analysis and interpretation, the authors throw sharp light on the oldest American dilemma. In the end, they conclude that despite the best intentions of evangelical leaders and some positive trends, real racial reconciliation remains far over the horizon.<br />",

An enduring masterwork and \"one of the most neglected resources of our century\" (Adrienne Rich), <i>Waiting for God</i> will continue to influence spiritual and political thought for centuries to come.<br /><br />\"Simone Weil has become a legend, and her writings are regarded as a classic document of our period.\" <i>THE NEW YORKER</i><br /><br />\"Her example, her achievements, her frustrations, her intellectual or moral or religious impasses, and her failures, self-described or apparent to us from hindsight, all can serve to focus the mind, enlarge the heart, and stir the soul.\" ROBERT COLES",

    "description": "The magnificent Aztec empire has fallen beneath the brutal heal of the Spaniards. But one proud Aztec, Tenamaxtli, refuses to bow to his despised conquerors. He dreams of restoring the lost glory of the Aztec empire, and recruits an army of rebels to mount an insurrection against the seemingly invincible power of mighty Spain. <br />Tenamaxtli's courageous quest takes us through high adventure, passionate women, unlikely allies, bright hope, bitter tragedy, and the essence of 16th century Mexico. This incredible rebellion has been little remembered, perhaps because it shed no glory on the men who would write the history book, but on its outcome depended the future of all North America. <i>Aztec Autumn</i> recreates this forgotten chapter of history in all its splendor and unforgettable passion.",

    "description": "A 2001 Christianity Today Award of Merit winner! The concept of truth as absolute, objective and universal has undergone serious deterioration in recent years. No longer is it a goal for all to pursue. Rather postmodernism sees truth as inseparable from culture, psychology, race and gender. Ultimately, truth is what we make it to be. What factors have accelarated this decay of truth? Why are people willing to embrace such a devalued concept? How does this new view compare and contrast with a Christian understanding? While postmodernism contains some truthful insights (despite its attempt to dethrone truth), Douglas Groothuis sees its basic tenets as intellectually flawed and hostile to Christian views. In this spirited presentation of a solid, biblical and logical perspective, Groothuis unveils how truth has come under attack and how it can be defended in the vital areas of theology, apologetics, ethics and the arts.",

Il se souviendra de tout, racontera tout: la promiscuitedes blocks-dortoirs, les camarades qu'on y decouvre a l'aube, morts de froid et defaim; les humiliations et le travail quotidiens, sous les coups de trique des kapos;les selections periodiques ou l'on separe les malades des bien-portants pourles envoyer a la mort; les pendaisons pour l'exemple; les trains, bourres de juifset de tziganes, qu'on dirige des leur arrivee vers les crematoires...Et pourtant, dans ce recit, la dignite la plus impressionnante; aucune haine, aucunexces, aucune exploitation des souffrances personnelles, mais une reflexionmorale sur la douleur, sublimee en une vision de la vie.<br /><strong>Paru en 1946, <em>Si c'est un homme</em> est considere comme un des livres les plus</strong><strong>importants du XXe siecle</strong>.<br /><br />Parce qu'il est familier des grands textes philosophiques, Raphael Enthoven resout avec une talentueuse sobriete la difficile equation que pose le texte de Primo Levi: comment nommer l'innommable ?<br />Remerciements a Benoit Peeters, ecrivain, pour sa lecture de l'interview de Primo Levi par Philippe Roth.<br /><br />Avec le soutien de la Fondation pour la Memoire de la Shoah",

    "description": "Reformation is the continual reforming of the mission of the church to enhance God\u2019s command to reach out to others in a way that acknowledges the unique times and locations of daily life. This engaging book blends the integrity of respected theoreticians with the witty and practical insights of a pastor. It calls for a movement of missionaries to seek the lost across the street as well as across the globe. This basic primer on the interface between gospel and culture highlights the contrast between presentation evangelism and participation evangelism. It helps Christians navigate between the twin pitfalls of syncretism (being so culturally irrelevant that you lose your message) and sectarianism (being so culturally irrelevant that you lose your mission). Included are interviews with those who have crossed cultural barriers, such as a television producer, exotic dancer, tattoo studio owner, and band manager. The appendix represents eight portals into the future: population, family, health/medicine, creating, learning, sexuality, and religion. Mark Driscoll was recently featured on the ABC special The Changing of Worship.",

    "description": "This is the story of the birth and growth of Seattle\u2019s innovative Mars Hill Church, one of America\u2019s fastest growing churches located in one of America\u2019s toughest mission fields. It\u2019s also the story of the growth of a pastor, the mistakes he\u2019s made along the way, and God\u2019s grace and work in spite of those mistakes. Mark Driscoll\u2019s emerging, missional church took a rocky road from its start in a hot, upstairs youth room with gold shag carpet to its current weekly attendance of thousands. With engaging humor, humility, and candor, Driscoll shares the failures, frustrations, and just plain messiness of trying to build a church that is faithful to the gospel of Christ in a highly post-Christian culture. In the telling, he\u2019s not afraid to skewer some sacred cows of traditional, contemporary, and emerging churches. Each chapter discusses not only the hard lessons learned but also the principles and practices that worked and that can inform your church\u2019s ministry, no matter its present size. The book includes discussion questions and appendix resources. \u201cAfter reading a book like this, you can never go back to being an inwardly focused church without a mission. Even if you disagree with Mark about some of the things he says, you cannot help but be convicted to the inner core about what it means to have a heart for those who don\u2019t know Jesus.\u201d\u2014Dan Kimball, author,The Emerging Church \u201c\u2026 will make you laugh, cry, and get mad \u2026 school you, shape you, and mold you into the right kind of priorities to lead the church in today\u2019s messy world.\u201d\u2014Robert Webber, Northern Seminary",

The story explores the complex, multi-layered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion as the forces of the empire confront each other for control of Arrakis.<br /><br />Published in 1965, it won the Hugo Award in 1966 and the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel. Dune is frequently cited as the world's best-selling sf novel.",

    "description": "The international best-seller that makes mathematics a thrilling exploration.<br /><br />In twelve dreams, Robert, a boy who hates math, meets a Number Devil, who leads him to discover the amazing world of numbers: infinite numbers, prime numbers, Fibonacci numbers, numbers that magically appear in triangles, and numbers that expand without. As we dream with him, we are taken further and further into mathematical theory, where ideas eventually take flight, until everyone - from those who fumble over fractions to those who solve complex equations in their heads - winds up marveling at what numbers can do.<br /><br />Hans Magnus Enzensberger is a true polymath, the kind of superb intellectual who loves thinking and marshals all of his charm and wit to share his passions with the world. In <i>The Number Devil</i>, he brings together the surreal logic of Alice in Wonderland and the existential geometry of Flatland with the kind of math everyone would love, if only they had a number devil to teach it to them.",

    "description": "While the <i>Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece</i> is designed for scholarly research, the <i>Greek New Testament, 4th Revised Edition</i> is designed for translators and students.<p> Like NA27, this is the leading edition of the original text of the New Testament. It contains the same Greek text as NA27, differing only in some details of punctuation and paragraphing. The format of UBS4 is in several respects more user-friendly for students and translators than NA27. It has a more spacious appearance and a larger font. English sub-headings assist in navigating the text for those who may be less familiar with Greek. Old Testament quotations appear in easily recognizable bold font. Synoptic parallels are clearly listed under English headings.</p><p> The critical apparatus includes exegetically significant variants (fewer than NA27) but adds extensive manuscript evidence (more than NA27) for each variant, thereby offering in-depth instruction for students on how variants and the evidence for them work together.</p><p> An introduction in English is included.</p>",

    "description": "In the bizarre world of Franz Kafka, salesmen turn into giant bugs, apes give lectures at college academies, and nightmares probe the mysteries of modern humanity\u2019s unhappiness. More than any other modern writer in world literature, Kafka captures the loneliness and misery that fill the lives of 20th-century humanity. The Metamorphosis and Other Stories reveals the author\u2019s extraordinary talent in a variety of forms\u2014prose poems, short stories, sketches, allegories, and novelettes\u2014and showcases the straight\u2013faced humor, startling psychological insight, and haunting imagination for which he is revered as a modern master. In this brilliant new translation, prize\u2013winning translator Joachim Neugroschel preserves the delicate balance, rich timbre, and wondrous language of Kafka\u2019s original works. In addition to \"The Metamorphosis\", this collection includes \"Early Stories\", \"Contemplation\", \"The Judgement\", \"The Stoker\", \"In the Penal Colony\", and \"A Country Doctor\".",

    "description": "A light-skinned beauty who spends years passing for white finds herself dangerously drawn to an old friend's Harlem neighborhood. A restless young mulatto tries desperately to find a comfortable place in a world in which she sees herself as a perpetual outsider. A mother's confrontation with tragedy tests her loyalty to her race.<br /><br />The gifted Harlem Renaissance writer Nella Larsen wrote compelling dramas about the black middle class that featured sensitive, spirited heroines struggling to find a place where they belonged. <i>Passing</i>, Larsen's best-known work, is a disturbing story about the unraveling lives of two childhood friends, one of whom turns her back on her past and marries a white bigot. Just as disquieting is the portrait in <i>Quicksand</i> of Helga Crane, half black and half white, who can't escape her loneliness no matter where and with whom she lives. Race and marriage offer few securities her or in the other stories in a collection that is compellingly readable, rich in psychological complexity, and imbued with a sense of place that brings Harlem vibrantly to life.",

    "description": "La obra de Juan Rulfo (1917\u20131986) es sin duda la creaci\u00f3n literaria mexicana que ha recibido mayor reconocimiento dentro y fuera de su pa\u00eds. La novela Pedro P\u00e1ramo tuvo una larga gestaci\u00f3n. Rulfo la menciona por primera vez en una carta de 1947, y puede trabajar en ella hasta terminarla entre 1953 y 1954, gracias a una beca del Centro Mexicano de Escritores. En 1954 publica adelantos de la misma en tres revistas y en 1955 aparece como libro. Entre los admiradores de esta obra maestra, habiendo escrito tambi\u00e9n sobre ella, figuran Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Jorge Luis Borges y Susan Sontag. Pedro P\u00e1ramo recoge lo m\u00e1s profundo de M\u00e9xico y las formas y t\u00e9cnicas literarias m\u00e1s avanzadas de su siglo. Pocas obras tocan al lector mexicano como \u00e9sta, considerada tambi\u00e9n un cl\u00e1sico de la literatura universal. Sus traducciones se acercan al medio centenar y cada a\u00f1o aparecen nuevas versiones. (Texto definitivo de la obra establecido por la Fundaci\u00f3n Juan Rulfo)",

Most people who are ensnared by the bait of Satan don't even realize it. Don't be fooled! You will encounter offense, and it's up to you how it will affect your relationship with God. Your response will determine your future. If offense is handled correctly, you will become stronger rather than bitter.<br /><br />In this tenth anniversary edition of his best-selling book, John Bevere shows you how to stay free from offense and escape the victim mentality. With more than 400,000 copies in print, this book includes testimonials of transformed people who have read copies in print, this book includes testimonials of transformed people who have read the original book and a devotional supplement, featuring discussion questions, scriptures, and prayers.<br /><br /><b>You will find answers to tough questions like these:</b><br /><br /><br />Why am I compelled to tell \"my side\" of the story? How can I fight thoughts of suspicion or distrust? What can I do to stop rehearsing past hurts? How can I regain trust after someone deeply offends me?<br />This book will help you escape the enemy's \"offensive trap\" as well as empower you to stay free of offense, enabling you to have an unhindered relationship with God.<br /><b>\n  <br /></b><br />",

    "description": "Take a look at Americans in their natural habitat: guys shopping for barbecue grills, doing that special walk men do when in the presence of lumber; superefficient soccer Ubermoms who chair school auctions, organize PTAs, and weigh less than their kids; and suburban chain restaurants, which if they merged would be called Chili's Olive Garden Hard Rock Outback Cantina. Are we as shallow as we look? Many around the world see us as the great bimbos. Sure, Americans work hard and are energetic, but that is because we are money-hungry and don't know how to relax. <br /> But if you probe deeper, you find that we behave the way we do because we live under the spell of paradise. We are the inheritors of a sense of limitless possibilities, raised to think in the future tense and to strive toward the happiness we naturally accept. <br /><i>On Paradise Drive,</i> at once serious and comic, describes this distinct American future-mindedness that shapes our personalities and underlies our beliefs.",

George Saunders tells the story of a father who takes caution to dangerous extremes in \"Lars Farf, Excessively Fearful Father and Husband.\" In \"ACES by Phone,\" a small boy finds a cell phone that lets him listen in on the thoughts of dogs, and in \"Small Country,\" Nick Hornby introduces a country too small for a postal system but, unfortunately for one bookish boy, just big enough for a football team. Each story features full-color illustrations by artists including Barry Blitt, Lane Smith, David Heatley, and Marcel Dzama.<br /><br />The collection includes previously unpublished children's stories from Jonathan Safran Foer (<i>Everything is Illuminated</i>), Nick Hornby (<i>High Fidelity</i>), Neil Gaiman (<i>Sandman</i>), George Saunders (<i>CivilWarLand in Bad Decline</i>), Kelly Link (<i>Stranger Than Fiction</i>), and Jon Scieskza (<i>Stinky Cheese Man</i>). The dust jacket folds into a unique aerogram, which factors into a special contest involving a story written partly by Lemony Snicket, partly by thousands of children.",

    "description": "Knitting is hot, with 4 million newcomers in the last few years joining a core group of 38,000,000 knitters nationwide. And these are primarily young, creative, connected chicks with sticks who are coming together in living rooms, knitting cafes, and chic yarn stores, and making everything from funky hats to bikinis.<br /><br />In <i>Stitch 'n Bitch</i>, Debbie Stoller-founder of the first Stitch 'n Bitch knitting group in New York City-covers every aspect of knitting and the knitting-together lifestyle: the how-to, the when-to, the what-to, the why-to. Writing with wit and attitude (<i>The Knitty-Gritty, Blocking for Blockheads</i>), she explains the different types of needles and yarns (and sheep, too) and all the techniques from basic to fancy, knit to purl to cast-off. She also shares her special brand of corrective surgery for when things go wrong, and offers fun and informative sidebars on such topics as how to find the best yarn for less, how to make a buttonhole, knitting etiquette, and what tools to keep in your knitting bag. At the heart of the book are forty stylish patterns: Alien Scarf, Big Bad Baby Blanky, Mohair Hoodie, Kitty and Devil Hat, Cell Phone Cozy, and Wonder Woman Bikini. And for anyone interested: how to start a Stitch 'n Bitch group.",

    "description": "On a snowy Thanksgiving day in North Carolina along a stretch of rural highway, a dreamy eight-year-old named Danny Crell is caught in the middle of a violent quarrel between his parents. Danny's father, Bobjay Crell, has been at the mercy of doctors, unforgiving landlords, and cruel farm bosses ever since he lost an arm in a farm accident. His subsequent fits of rage and drunken jealousy have taken their toll on his wife and five children. The two hemophiliac boys, Danny and his younger brother Grove, have been particularly vulnerable. Bobjay isn't the same man that young Ellen Crell married years ago, but still she will go to terrible lengths to keep him home and sober and, failing that, to just hold the family together. In the midst of the worst violence, Ellen becomes a stranger to the children, as frightening in her own way as Bobjay in his worst rages. In a ramshackle cottage the children name \"The Circle House\" for its circle of rooms where one door opens on to the next in a dizzy escape leading nowhere, Ellen and the children must face at last the tormented man who terrorizes them all. Jim Grimsley's brilliant first novel unfolds in a strikingly unconventional way - as Danny tells himself his own story - and brings to light a shattering story of heartbreak, violence, and the endurance of the spirit.",

    "description": "<b>Part of the Jewish Encounter series<br /></b><br />In 1656, Amsterdam\u2019s Jewish community excommunicated Baruch Spinoza, and, at the age of twenty\u2013three, he became the most famous heretic in Judaism. He was already germinating a secularist challenge to religion that would be as radical as it was original. He went on to produce one of the most ambitious systems in the history of Western philosophy, so ahead of its time that scientists today, from string theorists to neurobiologists, count themselves among Spinoza\u2019s progeny.<br /><br />In <i>Betraying Spinoza,</i> Rebecca Goldstein sets out to rediscover the flesh-and-blood man often hidden beneath the veneer of rigorous rationality, and to crack the mystery of the breach between the philosopher and his Jewish past. Goldstein argues that the trauma of the Inquisition\u2019 s persecution of its forced Jewish converts plays itself out in Spinoza\u2019s philosophy. The excommunicated Spinoza, no less than his excommunicators, was responding to Europe\u2019 s first experiment with racial anti-Semitism.<br /><br />Here is a Spinoza both hauntingly emblematic and deeply human, both heretic and hero\u2014a surprisingly contemporary figure ripe for our own uncertain age.",

    "description": "In <i>Summerland</i>, his first novel for young readers, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon attempts an American Narnia. Inspired by Lewis and Tolkien, he's created his own magical landscape on which to paint a sweeping fantasy quest, but mixes the same ingredients--folklore and new inventions--in a distinctively American way. <p> The plot is simple and pure, but takes a long time to tell. The setting is Clam Island, Washington, specifically the area on the western tip of the island known as the Summerlands, which enjoys zero rainfall and yearlong fine weather. Ethan Feld, a self-described really bad ball player, is recruited by a 100-year-old scout called Mr. Chiron \"Ringfinger\" Brown. Ethan is needed to help the ferishers, essentially fairies, to save their world from eradication. On the great infinite tree of worlds, Summerland is on the boundary between two such worlds, and a particularly destructive fairy called Coyote and his band of warriors are nearby and threatening to destroy everything. </p><p> Heroes are desperately needed to counter this threat, and their journey involves a lot of baseball, but also encounters with giants, bat-winged goblins, sea monsters, and assorted cunning magic. The novel features an ensemble cast of equal parts that shine and fade in turn, and yet the undoubtedly fine writing fails to mask the enormity and complexities of the world in which they travel, and the bad guys getting their comeuppance always seems so far away. Readers need to savor every word in <i>Summerland</i> to extract the best flavors from it. (Ages 10 and older.) <i>--John McLay, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>",

Only half of her wish comes true.<br /> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It turns out the coin grants wishes\u2014but only by half, so that you must wish for twice as much as you want.<br /> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wishing for two times some things is a cinch, but other doubled wishes only cause twice as much trouble. What is half of twice a talking cat? Or to be half-again twice not-here? And how do you double your most heartfelt wish, the one you care about so much it has to be perfect?",

Two young women besieged by the demands of mothers, lovers, and careers\u2014not to mention a highly persistent telephone answering machine\u2014as they struggle to have it all. A brilliant feminist art historian trying to keep her bearings and her sense of humor on the elevator ride from the radical sixties to the heartless eighties.<br /><br />Wendy Wasserstein's characters are so funny, so many-sided, and so <i>real</i> that we seem to know them from their Scene One entrances, though the places they go are invariably surprising. And these three plays\u2014<i>Uncommon Women and Others</i>, <i>Isn't It Romantic</i>, and the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>The Heidi</i> <i>Chronicles</i>\u2014manage to engage us heart, mind, and soul on such a deep and lasting level that they are already recognized as classics of the modern theater.",

    "description": "In this gritty, confessional memoir, Michelle Tea takes the reader back to the city of her childhood: Chelsea, Massachusetts\u2014a place where time and hope are spent on things not getting any worse. Tea\u2019s girlhood is shaped by the rough fabric of the neighborhood and by its characters\u2014the soft vulnerability of her sister Madeline and her quietly brutal Polish father; the doddering, sometimes violent nuns of Our Lady of Assumption; Marisol Lewis from the projects by the creek; and Johnna Latrotta, the tough-as-nails Italian dance-school teacher who offered a slim chance for escape to every young Chelsea girl in tulle and tap shoes. Told in Tea\u2019s trademark loose-tongued, lyrical style, this memoir both celebrates and annihilates one girl\u2019s tightrope walk out of a working-class slum and the lessons she carries with her. With wry humor and a hard-fought wisdom, Tea limns the extravagant peril of a dramatic adolescence with the private, catastrophic secret harbored within the walls of her family\u2019s home\u2014a secret that threatens to destroy her family forever.",

    "description": "Philippe Bourgois's ethnographic study of social marginalization in inner-city America, won critical acclaim when it was first published in 1995. For the first time, an anthropologist had managed to gain the trust and long-term friendship of street-level drug dealers in one of the roughest ghetto neighborhoods--East Harlem. This new edition adds a prologue describing the major dynamics that have altered life on the streets of East Harlem in the seven years since the first edition. In a new epilogue Bourgois brings up to date the stories of the people--Primo, Caesat, Luis, Tony, Candy--who readers come to know in this remarkable window onto the world of the inner city drug trade. Philippe Bourgois is Professor and Chair of the Department of Anthropology, History and Social Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. He has conducted fieldwork in Central America on ethnicity and social unrest and is the author of Ethnicity at Work: Divided Labor on a Central American Banana Plantation (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989). He is writing a book on homeless heroin addicts in San Francisco. 1/e hb ISBN (1996) 0-521-43518-8 1/e pb ISBN (1996) 0-521-57460-9",

    "description": "<b>A <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Favorite Book of the Year</b><br /><br />In 1746, Samuel Johnson undertook the Herculean task of writing the first comprehensive English dictionary. Imagining he could complete the job in three years, Johnson in fact took more than eight, and the dictionary itself turned out to be as much a work of literature as it was an invaluable reference. In alphabetized chapters, from \"Adventurous\" to \"Zootomy,\" Henry Hitchings tells of Johnson's toil and triumph and offers a closer look at the definitions themselves, which were alive with invention, poetry, erudition, and, at times, hilarious imprecision. The story of Johnson's adventure into the essence of words is an entertainment that \"sparkles on every page\" (<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>).",

    "description": "First published in 1946, <em>History of Western Philosophy</em> went on to become the best-selling philosophy book of the twentieth century. A dazzlingly ambitious project, it remains unchallenged to this day as the ultimate introduction to Western philosophy. Providing a sophisticated overview of the ideas that have perplexed people from time immemorial, it is 'long on wit, intelligence and curmudgeonly scepticism', as the <em>New York Times</em> noted, and it is this, coupled with the sheer brilliance of its scholarship, that has made Russell's <em>History of Western Philosophy</em> one of the most important philosophical works of all time.",

This sexy, epic, hilarious, poignant and romantic sequel to \"Pride and Prejudice\" is not for Jane Austen purists.

    "description": "One of the most respected artists in popular music today, Jewel is much more than a music industry success with her debut album selling more than 10 million copies.<br /><br />Before her gifted songwriting comes an even more individual art: Poetry.<br /><br />Now available in paperback, <em>A Night without Armor</em> highlights the poetry of Jewel taken from her journals which are both intimate and inspiring, to be embraced and enjoyed.<br /><br />Writing poems and keeping journals since childhood, Jewel has been searching for truth and meaning, turning to her words to record, to discover, and to reflect.<br /><br />In <em>A Night Without Armor,</em> her first collection of poetry, Jewel explores the fire of first love, the lessons of betrayal, and the healing of intimacy. She delves into matters of the home, the comfort of family, the beauty of Alaska, and the dislocation of divorce.<br /><br />Frank and honest, serious and suddenly playful, <em>A Night Without Armor</em> is a talented artist's intimate portrait of what makes us uniquely human.",

Written in the shadow of the rise of fascism\u00a0during the 1930s, <em>Brave New World</em>\u00a0likewise speaks to a 21st-century world dominated by mass-entertainment, technology, medicine and\u00a0pharmaceuticals, the arts of persuasion, and the hidden influence of elites.\u00a0<br /><br />\"Aldous Huxley is the greatest 20th century writer in English.\" \u2014C<em>hicago Tribune</em><br /><br />",

Ten years have passed; the impulsive former athlete has become a paunchy thirty-six-year-old conservative, and Eisenhower\u2019s becalmed America has become 1969\u2019s lurid turmoil of technology, fantasy, drugs, and violence. Rabbit is abandoned by his family, his home invaded by a runaway and a radical, his past reduced to a ruined inner landscape; still he clings to semblances of decency and responsibility, and yearns to belong and to believe.",

    "description": "In Thatcher's Britain, barely out of his teens, highly intelligent but illiterate and with a childhood of care homes and fostering behind him, Simon Austen is sent down for life for murdering his girlfriend. He did it but he doesn't know why - or maybe doesn't want to know why. Or both ...Then Simon makes an important decision to rehabilitate himself on his own terms. He learns to read and write; then, daringly, from his high security prison, begins an illicit correspondence with members of the opposite sex. Language suddenly takes on a new significance and the world opens up. But what kind of relationships are possible for a man who has committed an appalling crime? As Simon puts it: What will she be like? And who will I become? Through Simon's journey into himself, his search for answers, sometimes perilous and always unpredictable, we are forced to explore both our understanding of identity and our ambivalent attitudes to crime, justice and the possibility of redemption.",

    "description": "Creativity, new ideas, innovation -- in any age they are keys to success, but in today's whirlwind economy they are essential for survival itself. Yet, as Robert Sutton explains, the standard rules of business behavior and management are precisely the opposite of what it takes to build an innovative company. We are told to hire people who will fit in; to train them extensively; and to work to instill a corporate culture in every employee. In fact, in order to foster creativity, we should hire misfits, goad them to fight, and pay them to defy convention and undermine the prevailing culture. <i>Weird Ideas That Work</i> codifies these and other proven counterintuitive ideas to help you turn your workplace from staid and safe to wild and woolly -- and creative. <br /> Stanford professor Robert Sutton is an authority on innovation and a popular speaker. In <i>Weird Ideas That Work</i> he draws on extensive research in behavioral psychology to explain how innovation can be fostered in hiring, managing, and motivating people; building teams; making decisions; and interacting with outsiders. Business practices like \"hire people who make you uncomfortable,\" \"reward success and failure, but punish inaction,\" and \"decide to do something that will probably fail, and then convince yourself and everyone else that success is certain\" strike many managers as strange or even downright wrong. Yet <i>Weird Ideas That Work</i> shows how some of the best teams and companies use these and other counterintuitive practices to crank out new ideas, and it demonstrates that every company can reap sales and profits from such creativity. <br /><i>Weird Ideas That Work</i> is filled with examples of each of Sutton's 11 1/2 practices, drawn from hi- and low-tech industries, manufacturing and services, information and products. More than just a set of bizarre suggestions, it represents a breakthrough in management thinking: Sutton shows that the practices we need to sustain performance are in constant tension with those that foster new ideas. The trick is to choose the right balance between conventional and \"weird\" -- and now, thanks to Robert Sutton's work, we have the tools we need to do so.",

    "description": "\u201cI lost my own father at 12 yr. of age and know what it is to be raised on lies and silences my dear daughter you are presently too young to understand a word I write but this history is for you and will contain no single lie may I burn in Hell if I speak false.\u201d<br /><br />In <b>True History of the Kelly Gang</b><i>,</i> the legendary Ned Kelly speaks for himself, scribbling his narrative on errant scraps of paper in semiliterate but magically descriptive prose as he flees from the police. To his pursuers, Kelly is nothing but a monstrous criminal, a thief and a murderer. To his own people, the lowly class of ordinary Australians, the bushranger is a hero, defying the authority of the English to direct their lives. Indentured by his bootlegger mother to a famous horse thief (who was also her lover), Ned saw his first prison cell at 15 and by the age of 26 had become the most wanted man in the wild colony of Victoria, taking over whole towns and defying the law until he was finally captured and hanged. Here is a classic outlaw tale, made alive by the skill of a great novelist.<i>\n  <br /></i>",

    "description": "<b>EXPERIENCE THE LIFELONG PLEASURES OF KNOWING GOD.</b> <br /><br />Satisfaction\u2026Happiness\u2026Joy. According to John Piper, the pursuit of pleasure in God is not only permissible, it\u2019s <i>essential</i>.<br /><br /><i>Desiring God</i> is a paradigm-shattering work that dramatically alters common perspectives on relating to God. \u00a0Piper reveals that there really is no need to choose between duty and delight in the Christian life. In fact, for the follower of Jesus, delight is the duty as Christ is most magnified in His people when they are most satisfied in Him.<br /><br />Constantly drawing on Scripture to build his case, Piper shows why pursuing maximum joy is essential to glorifying God. He discusses the implications of this for conversion, worship, love, Scripture, prayer, money, marriage, missions, and suffering.<br /><br />Piper beckons us to approach God with the hedonist\u2019s abandon. Finally, we are freed to enjoy Jesus\u2014not only as our Lord and Savior, but also as our all-surpassing, soul-satisfying Treasure.<br /><br /><i>Desiring God</i> may turn your Christian world upside down. And that will be a good thing, for the glory of God, and for your deepest joy.<br /><br /><br /><i>Includes study guide for individual and small group use.<br /><br /></i><br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",

From the very first attempts by the Greeks to grapple with the complexities of our known world to the latest application of infinity in physics, <i>The Road to Reality</i> carefully explores the movement of the smallest atomic particles and reaches into the vastness of intergalactic space. Here, Penrose examines the mathematical foundations of the physical universe, exposing the underlying beauty of physics and giving us one the most important works in modern science writing.",

    "description": "A novel of serendipity, of fortunes won and lost, and of the spectre of imprisonment that hangs over all aspects of Victorian society, Charles Dickens's <i>Little Dorrit</i> is edited with an introduction by Stephen Wall in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />When Arthur Clennam returns to England after many years abroad, he takes a kindly interest in Amy Dorrit, his mother's seamstress, and in the affairs of Amy's father, William Dorrit, a man of shabby grandeur, long imprisoned for debt in Marshalsea prison. As Arthur soon discovers, the dark shadow of the prison stretches far beyond its walls to affect the lives of many, from the kindly Mr Panks, the reluctant rent-collector of Bleeding Heart Yard, and the tipsily garrulous Flora Finching, to Merdle, an unscrupulous financier, and the bureaucratic Barnacles in the Circumlocution Office. A masterly evocation of the state and psychology of imprisonment, <i>Little Dorrit</i> is one of the supreme works of Dickens's maturity.<br /><br />Stephen Wall's introduction examines Dickens's transformation of childhood memories of his father's incarceration in the Marshalsea debtors' prison. This revised edition includes expanded notes, appendices and suggestion for further reading by Helen Small, a chronology of Dickens's life and works, and original illustrations.<br /><br />Charles Dickens is one of the best-loved novelists in the English language, whose 200th anniversary was celebrated in 2012. His most famous books, including <i>Oliver Twist</i>, <i>Great Expectations</i>, <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, <i>David Copperfield</i> and <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>, have been adapted for stage and screen and read by millions.<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>Little Dorrit</i>, you might like Dickens's <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>, also available in Penguin Classics.",

Because it is the one thing that doesn\u2019t change in changing times. <br />\u00a0<br />As the young boy becomes a man, he grows disillusioned with his work and his life.\u00a0 So he returns to ask the old man to help him find The Present. The old man responds, \u201cOnly you have the power to find The Present for yourself.\u201d Heeding the old man\u2019s advice, the young man embarks on a worldwide search for this magical gift that remains unchanging in a changing world, and holds the secret to personal happiness and lifelong success.<br />\u00a0<br />It is only after the young man has searched high and low and all but given up his relentless pursuit that he discovers The Present\u2014and all of the promises it offers.<br />\u00a0<br />Like the young man, you may find that it is the best gift you can ever give to yourself \u2014 and to those you care about.",

Exploring the prison cell as he counts down his final days, Cincinnatus cannot even find out when the moment of his execution will occur, and is troubled by the lack of control a condemned man has over his own life. Witty, satirical and nightmarish, Invitation to a Beheading creates a dystopian and fantastical world of political punishment, identity and the unusual hope of a man may carry to his death.",

    "description": "#1 bestselling author Jimmy Buffett is back at last with his first new novel in a decade!<br /><br />It's not on any chart, but the tropical island of Cayo Loco is the perfect place to run away from all your problems. If you're looking for a license to chill, come along as cowboy Tully Mars takes his pony to the shore-on an unforgettable Caribbean adventure as colorful and wonderfully bizarre as cocktail hour at your favorite expatriate bar.<p><br />From a lovely sunset sail in Punta Margarita to a wild spring-break foam party in San Pedro, Tully encounters an assortment of treasure hunters, rock stars, sailors, seaplane pilots, pirates, and even a ghost or two.</p><p><br />Waking from a ganja buzz on the beach in Tulum, Tully can't believe his eyes when a 142-foot schooner emerges out of the ocean mist. At its helm is Cleopatra Highbourne, the eccentric 102-year-old sea captain who will take him to a lighthouse on a salty piece of land that will change his life forever.</p><p><br />Once again, master storyteller Jimmy Buffett weaves a mesmerizing tale that combines both humor and emotional reflection. After all, one man's cathedral is another man's fishing hole. And in Jimmy Buffett's world, paradise is just a state of mind.</p>",

    "description": "When scholars write the history of the world twenty years from now, and they come to the chapter \"Y2K to March 2004,\" what will they say was the most crucial development? The attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11 and the Iraq war? Or the convergence of technology and events that allowed India, China, and so many other countries to become part of the global supply chain for services and manufacturing, creating an explosion of wealth in the middle classes of the world's two biggest nations, giving them a huge new stake in the success of globalization? And with this \"flattening\" of the globe, which requires us to run faster in order to stay in place, has the world gotten too small and too fast for human beings and their political systems to adjust in a stable manner? <br />In this brilliant new book, the award-winning \"New York Times\" columnist Thomas Friedman demystifies the brave new world for readers, allowing them to make sense of the often bewildering global scene unfolding before their eyes. With his inimitable ability to translate complex foreign policy and economic issues, Friedman explains how the flattening of the world happened at the dawn of the twenty-first century; what it means to countries, companies, communities, and individuals; and how governments and societies can, and must, adapt. \"The World Is Flat\" is the timely and essential update on globalization, its successes and discontents, powerfully illuminated by one of our most respected journalists.<br />",

    "description": "In an unnamed South American country, a world-renowned soprano sings at a birthday party in honor of a visiting Japanese industrial titan. His hosts hope that Mr. Hosokawa can be persuaded to build a factory in their Third World backwater. Alas, in the opening sequence, just as the accompanist kisses the soprano, a ragtag band of 18 terrorists enters the vice-presidential mansion through the air conditioning ducts. Their quarry is the president, who has unfortunately stayed home to watch a favorite soap opera. And thus, from the beginning, things go awry.<p> Among the hostages are not only Hosokawa and Roxane Coss, the American soprano, but an assortment of Russian, Italian, and French diplomatic types. Reuben Iglesias, the diminutive and gracious vice president, quickly gets sideways of the kidnappers, who have no interest in him whatsoever. Meanwhile, a Swiss Red Cross negotiator named Joachim Messner is roped into service while vacationing. He comes and goes, wrangling over terms and demands, and the days stretch into weeks, the weeks into months.</p><p> With the omniscience of magic realism, Ann Patchett flits in and out of the hearts and psyches of hostage and terrorist alike, and in doing so reveals a profound, shared humanity. Her voice is suitably lyrical, melodic, full of warmth and compassion. Hearing opera sung live for the first time, a young priest reflects: </p><blockquote> Never had he thought, never once, that such a woman existed, one who stood so close to God that God's own voice poured from her. How far she must have gone inside herself to call up that voice. It was as if the voice came from the center part of the earth and by the sheer effort and diligence of her will she had pulled it up through the dirt and rock and through the floorboards of the house, up into her feet, where it pulled through her, reaching, lifting, warmed by her, and then out of the white lily of her throat and straight to God in heaven. </blockquote> Joined by no common language except music, the 58 international hostages and their captors forge unexpected bonds. Time stands still, priorities rearrange themselves. Ultimately, of course, something has to give, even in a novel so imbued with the rich imaginative potential of magic realism. But in a fractious world, <i>Bel Canto</i> remains a gentle reminder of the transcendence of beauty and love. <i>--Victoria Jenkins</i>",

    "description": "It seems that the legendary composer Franz Schubert is alive\u2014well, sort of\u2014in the twenty-first century: His soul has taken up residence in the body of Brooklyn lawyer Liza Durbin. Even more astonishing, so has his prodigious gift. A mediocre pianist at best as a child, Liza can suddenly pound out concertos and compose masterly music out of the blue. But how can a brilliant male Austrian composer from the nineteenth century coexist in the everyday life of a modern American woman? And how can Liza explain what\u2019s happened to her without everyone thinking she\u2019s gone off the deep end? <br /><br />Fortunately, the evidence is tangible, and Liza is soon brought into the esteemed halls of Juilliard under the tutelage of the revered\u2014and feared\u2014Greta Pretsky, a humorless woman whose only interest in Liza is her channeling of Schubert. Greta\u2019s greedy for her next big star, and the entire New York City press is whispering of Liza\u2019s brilliance as the public awaits her debut at Carnegie Hall. Even Liza\u2019s boyfriend, Patrick, seems more in love with her than ever.<br /><br />Yet as Liza yields to Franz\u2019s great passion, her own life and identity threaten to elude her. Why was she chosen as the vessel for this musical genius\u2014and when, if ever, will he leave? Their entwined souls follow a path of ecstasy, peril, and surprise as they search for the final, liberating truth.<br /><br />A strikingly original novel, <b>Sleeping with Schuber</b><i>t</i> plays on years of speculation regarding Franz Schubert\u2019s \u201c<i>Unfinished Symphony</i>.\u201d Bonnie Marson\u2019s extraordinary imagination supposes that Schubert cannot truly die until the mystery is solved\u2014even if it means being resurrected in the body of a deceptively ordinary woman. Filled with drama and humor, this irresistible novel explores love, genius, and identity in ways that will engage and amaze readers.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "Who is your teenager listening to? Teenagers today are bombarded by messages from their peers, the Internet, music, movies . . . the list goes on. As parents, you may wonder if your words mean anything at all. If so, take heart: all research indicates that the most significant influence on the life of a teenager comes from his or her parents. Yes--parents! In this updated volume, marriage and family expert Dr. Gary Chapman lays out the tools you need to communicate with your teenager. As Dr. Chapman states, \"At the root of much teenage misbehavior is a teen's empty love tank. I am not suggesting that parents do not love their teenagers; I am suggesting that thousands of teenagers do not feel that love. For most parents, it is not a matter of sincerity but rather lack of information on how to communicate love effectively on an emotional level.\" Starting with the world in which your teenager lives, Dr. Chapman walks through the emotional needs of teenagers and how you can best express your love to them. You'll learn how to identify your teenager's love language, how to address their unique need for independence and responsibility, how to combat anger and set up boundaries, and how to best parent your teenager if you are a single parent or a blended family.",

    "description": "<br />One of the most famous psychological studies of the late twentieth century, <i>On Death and Dying</i> grew out of an interdisciplinary seminar on death, originated and conducted by Dr. Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross. In <i>On Death and Dying,</i> Dr. K\u00fcbler-Ross first introduced and explored the now-famous idea of the five stages of dealing with death: denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. With sample interviews and conversations, she gives the reader a better understanding of how imminent death affects the patient, the professionals who serve the patient, and the patient's family, bringing hope, solace, and peace of mind to all involved.<br />",

Once behind bars, they are frequently punished again for behavior that is psychotic, not criminal. A compelling and important examination of a shocking human rights abuse in our midst, Crazy in America is an indictment of a society that incarcerates its weakest and most vulnerable citizens \u2014 causing them to emerge sicker and more damaged.",

Written by three siblings, the letter told of their great-great-uncle Arthur Spiderwick and an unfinished tome filled with eyewitness accounts of creatures otherwise thought to be the stuff of legend. In the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling serial the Spiderwick Chronicles, readers were enthralled by the account of the those siblings, Jared, Simon, and Mallory Grace, as they battled dwarves, goblins, elves, and a diabolical ogre in their efforts to hold on to their uncle Spiderwick,s life work. Now, through the combined efforts of the Grace children and authors Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, Simon &amp; Schuster is thrilled to present that work to you! <p> Beginning with a thoughtful and informative introduction, progressing through six exhaustive sections featuring thirty-one faerie species, and culminating with an addendum that includes observations supplied by Jared Grace, this long-awaited compendium to the worldwide Spiderwick phenomenon delivers enough information to satisfy even the most demanding faerie enthusiast. Not only will readers learn the habits and habitats of the fourteen fantastical creatures featured in the <i>New York Times, USA Today,</i> and <i>Publishers Weekly</i> bestselling chapter books, but they will be delighted and astonished by an additional seventeen creatures. Also included are dozens of snippets from Arthur Spiderwick,s personal journal as well as cameos from a few series favorites. </p><p> With so much to offer, this book is destined to be pored over for generations to come! </p><p></p>",

    "description": "Are Christians merely forgiven, or do they possess the righteousness of Christ? Recently the time-honored understanding of the doctrine of justification has come under attack. Many question how\u2014or if\u2014we receive the full righteousness of Christ.<br /><br />Martin Luther said that if we understand justification \u201cwe are in the clearest light; if we do not know it, we dwell in the densest darkness.\u201d And now, in this new and important book, John Piper accepts Luther\u2019s challenge. He points out that we need to see ourselves as having been recipients of the imputation of Christ\u2019s righteousness and therefore enjoy full acceptance with God and the everlasting inheritance of life and joy.<br /><br />Piper writes as both a pastor and a scholar. His pastor\u2019s heart is shown in his zeal for the welfare of the church. His careful scholarship is evident in each explanation and undergirds each conclusion.",

From the epic adventures of \"Aladdin and the Enchanted Lamp\" to the farcical \"Young Woman and her Five Lovers\" and the social criticism of \"The Tale of the Hunchback\", the stories depict a fabulous world of all-powerful sorcerers, jinns imprisoned in bottles and enchanting princesses. But despite their imaginative extravagance, the Tales are anchored to everyday life by their realism, providing a full and intimate record of medieval Islam.'",

    "description": "Milan Kundera's lightest novel, a <em>divertimento</em>, an <em>opera buffa</em>, <em>Slowness</em> is also the first of this author's fictional works to have been written in French.<br /><br />Disconcerted and enchanted, the reader follows the narrator of <em>Slowness</em> through a midsummer's night in which two tales of seduction, separated by more than two hundred years, interweave and oscillate between the sublime and the comic. Underlying this libertine fantasy is a profound meditation on contemporary life: about the secret bond between slowness and memory, about the connection between our era's desire to forget and the way we have given ourselves over to the demon of speed. And about \"dancers\" possessed by the passion to be seen, for whom life is merely a perpetual show emptied of every intimacy and every joy.",

And through Cormac's remarkable adventures in both love and war, we come to know the city's buried secrets--the way it has been shaped by greed, race, and waves of immigration, by the unleashing of enormous human energies, and, above all, by hope.",

    "description": "Meet New York Times bestselling author Isabel Allende\u2019s most enchanting creation, <i>Eva Luna</i>: a lover, a writer, a revolutionary, and above all a storyteller\u2014available for the first time in ebook.<br /><br />Eva Luna is the daughter of a professor\u2019s assistant and a snake-bitten gardener\u2014born poor, orphaned at an early age, and working as a servant. Eva is a naturally gifted and imaginative storyteller who meets people from all stations and walks of life. Though she has no wealth, she trades her stories like currency with people who are kind to her. In this novel, she shares the story of her own life and introduces readers to a diverse and eccentric cast of characters including the Lebanese \u00e9migr\u00e9 who befriends her and takes her in; her unfortunate godmother, whose brain is addled by rum and who believes in all the Catholic saints and a few of her own invention; a street urchin who grows into a petty criminal and, later, a leader in the guerrilla struggle; a celebrated transsexual entertainer who instructs her in the ways of the adult world; and a young refugee whose flight from postwar Europe will prove crucial to Eva's fate.<br /><br />As Eva tells her story, Isabel Allende conjures up a whole complex South American nation\u2014the rich, the poor, the simple, and the sophisticated\u2014in a novel replete with character and incident, with drama and comedy and history, with battles and passions, rebellions and reunions, a novel that celebrates the power of imagination to create a better world.",

Pastor Jim Cymbala believes that Jesus wants to renew his people\u2014to call us back from spiritual dead ends, apathy, and lukewarm religion.Cymbala knows the difference firsthand. Thirty-five years ago his own church, the Brooklyn Tabernacle, was a struggling congregation of twenty. Then they began to pray \u2026 God began to move \u2026 street-hardened lives by the hundreds were changed by the love of Christ \u2026 and today they are more than ten thousand strong.The story of what happened to this broken-down church in one of America\u2019s toughest neighborhoods points the way to new spiritual vitality in the church and in your own life. Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire shows what the Holy Spirit can do when believers get serious about prayer and the gospel. As this compelling book reveals, God moves in life-changing ways when we set aside our own agendas, take him at his word, and listen for his voice.",

Her identical twin sister died in a horrifying farm accident when the girls were nine years old, and in the wake of the grief and guilt that followed, her older brother left home for good. The death of her mother prompts Annie to seek her brother and revisit her long-lost past. Her search takes her to Oaxaca, where her brother was last seen, during the vibrant Christmas celebrations and the colorful Night of the Radishes festival; and ultimately, deep within herself.",

    "description": "It has been said before, and it shall be said 1,000 times again: John Irving is the American Dickens. Rich in characterization, epic in scope, <i>The Cider House Rules</i> is the heart-wrenching story of orphan Homer Wells and his guardian, Dr. Wilbur Larch. With nods of affection to both David Copperfield and Jane Eyre, Irving's novel follows Homer on his journey from innocence to experience, brilliantly depicting the boy's struggle to find his place in the world. Irving also wrote an Oscar-winning screenplay for the 1999 film adaptation of the novel that starred Michael Caine, Tobey Maguire, and Charlize Theron.",

This is the life Nora Sinclair has dreamed about, the life she's worked hard for, the life she will never give up. <br /><br />She doesn't just attract men, she enthralls them. So why is FBI agent John O'Hara interested in Nora Sinclair? Mysterious things happen to people around her, especially the men. And there is something dangerous about Nora, something that lures O'Hara at the same time that it fills him with fear.<br /><br />Is something dark hidden in the gaps of her past? As O'Hara spends more and more time getting to know her, is he pursuing justice? Or his own fatal obsession?",

With nowhere else to go, he accepted the job as Chief of Police in a tiny, remote Alaskan town with the hopes of starting over. Despite the name, Lunacy provides a balm for Nate's shattered soul\u2014and an unexpected affair with pilot Meg Galloway warms his nights...<br /><br />But other things in Lunacy are heating up. Nate suspects the killer in an unsolved murder still walks the snowy streets. His investigation will unearth the secrets and suspicions that lurk beneath the placid surface, as well as bring out the big-city survival instincts that made him a cop in the first place.

    "description": "#1 <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling author Nora Roberts explores the wilds of the Grand Tetons-and the mysteries of love, murder, and madness-in her engrossing and passionate new novel.<br /><br />Reece Gilmore has come a long way to see the stunning view below her. As the sole survivor of a brutal crime back East, she has been on the run, desperately fighting the nightmares and panic attacks that haunt her. Reece settles in Angel's Fist, Wyoming-temporarily, at least-and takes a job at a local diner. And now she's hiked this mountain all by herself. It was glorious, she thought, as she peered through her binoculars at the Snake River churning below.<br /><br />Then Reece saw the man and woman on the opposite bank. Arguing. Fighting. And suddenly, the man was on top of the woman, his hands around her throat . . .<br /><br />Enjoying a moment of solitude a bit farther down the trail is a gruff loner named Brody. But by the time Reece reaches him and brings him to the scene, the pair has vanished. When authorities comb the area where she saw the attack, they find nothing. No signs of struggle. No freshly turned earth. Not even a tire track.<br /><br />And no one in Angel's Fist seems to believe her. After all, she's a newcomer in town, with a reputation for being jumpy and jittery-maybe even a little fragile. Maybe it's time to run again, to move on . . .<br /><br />Reece Gilmore knows there's a killer in Angel's Fist, even if Brody, despite his seeming impatience and desire to keep her at arm's length, is the only one willing to believe her. When a series of menacing events makes it clear that someone wants her out of the way, Reece must put her trust in Brody-and herself-to find out if there is a killer in Angel's Fist before it's too late.",

    "description": "Brilliant and innovative, Jacques Lacan's work has had a tremendous influence on contemporary discourse. Lacan lies at the epicenter of contemporary discourses about otherness, subjectivity, sexual difference, the drives, the law and enjoyment. Yet his seemingly impenetrable writing style has kept many a reader from venturing beyond page one. This new translation of selected writings from his most famous work offers welcome access to nine of his most significant contributions to psychoanalytic theory and technique. Ranging from \"The Mirror Stage\" to \"The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire in the Freudian Unconscious,\" and including \"The Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis\" and other papers on various aspects of psychoanalytic theory and practice, this selection spans some thirty years of Lacan's inimitable intellectual career.",

    "description": "When Prince Oroonoko's passion for the virtuous Imoinda arouses the jealousy of his grandfather, the lovers are cast into slavery and transported from Africa to the colony of Surinam. Oroonoko's noble bearing soon wins the respect of his English captors, but his struggle for freedom brings about his destruction. Inspired by Aphra Behn's visit to Surinam, <i>Oroonoko</i> reflects the author's romantic views of native peoples as being in \"the first state of innocence, before man knew how to sin.\" The novel also reveals Behn's ambiguous attitude toward slavery: while she favored it as a means to strengthen England's power, her powerful and moving work conveys its injustice and brutality.",

    "description": "Booker Prize-winning novelist Penelope Lively's latest masterpiece opens with a snapshot: Kath, before her death, at an unknown gathering, holding hands with a man who is not her husband. The photograph is in an envelope marked \"DON'T OPEN - DESTROY.\" But Kath's husband does not heed the warning, embarking on a journey of discovery that reveals a tight web of secrets: within marriages, between sisters, and at the heart of an affair. Kath, with her mesmerizing looks and casual ways, moves like a ghost through the memories of everyone who knew her - and a portrait emerges of a woman whose life cannot be understood without plumbing the emotional depths of the people she touched.<p><br />Propelled by the author's signature mastery of narrative and psychology, <i>The Photograph</i> is Lively at her very best, the dazzling climax to all she has written before.</p>",

    "description": "T he fast-changing business world of today is far different from just a few years ago. Success in today's marketplace requires new leadership techniques, new thinking, and an eye on the future . . . . <br /> In <i>Make It So: Leadership Lessons from </i>Star Trek: The Next Generation&amp;reg, Wess Roberts and coauthor Bill Ross take their inspiration from today's most striking and most popular vision of the future -- <i>Star Trek</i> -- an unprecedented television, feature film and publishing phenomenon. From the top-rated television series <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>, Roberts and Ross find a new symbol for successful leadership: Captain Jean-Luc Picard. <br /> As entertaining as it is useful, <i>Make It So</i> captures the mythos of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> as it delivers dramatically rich lessons on leadership, including the importance of the ability to focus on a single \"mission,\" effective communication, teamwork, honor . . . and other important concepts. The examples are taken from the on-screen adventures of Captain Picard and the <i>Starship Enterprise</i>TM, but the lessons and the benefits are real -- and can be applied to everyday situations where the goal is the kind of high-performance organization embodied by the crew of the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise</i>TM 1701-D. <br /> Sure to appeal to <i>Star Trek</i> enthusiasts and serious students of leadership alike, <i>Make It So</i> is the most exciting business book on the shelves -- the one book that shows the future of modern leadership while giving managers the tools they need for success today!",

    "description": "She soars above a world of warriors, kings, and priests. The daughter of Belgarath and the shape-shifter Poledra, she has fought wars, plotted palace coups, and worked her powerful magic for three thousand years. Now, Polgara looks back at her magnificent life, in this fitting crown jewel to the saga that is the Eddings' Belgariad and Mallorean cycles. <br /><br />Her hair streaked white by her father's first touch, her mind guided by a mother she will not see again for centuries, Polgara begins life in her Uncle Beldin's tower, and in the prehistorical, magical Tree that stands in the middle of the Vale. There, she first learns the reaches of her powers. There she assumes the bird shapes that will serve her on her adventures. And there she starts on the path toward her destiny as Duchess of Erat, shepherdess of the cause of good, adversary of Torak the One-Eyed Dragon God, and guardian of the world's last, best hope: the heir to the Rivan throne.<br /><br />Here is the legendary life story of a woman of wit, passion, and complex emotions, a woman born of two majestic parents who could not have been more unlike one another. Ordained to make peace and make war, to gain love and lose love, Polgara lives out her family's rich prophecy in the ceaseless struggle between the Light and the Dark.<br /><br />Polgara is the epic culmination of a magnificent saga, and a fitting farewell to a world which, once experienced, will never be forgotten.",

    "description": "Already winning acclaim as one of the best accounts of combat ever written, Black Hawk Down is a minute-by-minute, heart-stopping account of the 1993 raid on Mogadishu, Somalia. Late in the afternoon of Sunday, October 3 1993, 140 elite US Soldiers abseiled from helicopters into a teeming market neighbourhood in the heart of the city. Their mission was to abduct two top lieutenants of a Somali warlord and return to base. It was supposed to take them about an hour.<br /><br />Instead, they were pinned down through a long and terrible night in a hostile city, fighting for their lives against thousands of heavily armed Somalis. Two of their high-tech helicopters were shot out of the sky. When the unit was rescued the following morning, eighteen American soldiers were dead and more than seventy badly injured. The Somali toll was far worse - more than five hundred killed and over a thousand injured.<br /><br />Authoritative, gripping, and insightful, Black Hawk Down is destined to become a classic of war reporting. It is already the most accurate, detailed account of modern combat ever written.",

Join them as they chronicle that fateful conflict between two mortally opposed Destinies, in a monumental war of men and kings and Gods.<br /><br />When the world was young and Gods still walked among their mortal children, a headstrong orphan boy set out to explore the world. Thus began the extraordinary adventures that would mold that youthful vagabond into a man, and the man into the finely honed instrument of Prophecy known to all the world as Belgarath the Sorcerer.<br />Then came the dark day when the Dark God Torak split the world asunder, and the God Aldur and his disciples began their monumental labor to set Destiny aright. Foremost among their number was Belgarath. His ceaseless devotion was foredoomed to cost him that which he held most dear--even as his loyal service would extend through echoing centuries of loss, of struggle, and of ultimate triumph.",

    "description": "With <i>Trans-Sister Radio</i>, Chris Bohjalian, author of the bestseller <i>Midwives</i>, again confronts his very human characters with issues larger than themselves, here tackling the explosive issue of gender.<br /><br />When Allison Banks develops a crush on Dana Stevens, she knows that he will give her what she needs most: attention, gentleness, kindness, passion.

Men and women didn't make love, they collided. Tough brutes used their fists to drive home a message. Tougher broads used guile. And no one's morals were loftier than the gutter. No apologies. Little redemption. They rendered critics powerless, shocked intellectuals, inspired a new wave of pulp mayhem, and left the public hungry for more.<br /><br />Given their hot, fever-pitch prose and breathless pacing, Spillane\u2019s Mike Hammer novels quickly became one of the most successful series in publishing history\u2014an innovative, no-holds-barred, ultravisceral explosion of sex and violence that made Hammer a literary legend, and Spillane, one of the bestselling authors of all time. After fifty years, neither has lost their power to sucker punch the reader.<br /><br />Find out for yourself in this first-time ever omnibus featuring the first three Mike Hammer novels by the living master of the hard-boiled mystery\u2026",

    "description": "If you cut off a spider\u2019s leg, it\u2019s crippled; if you cut off its head, it dies. But if you cut off a starfish\u2019s leg it grows a new one, and the old leg can grow into an entirely new starfish.<br />What\u2019s the hidden power behind the success of Wikipedia, Craigslist, and Skype? What do eBay and General Electric have in common with the abolitionist and women\u2019s rights movements? What fundamental choice put General Motors and Toyota on vastly different paths? How could winning a Supreme Court case be the biggest mistake MGM could have made?<br /><br />After five years of ground-breaking research, Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom share some unexpected answers, gripping stories, and a tapestry of unlikely connections. The Starfish and the Spider argues that organizations fall into two categories: traditional \u201cspiders,\u201d which have a rigid hierarchy and top-down leadership, and revolutionary \u201cstarfish,\u201d which rely on the power of peer relationships.<br /><br />The Starfish and the Spider explores what happens when starfish take on spiders (such as the music industry vs. Napster, Kazaa, and the P2P services that followed). It reveals how established companies and institutions, from IBM to Intuit to the US government, are also learning how to incorporate starfish principles to achieve success. The book explores:<br /><br />* How the Apaches fended off the powerful Spanish army for 200 years<br />* The power of a simple circle<br />* The importance of catalysts who have an uncanny ability to bring people together <br />* How the Internet has become a breeding ground for leaderless organizations<br />* How Alcoholics Anonymous has reached untold millions with only a shared ideology and without a leader<br /><br />The Starfish and the Spider is the rare book that will change how you understand the world around you.",

    "description": "In a society where \"upward mobility\" is the highest goal, Bill Hybels asks a tough question: Do Christians place God's desires first-or their own? In Descending into Greatness, Hybels and writer Rob Wilkins take the example of Christ's downward journey as it was meant to be; the radical and essential answer for every Christian. In fourteen powerful chapters, the authors explore such topics as How Jesus managed power. The intentional decisions necessary to move down. The uplifting nature of true humility. Abundant life through dying to self. The ambush of joy. Moving down is never an easy matter that can be reduced to a formula. It involves a life committed to discipleship. Descending into Greatness introduces you to the touching stories of modern men and women committed to advancing the kingdom of God: from the pro football player, to the medical missionary, to a businessman wrestling with the priorities in the world of finance. Descending into Greatness asks tough questions and gives hopeful answers. Now, this powerful, urgent message also includes a discussion guide so that you can follow through, too. \"Like Christ, we must descend-into self-abandonment, unconditional giving, sacrifice, and death to self. And, like Christ, we will then ascend-into fulfillment, blessing, joy, and purpose.\"",

The God of the universe has given us an amazing, revolutionary gift of grace and freedom. This freedom and grace set us apart from every other \"religion\" on the face of the earth.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this best-selling classic, Charles Swindoll urges you not to miss living a grace-filled life. Freedom and joy-not lists and demands and duties-await all who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.",

Terror swiftly engulfs the country as Napoleon's army marches on Russia, and the lives of three young people are changed forever. The stories of quixotic Pierre, cynical Andrey and impetuous Natasha interweave with a huge cast, from aristocrats and peasants, to soldiers and Napoleon himself. In \"War and Peace\" (1868-9), Tolstoy entwines grand themes - conflict and love, birth and death, free will and fate - with unforgettable scenes of nineteenth-century Russia, to create a magnificent epic of human life in all its imperfection and grandeur.",

    "description": "Antonio Marez is six years old when Ultima enters his life. She is a curandera, one who heals with herbs and magic. 'We cannot let her live her last days in loneliness,' says Antonio's mother. 'It is not the way of our people,' agrees his father. And so Ultima comes to live with Antonio's family in New Mexico. Soon Tony will journey to the threshold of manhood. Always, Ultima watches over him. She graces him with the courage to face childhood bigotry, diabolical possession, the moral collapse of his brother, and too many violent deaths. Under her wise guidance, Tony will probe the family ties that bind him, and he will find in himself the magical secrets of the pagan past\u2014a mythic legacy equally as palpable as the Catholicism of Latin America in which he has been schooled. At each turn in his life there is Ultima who will nurture the birth of his soul.",

    "description": "Author of <b>Balkan Ghosts</b>, Robert D. Kaplan now travels from West Africa to Southeast Asia to report on a world of disintegrating nation-states, warring nationalities, metastasizing populations, and dwindling resources. He emerges with a gritty tour de force of travel writing and political journalism. Whether he is walking through a shantytown in the Ivory Coast or a death camp in Cambodia, talking with refugees, border guards, or Iranian revolutionaries, Kaplan travels under the most arduous conditions and purveys the most startling truths. Intimate and intrepid, erudite and visceral, <b>The Ends of the Earth</b> is an unflinching look at the places and peoples that will make tomorrow's headlines--and the history of the next millennium.<br /><br />\"Kaplan is an American master of...travel writing\u00a0\u00a0from hell...Pertinent and compelling.\"--New York Times Book Review<br /><br />\"An impressive work. Most travel books seem trivial beside it.\"--Washington Post Book World",

    "description": "Hillenbrand brilliantly re-creates a universal underdog story, one that proves life is a horse race.<br /><br />Seabiscuit was one of the most electrifying and popular attractions in sports history and the single biggest newsmaker in the world in 1938, receiving more coverage than FDR, Hitler, or Mussolini. But his success was a surprise to the racing establishment, which had written off the crooked-legged racehorse with the sad tail. Three men changed Seabiscuit\u2019s fortunes:<br /><br />Charles Howard was a onetime bicycle repairman who introduced the automobile to the western United States and became an overnight millionaire. When he needed a trainer for his new racehorses, he hired Tom Smith, a mysterious mustang breaker from the Colorado plains. Smith urged Howard to buy Seabiscuit for a bargain-basement price, then hired as his jockey Red Pollard, a failed boxer who was blind in one eye, half-crippled, and prone to quoting passages from Ralph Waldo Emerson. Over four years, these unlikely partners survived a phenomenal run of bad fortune, conspiracy, and severe injury to transform Seabiscuit from a neurotic, pathologically indolent also-ran into an American sports icon.<br /><br />Author Laura Hillenbrand brilliantly re-creates a universal underdog story, one that proves life is a horse race.",

    "description": "I'd gladly sell my soul to Satan for a year of freedom, cries impetuous Rosamond Vivian to her callous grandfather. Then, one stormy night, a brooding stranger appears in her remote island home, ready to take Rosamond to her word. Spellbound by the mysterious Philip Tempest, Rosamond is seduced with promises of love and freedom, then spirited away on Tempest's sumptuous yacht. But she soon finds herself trapped in a web of intrigue, cruelty, and deceit. Desperate to escape, she flees to Italy, France, and Germany, from Parisian garret to mental asylum, from convent to chateau, as Tempest stalks every step of the fiery beauty who has become his obsession. <br />A story of dark love and passionate obsession that was considered too sensational to be published in the authors lifetime, A Long Fatal Love Chase was written for magazine serialization in 1866, two years before the publication of Little Women. Buried among Louisa May Alcott's papers for more than a century, its publication is a literary landmark--a novel that is bold, timeless, and mesmerizing. From the Paperback edition.",

    "description": "Byron's exuberant masterpiece tells of the adventures of Don Juan, beginning with his illicit love affair at the age of sixteen in his native Spain and his subsequent exile to Italy. Following a dramatic shipwreck, his exploits take him to Greece, where he is sold as a slave, and to Russia, where he becomes a favourite of the Empress Catherine who sends him on to England. Written entirely in ottava rima stanza form, Byron's <i>Don Juan</i> blends high drama with earthy humour, outrageous satire of his contemporaries (in particular Wordsworth and Southey) and sharp mockery of Western societies, with England coming under particular attack.",

    "description": "In 1661, Lucas Turner, a barber surgeon, and his sister, Sally, an apothecary, stagger off a small wooden ship after eleven weeks at sea. Bound to each other by blood and necessity, they aim to make a fresh start in the rough and rowdy Dutch settlement of Nieuw Amsterdam; but soon lust, betrayal, and murder will make them mortal enemies. In their struggle to survive in the New World, Lucas and Sally make choices that will burden their descendants with a legacy of secrets and retribution, and create a heritage that sets cousin against cousin, physician against surgeon, and, ultimately, patriot against Tory.<br /><br />In what will be the greatest city in the New World, the fortunes of these two families are inextricably entwined by blood and fire in an unforgettable American saga of pride and ambition, love and hate, and the becoming of the dream that is New York City.",

    "description": "Joe DiMaggio was, at every turn, one man we could look at who made us feel good. In the hard-knuckled thirties, he was the immigrant boy who made it big\u2014and spurred the New York Yankees to a new era of dynasty. He was the Yankee Clipper, the icon of elegance, the man who wooed and won Marilyn Monroe\u2014the most beautiful girl America could dream up. Joe DiMaggio was a mirror of our best self. And he was also the loneliest hero we ever had.<br /><br />In this groundbreaking biography, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Richard Ben Cramer presents a shocking portrait of a complicated, enigmatic life. The story that DiMaggio never wanted told, tells of his grace\u2014and greed; his dignity, pride\u2014and hidden shame. It is a story that sweeps through the twentieth century, bringing to light not just America's national game, but the birth (and the price) of modern national celebrity.",

    "description": "<i>'When you remember that Dublin has been a capital for thousands of years,' James Joyce once wrote to his brother, 'that it is the \"second\" city of the British Empire, that it is nearly three times as big as Venice it seems strange that no artist has given it to the world'</i><br /><p>In <i>Dubliners,</i> completed when Joyce was only twenty-five, he produced a definitive group portrait. It is a book, as Terence Brown suggests in his stimulating Introduction, 'rooted in an intensely accurate apprehension of the detail of Dublin life.' Extensive notes to this new edition fill in the rich network of local and historical references. And yet, beyond its brilliant and almost brutal realism, it is also a book full of enigmas, ambiguities and symbolic resonances. <i>Dubliners</i> remains an undisputed masterpiece, a work that, in Brown's words, 'compels attention by the power of its unique vision of the world, its controlling sense of the truths of human experience as its author discerned them in a defeated, colonial city'.</p>",

They encounter severe food shortages in Mali, military roadblocks in Nigeria, and corrupt border guards all over. In Mauritania they meet a young girl who offers to give Jones her baby sister. As they pass through the ever-changing face of Africa toward a meeting with the Queen of the Lovedu, Jones is perceptive, funny, moving, astute\u2013everything a good travel writer should be.

    "description": "A fascinating insight into the vibrant culture of Modernism, and the rich artistic world of Paris's Left Bank, Gertrude Stein's <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> includes an introduction by Thomas Fensch in Penguin Modern Classics.<br /><br />For Gertrude Stein and her wife Alice B. Toklas, life in Paris was based upon the rue de Fleurus and the Saturday evenings and 'it was like a kaleidoscope slowly turning'. Picasso was there with 'his high whinnying Spanish giggle', as were Cezanne and Matisse, Hemingway and Fitzgerald. As Toklas put it - 'The geniuses came and talked to Gertrude Stein and the wives sat with me'. A light-hearted entertainment, this is in fact Gertrude Stein's own autobiography and a roll-call of all the extraordinary painters and writers she met between 1903 and 1932. Audacious, sardonic and characteristically self-confident, this is a definitive account by American in Paris.<br /><br />Gertrude Stein (1874-1946), a writer of experimental prose, is one of the original American Modernists. Born in Pennsylvania, she lived most of her life in Paris with her partner, Alice B. Toklas. Experimental books like <i>Three Lives</i> (1909), <i>Tender Buttons</i> (1914), and <i>The Making of Americans</i> (1925) established her reputation as an avant-garde stylist, and <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> made her an international celebrity. As an experimental writer she has been an inspiration to countless novelists and poets in our century, from Ernest Hemingway and Edith Sitwell in her own time to Jack Kerouac and Robert Duncan in ours.<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>, you might like Virginia Woolf's <i>Orlando</i>, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.<br /><br />'Buttonholes the reader with its informality, its unhurried rhythms, deadpan humour and acerbic remarks'<br />Frances Spalding, <i>Sunday Times</i>",

    "description": "Reversals, transformations, and surprises abound in these assured stories. Parables for our times--with a hint of the reckless and the absurd that we have come to expect from Ha Jin--The Bridegroom offers tales both mischievous and wise.<br /><br />From the National Book Award-winning author of Waiting, a new collection of short fiction that confirms Ha Jin's reputation as a master storyteller.<br /><br />Each of The Bridegroom's twelve stories--three of which have been selected for inclusion in The Best American Short Stories--takes us back to Muji City in contemporary China, the setting of Waiting. It is a world both exotic and disarmingly familiar, one in which Chinese men and women meet with small epiphanies and muted triumphs, leavening their lives of quiet desperation through subtle insubordination and sometimes crafty resolve.<br /><br />In the title story, a seemingly model husband joins a secret men's literary club and finds himself arrested for the \"bourgeois crime\" of homosexuality. \"Alive\" centers on an official who loses his memory in an earthquake and lives happily for months as a simple worker; when he suddenly remembers who he is, he finds that his return to his old life proves inconvenient for everyone. In \"A Tiger-Fighter Is Hard to Find,\" a television crew's inept attempt to film a fight scene with a live Siberian tiger lands their lead actor in a mental hospital, convinced that he is the mythical tiger-fighter Wu Song.<br /><br />Reversals, transformations, and surprises abound in these assured stories, as Ha Jin seizes on the possibility that things might not be as they seem. Parables for our times--with a hint of the reckless and the absurd that we have come to expect from Ha Jin--The Bridegroom offers tales both mischievous and wise.",

Michael Shinagel has collated the reprint with all six authorized editions published by Taylor in 1719 to achieve a text that is faithful to Defoe's original edition. Annotations assist the reader with obscure words and idioms, biblical references, and nautical terms.<br /><br />\"Contexts\" helps the reader understand the novel\u2019s historical and religious significance. Included are four contemporary accounts of marooned men, Defoe\u2019s autobiographical passages on the novel\u2019s allegorical foundation, and aspects of the Puritan emblematic tradition essential for understanding the novel\u2019s religious aspects.<br /><br />\"Eighteenth-and Nineteenth-Century Opinions\" is a comprehensive survey of early estimations by prominent literary and political figures, including Alexander Pope, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Samuel Johnson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, Edgar Allan Poe, Thomas Babington Macaulay, Charles Dickens, Karl Marx, and John Stuart Mill.<br /><br />\"Twentieth-Century Criticism\" is a collection of fourteen essays (five of them new to the Second Edition) that presents a variety of perspectives on \"Robinson Crusoe\" by Virginia Woolf, Ian Watt, Eric Berne, Maximillian E. Novak, Frank Budgen, James Joyce, George A. Starr, J. Paul Hunter, James Sutherland, John J. Richetti, Leopold Damrosch, Jr., John Bender, Michael McKeon, and Carol Houlihan Flynn.<br /><br />A Chronology of Defoe\u2019s life and work and an updated Selected Bibliography are also included.",

She sees things that can only be described as weird-shapes emerging from a foggy grey mist, snarling teeth, creatures roaring.But Harper's not crazy. Her \"death\" has made her a Greywalker-able to move between our world and the mysterious, cross-over zone where things that go bump in the night exist. And her new gift (or curse) is about to drag her into that world of vampires and ghosts, magic and witches, necromancers and sinister artifacts. Whether she likes it or not.",

He's won some money and glory fighting pirates in the Mediterranean and expects a speedy election to the office of praetor.<br /><br />That all changes when a man he's never seen before publicly accuses him of corruption. Decius and his powerful family of Rome's leading politicians scramble to prepare a defense. However, the day of the trial they are greeted with a strange surprise on the steps of the courthouse: the corpse of the man who made the accusation. Now Decius is up against a much more serious charge of murder. It may cost him his chance to run for office, but not if he can help it.<br /><br />Roberts once again masterfully sets Decius and his adventures against the background of this famed and crumbling Republic, enriching his story with historical detail and the immortal personalities of the day.",

    "description": "Part sports star, part antihero, part hip-hop icon, Allen Iverson has managed to cross over into the mainstream of American culture -- without compromise. Defiantly tattooed, with his hair in cornrows, the six-foot Philadelphia 76ers point guard is one of the most recognizable and controversial stars of the sports world. His meteoric rise from a troubled childhood in the ghetto to NBA superstardom has been marked by five straight playoff appearances, including a finals berth in 2001 and an MVP award. From his rap sheet to his rap album, fans and journalists alike hound his every move. But never before has a biographer presented a full portrait of this complicated and intensely private star -- a man whose loyalty to his family, the streets, and his friends trumps any other concern. Filled with exclusive interview material and unprecedented access to many of Iverson's inner circle, <em>Only the Strong Survive</em> is the first in-depth look at the truth behind this newly minted legend.",

    "description": "July 1698. Sano Ichiro, the samurai detective who has risen to become the shogun's second-in-command, is investigating rumors of a plot to overthrow the ruling regime. When the investigation brings Sano's deputy Hirata to Lord Mori's estate, he is shocked to find Lord Mori murdered and grotesquely mutilated in his own bed, and Sano's pregnant wife, Reiko, lying beside him. The only solid clue is a chrysanthemum soaked in blood. <br /> Reiko's account of her actions is anything but solid. She insists that she went undercover to Lord Mori's estate in order to investigate claims that he molested and murdered young boys. But when Sano inspects the crime scene, he finds no trace of what Reiko described. And every other witness tells a different story: Lady Mori alleges that Reiko was Lord Mori's scorned mistress and murdered him for revenge. And Lord Mori himself, speaking through a medium, claims his murder was part of Sano's plot to overthrow the shogun! <br /> Unless Sano can prove his wife's unlikely claims, both he and Reiko--and their unborn child--face execution for treason. Sano fights desperately to save his family and his honor, as Laura Joh Rowland draws on the tradition of the classic film \"Rashomon\" to bring us a masterful tale of intrigue and treachery.",

    "description": "This extended essay by one of the world's leading historians seeks, in its first part, to excavate and vindicate the neo-Roman theory of free citizens and free states as it developed in early modern Britain. This analysis leads to a powerful defense of the nature, purposes and goals of intellectual history and the history of ideas. In this concise yet powerful account, derived from his inaugural lecture as Regius Professor at Cambridge, Quentin Skinner provides one of the most substantial statements yet made about the importance, relevance and excitement of this form of historical enquiry.",

These stories of love, survival, and family blend the supernatural with the rich, little known history of the Philippines, the centuries of Spanish colonization, the power of the Catholic church, and the colorful worlds of the Spanish, Mestizo, and Filipino cultures.<br /><br />As the villagers tell their stories in the darkened cellar below, Holthe masterfully weaves in the stories of three brave Filipinos--a teenage brother and sister and a guerilla fighter--as they become caught in the battle against the vicious Japanese forces above ground.<br /><br />Inspired by her father's firsthand accounts of this period, Tess Uriza Holthe brings to magical and terrifying life a story of the hope and courage needed to survive in wartime.<br /><br />\"Voices once silent sing out load and clear...A powerful tale of the Philippine Islands and a testament to the resilience and courage of the Filipino people.\"--Gail Tsukiyama, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br /><br />\"Readers who loved Gabriel Garcia Marquez's <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> or Isabelle Allende's <i>The House of the Spirits</i> will welcome this novel.\"--<i>The New Orleans Times-Picayune</i>",

In the blue had been my place to hide, now In the raw there was nowhere to hide. </i><br /><br />Jenna Abbott separates her life into two categories: before the wreck and after the wreck, Before the wreck, she was leading a normal life with her mom in suburban New York. After the wreck, Jenna is alone, trying desperately to forget what happened that day on the bridge. She's determined not to let anyone get close to her -- she never wants to feel so broken and fragile again. <br /><br />Then Jenna meets Crow. He is a powerfully seductive enigma, and Jenna is instantly drawn to him. Crow is able to break down the wall that Jenna has built around her emotions, and she surprises herself by telling him things she hasn't told anyone else. Can Jenna bring herself to face the memories she's tried so hard to erase?",

    "description": "A dangerous ring of spies, a game of mistaken identities, and a heartwarming romance of unlikely pairs come together in Lauren Willig's engaging and exciting third novel <i>THE DECPTION OF THE EMERALD RING</i>. Praised for the \"cheerfully postmodern and energetic . . .romance-adventure hybrids [that] have escaped the clutches of niche fiction.\" (<i>The Onion</i> A.V. Club), her Pink Carnation series is garnering her critical acclaim and a loyal fan base. <br /><br /> Lauren Willig's debut <i>The Secret History of the Pink Carnation</i>, appeared on retailer bestseller lists in hardcover and made a big splash in sales in trade paperback. Her second book, <i>The Masque of the Black Tulip</i>, was selected as a BookSense Pick for January 2006, and continue to rack up incredible reviews. Lauren Willig's passion for authentic historical detail coupled with her talent for enthralling love stories make her series the perfect read for lovers of romance, history and adventure. <p> The year is 1803 and England and France remain at odds. Hoping to break the English once and for all, Napoleon backs a ring of Irish rebels in uprisings against England and sends the Black Tulip, France's most deadly spy, to the Emerald Isle to help. What they don't know is that also in Ireland is England's top spy, the Pink Carnation, who is working to shut the rebels down. Meanwhile, back in England, Letty Alsworthy intercepts a note indicating that her sister, Mary, is about to make the very grave mistake of eloping with Geoffrey Pinchingdale-Snipe (second in command of the League of the Purple Gentian). In an attempt to save the family name, Letty tries to stop the elopement, but instead finds herself swept away in the midnight carriage meant for her sister and is accidentally compromised. Geoff and Letty, to each other's horror, find themselves forced into matrimony. Then, Geoff receives word that he is to travel to Ireland to help the Pink Carnation and disappears immediately after their wedding ceremony. Letty learns of Geoff's disappearance and, not to be outdone by her husband, steals away on a ship bound for Ireland, armed and ready to fight for her husband\u0085and to learn a thing or two about spying for England. </p><p>\t As in her previous tales, <i>The Secret History of the Pink Carnation</i> and <i>The Masque Of the Black tulip</i>, our modern-day heroine and hero, Eloise Kelly and Colin Selwick, continue their budding romance in this captivating third novel in the series.</p>",

    "description": "Spellbinding in its imagery and ancient myths, Shark Dialogues is the stunningly sensual and visionary epic of a Polynesian Hawaiian family, a story of daring, passionate women and men, their losses and triumphs, their comedies and tragedies, their anguish and joy. Set mainly in contemporary Hawaii, it is a spectacular odyssey through fire and water, a journey that begins in the nineteenth century with the fateful meeting of a Yankee sailor and the runaway daughter of a Tahitian chief. Sweeping from that distant past into the present turbulent decade, Kiana Davenport has woven an astonishing, compassionate portrait of her people, one of personal and political complexities - a surreal and provocative, wise and erotic tale of villains and dreamers, of \"stone-eaters\" and queens, of revolutionaries, and of lepers and healers. Central to all is the matriarch Pono, a statuesque, pure-blooded Hawaiian, a kahuna, or seer, whose past is shrouded in mystery.

United by their fear of and devotion to Pono, each woman is of \"mixed blood\" parentage: Ming - Hawaiian-Chinese, is a lover of art and music, who suffers from lupus; Vanya - Hawaiian-Filipino, is a lawyer and a fiery political activist; Rachel - Hawaiian-Japanese, is a great beauty, obsessed with herYakuza husband; JessHawaiian-Caucasian, is a veterinarian, whose pale skin makes her \"inferior\" in Pono's eyes. Never having known their true genealogy \"Pono's girls, \" as they are called, have led tormented, scattered lives. Now, caught up in Pono's spell, feeling a sense of \"immi",

    "description": "When Zlata\u2019s Diary was first published at the height of the Bosnian conflict, it became an international bestseller and was compared to <i>The Diary of Anne Frank</i>, both for the freshness of its voice and the grimness of the world it describes. It begins as the day-today record of the life of a typical eleven-year-old girl, preoccupied by piano lessons and birthday parties. But as war engulfs Sarajevo, Zlata Filipovic becomes a witness to food shortages and the deaths of friends and learns to wait out bombardments in a neighbor\u2019s cellar. Yet throughout she remains courageous and observant. The result is a book that has the power to move and instruct readers a world away.",

For months he watched as Luanda and then the rest of the country collapsed into a civil war that was in the author's words 'sloppy, dogged and cruel'. In his account, Kapuscinski demonstrates an extraordinary capacity to describe and to explain the individual meaning of grand political abstractions.",

Holmes, master of disguise, reasoned logically to deduce clients' background from their first appearance. He used fingerprints, chemical analysis, and forensic science.\n    \n    The majority of the stories were first published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>  accumulated to four novels and fifty-six short stories set 1880-1914.\n    \n    All but four stories are narrated by Holmes's friend and biographer, Dr John H. Watson; two are narrated by Holmes himself (<i>The Blanched Soldier</i> and <i>The Lion's Mane</i>) and two others are written in the third person (<i>The Mazarin Stone</i> and <i>His Last Bow</i>). In two stories (<i>The Musgrave Ritual</i> and <i>The Gloria Scott</i>), Holmes tells Watson the main story from his memories, while Watson becomes the narrator of the frame story. The first and fourth novels, <i>A Study in Scarlet</i> and <i>The Valley of Fear</i>, each include long omniscient narration of events unknown to Holmes or Watson.",

    "description": "The Rice Room is a brilliant and moving memoir of growing up in Oakland's Chinatown, by one of America's preeminent journalists. Ben Fong-Torres was the third child of first-generation Chinese parents. His father came to America via the Philippines, adding \"Torres\" to his name to convince immigration officials that he was Filipino, since there were strict limits on the number of Chinese immigrants that were allowed. His mother came into the country under similarly deceptive circumstances. Together they set up a life that did not include outsiders, and they assumed that their children would share their views. But for Ben and his siblings, including older brother and Number One Son Barry, this was never an option. As youngsters, they loved exploring the sights and sounds of their immediate neighborhood, and spent much of their time working and studying in the rice room of their family restaurant, isolated from outsiders. But going to an American school made them aware of an entirely different world, and soon Ben and Barry were shocking their parents by reciting American song lyrics, reading American comic books, and even listening to forbidden rock and roll lp's. At age twelve, Ben went with his father to Amarillo, Texas, to open a restaurant. There he was thrown into a strange new community, many of whose members had never laid eyes upon an Asian person before. Ben combatted his loneliness by hard work, learning to lip-synch to Elvis, and tentatively making a few friends, ignoring the comments of those such as his gym teacher, who called him \"Chop-Chop.\" By the time he returned to Oakland, he was much more aware of how the rest of the country might view his family, and he was more determined than ever to have a piece of the American pie. Working in the detested rice room made Ben and his siblings realize how much was expected of them as Chinese sons and daughters. Yet Ben continued to be obedient, at least on the surface - in the meantime holding down newspaper",

    "description": "\"God makes it quite clear in his Word that he has only one answer to every human need--his Son, Jesus Christ. In all his dealings with us he works by taking us out of the way and substituting Christ in our place. The Son of God died instead of us for our forgiveness: he lives instead of us for our deliverance. So we can speak of two substitutions--a Substitute on the Cross who secures our forgiveness and a Substitute within who secures our victory.\"<br /><br />An early leader in what became China's phenomenal house church movement, Watchman Nee (1903-1972) spent the last 20 years of his life in a communist prison. This powerful meditation brings the daily reality of following Christ into sharp focus.<br /><br />Hendrickson Christian Classics<br />Every Christian library needs the classics--the timeless books that have spoken powerfully to generations of believers. Hendrickson Christian Classics allow readers to build an essential classics library in affordable modern editions. Each volume is freshly retypeset for reading comfort, while thoughtful new introductions place each in historical and spiritual context. Attractive, classically bound covers look great together on the shelf. Best of all, value pricing makes this series easy to own. Planned to span the spectrum of Christian wisdom through the ages, Hendrickson Christian Classics set a new standard for quality and value.<br />",

    "description": "This New York Times bestseller is a fast-paced, behind-the-scenes book that blows the lid off the intriguing world of mainstream sorority life.<br /><br />Alexandra Robbins wanted to find out if the stereotypes about sorority girls were actually true, so she spent a year with a group of girls in a typical sorority. The sordid behavior of sorority girls exceeded her worst expectations -- drugs, psychological abuse, extreme promiscuity, racism, violence, and rampant eating disorders are just a few of the problems. But even more surprising was the fact that these abuses were inflicted and endured by intelligent, successful, and attractive women. <br /><br />Why is the desire to belong to a sorority so powerful that women are willing to engage in this type of behavior -- specially when the women involved are supposed to be considered \"sisters\"? What definition of sisterhood do many women embrace? Pledged combines a sharp-eyed narrative with extensive reporting and the fly-on-the-wall.",

Armed with the spirit of adventure and na\u00efve optimism, the inhabitants of \u201cDrop City\u201d arrive in the wilderness of Alaska only to find their utopia already populated by other young homesteaders. When the two communities collide, unexpected friendships and dangerous enmities are born as everyone struggles with the bare essentials of life: love, nourishment, and a roof over one\u2019s head. Rich, allusive, and unsentimental, T.C. Boyle\u2019s ninth novel is a tour de force infused with the lyricism and take-no-prisoners storytelling for which he is justly famous.",

    "description": "No play in the modern theatre has so captured the imagination and heart of the American public as Tennessee Williams's The Glass Menagerie. As Williams's first popular success, it launched the brilliant, if somewhat controversial, career, of our pre-eminent lyric playwright. Since its premiere in Chicago in 1944, with the legendary Laurette Taylor in the role of Amanda, Menagaerie has been the bravura piece for great actresses from Jessica Tandy to Joanne Woodward, and is studied and performed in classrooms and theatres around the world. <br /><br />The Glass Menagerie (in the reading text the author preferred) is now available only in its New Directions Paperbook edition. A new introduction by the editor of The Tennessee Williams Annual Review, Robert Bray, reappraises the play more than half a century after it won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award. This edition of The Glass Menagerie also includes Williams's essay on the impact of sudden fame on a struggling writer, \"The Catastrophe of Success,\" as well as a short section of Williams's own \"Production Notes.\" <br />(back cover)",

    "description": "Since its first publication in 1890, Oscar Wilde's only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, has remained the subject of critical controversy. Acclaimed by some as an instructive moral tale, it has been denounced by others for its implicit immorality. After having his portrait painted, Dorian Gray is captivated by his own beauty. Tempted by his world-weary friend, decadent friend Lord Henry Wotton, he wished to stay young forever and pledges his very soul to keep his good looks. As Dorian's slide into crime and cruelty progresses, he stays magically youthful, while his beautiful portrait changes, revealing the hideous corruption of moral decay.<br /> Set in fin-de-siecle London, the novel traces a path from the studio of painter Basil Howard to the opium dens of the East End. The text of this edition is derived from the Oxford English Texts, which prints a critically established version of the first book edition of 1891. Also included is a new, fuller introduction, which considers the difference between the 1890 and 1891 texts, Wilde's range of sources, significant critical approaches to the novel and its reputation since 1891, full explanatory notes that identify Wilde's sources, and an up-to-date-bibliography.<br />\"",

    "description": "A Civil Action is a non-fiction book by Jonathan Harr about a water contamination case in Woburn, Massachusetts, in the 1980s. <br /><br />After finding that her child is diagnosed with leukemia, Anne Anderson notices a high prevalence of leukemia, a relatively rare disease, in her city. Eventually she gathers other families and seeks a lawyer, Jan Schlichtmann, to consider their options.<br /><br />Schlichtmann originally decides not to take the case due to both the lack of evidence and a clear defendant. Later picking up the case, Schlichtmann finds evidence suggesting trichloroethylene (TCE) contamination of the town's water supply by Riley Tannery, a subsidiary of Beatrice Foods; a chemical company, W. R. Grace; and another company named Unifirst.<br /><br />In the course of the lawsuit Schlichtmann gets other attorneys to assist him. He spends lavishly as he had in his prior lawsuits, but the length of the discovery process and trial stretch all of their assets to their limit.",

    "description": "Face-to-face with a jaguar, Yossi Ghinsberg is not merely deep in the jungle, he's in deep trouble.<br /><br />Four backpackers set out for the heart of the Amazon... Marcus, the frail Swiss mystic; Karl, the shifty Austrian geologist with a shady past; Kevin, the well-intentioned American photographer; and Yossi, the Israeli dreamer and eager reporter. But what begins as a dream adventure quickly deteriorates into a dangerous nightmare, and after weeks of wandering in the dense undergrowth the four backpackers split up. Of the four who set out, only two will come back.<br /><br /><i>Heart of the Amazon</i> is the incredible true story of Yossi's triumph over the most adverse and frightening of circumstances. This is a tale of survival and human fortitude against the wildest backdrop on the planet.<br /><br />This book was originally published in Hebrew as <i>Ba-h\u0323azarah mi-T\u0323u\u02bcits'i</i>. It was translated into English by Yael Politis and Stanley Young. It has been published in several countries under different names, including <i>Heart of the Amazon: The Harrowing Life-and-Death Story of Survival in the South American Jungle</i>, <i>Back from Tuichi: The Harrowing Life-and-Death Story of Survival in the Amazon Rainforest</i>, and <i>Jungle: A Harrowing True Story of Survival in the Amazon</i>. His story was also made into a movie <i>Jungle</i> starring Daniel Radcliffe as Yossi, and featured in the documentary series <i>I Shouldn't Be Alive</i> on the Discovery Channel.",

He writes with equal force about the blithe energies of youth (\"Boys\") and the rueful onset of middle age (\"Hawaiian Night\"), about Midwestern optimists (\"Double Zero\") and West coast strategists (\"Baggage Carousel\"), about visionary exhilaration (\"Forecast from the Retail Desk\") and delusional catharsis (\"Surplus Value Books: Catalog Number 13.\") The astounding title story, which has already been reprinted in four different anthologies, is a masterpiece of remembrance and thwarted love.<br />Full of deep feeling and stunningly beautiful language, the stories in Demonology offer the deepest pleasures that fiction can afford. <br />",

Two years earlier, Brian was stranded alone in the wilderness for fifty-four days with nothing but a small hatchet. Yet he survived. Now the government wants him to do it again to go back into the wilderness so that astronauts and the military can learn the survival techniques that kept Brian alive.</p><p></p><p>This time he won't be alone: Derek Holtzer, a government psychologist, will accompany him to observe and take notes. But during a freak storm, Derek is hit by lightning and falls into a coma. Their radio transmitter is dead. Brian is afraid that Derek will die of dehydration unless he can get him to a doctor. His only hope is to build a raft and try to transport Derek a hundred miles down the river to a trading post if the map he has is accurate.</p>",

And the way she raises her kids is a scandal. But as time passes, the neighbors start having second thoughts about Nora. The women\u2019s apprehension evolves into admiration. The men\u2019s lust evolves into awe. The children are drawn to her in ways they can't explain. And everyone on this little street in 1959 Long Island seems to sense the possibilities and perils of a different kind of future when they look at Nora Silk...<br /><br />This extraordinary novel by the author of <b>The River King</b> and <b>Local Girls</b> takes us back to a time when the exotic both terrified and intrigued us, and despite our most desperate attempts, our passions and secrets remained as stubbornly alive as the weeds in our well-trimmed lawns.",

But did you realize that, open or closed, books can also make your real world--your home--more fabulous? As legendary designer Billy Baldwin pointed out, they're \u201cthe best decoration,\u201d capable of bringing incredible warmth, color, and character to a room. From grand bookcases in home libraries to casual stacks artfully arrayed on chairs, <i>House Beautiful </i>presents countless eye-catching ideas for displaying and arranging your hardcovers, paperbacks, encyclopedias, and even valuable first editions. Useful tips shed light on how to organize a large collection; situate bookcases in the room for the best effect; and make the most of books' appealing visual and tactile qualities. From traditional interpretations to contemporary visions--such as putting a book on a pedestal as an <i>objet d'art</i>--these concepts write a new page in design.",

    "description": "Once in a great while, we encounter a novel in our voluminous reading that begs to be read aloud. Leif Enger's debut, <i>Peace Like a River</i>, is one such work. His richly evocative novel, narrated by an asthmatic 11-year-old named Reuben Land, is the story of Reuben's unusual family and their journey across the frozen Badlands of the Dakotas in search of his fugitive older brother. Charged with the murder of two locals who terrorized their family, Davy has fled, understanding that the scales of justice will not weigh in his favor. But Reuben, his father, Jeremiah\u2014a man of faith so deep he has been known to produce miracles\u2014and Reuben's little sister, Swede, follow closely behind the fleeing Davy.<br /><br />Affecting and dynamic, <i>Peace Like a River</i> is at once a tragedy, a romance, and an unflagging exploration into the spirituality and magic possible in the everyday world, and in that of the world awaiting us on the other side of life. In Enger's superb debut effort, we witness a wondrous celebration of family, faith, and spirit, the likes of which we haven't seen in a long, long time\u2014and the birth of a classic work of literature.",

    "description": "In a dazzlingly original work of nonfiction, the award-winning novelist Colson Whitehead re-creates the exuberance, the chaos, the promise, and the heartbreak of New York. Here is a literary love song that will entrance anyone who has lived in\u2014or spent time\u2014in the greatest of American cities.<b>\n  <br /></b><br />A masterful evocation of the city that never sleeps, <i>The Colossus of New York</i> captures the city\u2019s inner and outer landscapes in a series of vignettes, meditations, and personal memories. Colson Whitehead conveys with almost uncanny immediacy the feelings and thoughts of longtime residents and of newcomers who dream of making it their home; of those who have conquered its challenges; and of those who struggle against its cruelties. <br /><br />Whitehead\u2019s style is as multilayered and multifarious as New York itself: Switching from third person, to first person, to second person, he weaves individual voices into a jazzy musical composition that perfectly reflects the way we experience the city. There is a funny, knowing riff on what it feels like to arrive in New York for the first time; a lyrical meditation on how the city is transformed by an unexpected rain shower; and a wry look at the ferocious battle that is commuting. The plaintive notes of the lonely and dispossessed resound in one passage, while another captures those magical moments when the city seems to be talking directly to you, inviting you to become one with its rhythms. <br /><br /><i>The Colossus of New York</i> is a remarkable portrait of life in the big city. Ambitious in scope, gemlike in its details, it is at once an unparalleled tribute to New York and the ideal introduction to one of the most exciting writers working today.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

Siena was six -- and her dreams kept skipping and leaping, circling and spinning, from airy runs along a beach near her home in Puerto Rico, to dance class in Boston, to her debut performance on stage with the New York City Ballet. <br /><br /><i>To Dance</i> tells <i>and shows</i> the fullness of her dreams and her rhapsodic life they led to. Part family history, part backstage drama, here is an original, firsthand book about a young dancer's beginnings -- and beyond.",

    "description": "<i>Twilight in the Desert</i> reveals a Saudi oil and production industry that could soon approach a serious, irreversible decline. In this exhaustively researched book, veteran oil industry analyst Matthew Simmons draws on his three-plus decades of insider experience and more than 200 independently produced reports about Saudi petroleum resources and production operations. He uncovers a story about Saudi Arabia's troubled oil industry, not to mention its political and societal instability, which differs sharply from the globally accepted Saudi version. It's a story that is provocative and disturbing, based on undeniable facts, but until now never told in its entirety. Twilight in the Desert answers all readers' questions about Saudi oil and production industries with keen examination instead of unsubstantiated posturing, and takes its place as one of the most important books of this still-young century.",

    "description": "A modern classic in the African literary canon and voted in the Top Ten Africa's 100 Best Books of the 20th Century, this novel brings to the politics of decolonization theory the energy of women's rights. An extraordinarily well-crafted work, this book is a work of vision. Through its deft negotiation of race, class, gender and cultural change, it dramatizes the 'nervousness' of the 'postcolonial' conditions that bedevil us still. In Tambu and the women of her family, we African women see ourselves, whether at home or displaced, doing daily battle with our changing world with a mixture of tenacity, bewilderment and grace.",

    "description": "All Jin Wang wants is to fit in. When his family moves to a new neighborhood, he suddenly finds that he's the only Chinese American student at his school. Jocks and bullies pick on him constantly, and he has hardly any friends. Then, to make matters worse, he falls in love with an all-American girl...<br /><br />Born to rule over all the monkeys in the world, the story of the Monkey King is one of the oldest and greatest Chinese fables. Adored by his subjects, master of the arts of kung-fu, he is the most powerful monkey on earth. But the Monkey King doesn't want to be a monkey. He wants to be hailed as a god...<br /><br />Chin-Kee is the ultimate negative Chinese stereotype, and he's ruining his cousin Danny's life. Danny's a popular kid at school, but every year Chin-Kee comes to visit, and every year Danny has to transfer to a new school to escape the shame. This year, though, things quickly go from bad to worse...<br /><br />These three apparently unrelated tales come together with an unexpected twist, in a modern fable that is hilarious, poignant and action-packed. <i>American Born Chinese</i> is an amazing rise, all the way up to the astonishing climax--and confirms what a growing number of readers already know: Gene Yang is a major talent.",

    "description": "Linguist, critic, poet, psychologist, I. A. Richards (1893-1979) was one of the great polymaths of the twentieth century. He is best known, however, as one of the founders of modern literary critical theory. Richards revolutionized criticism by turning away from biographical and historical readings as well as from the aesthetic impressionism. Seeking a more exacting approach, he analyzed literary texts as syntactical structures that could be broken down into smaller interacting verbal units of meaning. Practical Criticism, first published in 1929, is a landmark volume in demonstrating this method.Practical Criticism was born of an experiment Richards undertook to discern the psychological foundations of reading and interpretation and a means for readers to discover how they think and feel about poetry. He submitted thirteen poems for analysis, without date or author given, to some four hundred of his Cambridge students. Poets of stature went in undifferentiated from obscure and forgotten figures. The results were mixed at best, with many of the interpretations shockingly bad. These readings were based, in large part, not on the texts themselves but on then-current opinions, presuppositions, theories, and beliefs. The results led Richards to define a set of interrelated mental obstacles to intelligent and accurate reading including \"irrelevant associations,\" \"stock responses,\" \"sentimentality,\" and a general misunderstanding of the purpose or \"doctrine\" of poetry.Richards' concerns in Practical Criticism went well beyond the merely formal. In the humanist tradition, he believed that the ability to read critically and use language truthfully was culturally regenerative, a necessary skill in the modern world of mass-produced art and advertising. This classic volume will be of interest to teachers of literature, cultural studies specialists, and intellectual historians.",

    "description": "It sounds like a fairy tale. He is a boy dressed in silks and white wigs and given the finest of classical educations. Raised by a group of rational philosophers known only by numbers, the boy and his mother -- a princess in exile from a faraway land -- are the only persons in their household assigned names. As the boy's regal mother, Cassiopeia, entertains the house scholars with her beauty and wit, young Octavian begins to question the purpose behind his guardians' fanatical studies. Only after he dares to open a forbidden door does he learn the hideous nature of their experiments -- and his own chilling role in them. Set against the disquiet of Revolutionary Boston, M. T. Anderson's extraordinary novel takes place at a time when American Patriots rioted and battled to win liberty while African slaves were entreated to risk their lives for a freedom they would never claim. The first of two parts, this deeply provocative novel reimagines the past as an eerie place that has startling resonance for readers today.",

    "description": "Kim is set in an imperialistic world; a world strikingly masculine, dominated by travel, trade and adventure, a world in which there is no question of the division between white and non-white.<br /><br />Two men - a boy who grows into early manhood and an old ascetic priest, the lama - are at the center of the novel. A quest faces them both. Born in India, Kim is nevertheless white, a sahib. While he wants to play the Great Game of Imperialism, he is also spiritually bound to the lama. His aim, as he moves chameleon-like through the two cultures, is to reconcile these opposing strands, while the lama searches for redemption from the Wheel of Life. <br /><br />A celebration of their friendship in a beautiful but often hostile environment, 'Kim' captures the opulence of India's exotic landscape, overlaid by the uneasy presence of the British Raj.",

    "description": "Shenzhen is entertainingly compact with Guy Delisle's observations of life in urban southern China, sealed off from the rest of the country by electric fences and armed guards. With a dry wit and a clean line, Delisle makes the most of his time spent in Asia overseeing outsourced production for a French animation company. He brings to life the quick pace of Shenzhen's crowded streets. By translating his fish-out-of-water experiences into accessible graphic novels, Delisle skillfully notes the differences between Western and Eastern cultures, while also conveying his compassion for the simple freedoms that escape his colleagues in the Communist state.",

    "description": "Believing that her French guardian is about to abandon her to an orphanage in the city, ten-year-old Lucky runs away from her small town with her beloved dog by her side in order to trek across the Mojave Desert in this Newbery Medal\u2013winning novel from Susan Patron.<br /><br />Lucky, age ten, can't wait another day. The meanness gland in her heart and the crevices full of questions in her brain make running away from Hard Pan, California (population 43), the rock-bottom only choice she has.<br /><br /> It's all Brigitte's fault -- for wanting to go back to France. Guardians are supposed to stay put and look after girls in their care! Instead Lucky is sure that she'll be abandoned to some orphanage in Los Angeles where her beloved dog, HMS Beagle, won't be allowed. She'll have to lose her friends Miles, who lives on cookies, and Lincoln, future U.S. president (maybe) and member of the International Guild of Knot Tyers. Just as bad, she'll have to give up eavesdropping on twelve-step anonymous programs where the interesting talk is all about Higher Powers. Lucky needs her own -- and quick.<br /><br /> But she hadn't planned on a dust storm.<br /><br /> Or needing to lug the world's heaviest survival-kit backpack into the desert.",

    "description": "Practical, scientific, philosophical, and artistic problems have caused men to investigate mathematics. But there is one other motive which is as strong as any of these \u2014 the search for beauty. Mathematics is an art, and as such affords the pleasures which all the arts afford.\" In this erudite, entertaining college-level text, Morris Kline, Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at New York University, provides the liberal arts student with a detailed treatment of mathematics in a cultural and historical context. The book can also act as a self-study vehicle for advanced high school students and laymen. <br />Professor Kline begins with an overview, tracing the development of mathematics to the ancient Greeks, and following its evolution through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to the present day. Subsequent chapters focus on specific subject areas, such as \"Logic and Mathematics,\" \"Number: The Fundamental Concept,\" \"Parametric Equations and Curvilinear Motion,\" \"The Differential Calculus,\" and \"The Theory of Probability.\" Each of these sections offers a step-by-step explanation of concepts and then tests the student's understanding with exercises and problems. At the same time, these concepts are linked to pure and applied science, engineering, philosophy, the social sciences or even the arts.<br />In one section, Professor Kline discusses non-Euclidean geometry, ranking it with evolution as one of the \"two concepts which have most profoundly revolutionized our intellectual development since the nineteenth century.\" His lucid treatment of this difficult subject starts in the 1800s with the pioneering work of Gauss, Lobachevsky, Bolyai and Riemann, and moves forward to the theory of relativity, explaining the mathematical, scientific and philosophical aspects of this pivotal breakthrough. <i>Mathematics for the Nonmathematician</i> exemplifies Morris Kline's rare ability to simplify complex subjects for the nonspecialist.",

    "description": "A nine-and-a-half-hour documentary on the Nazi extermination camps, <i>Shoah</i> (the Hebrew word for \"Holocaust\") was internationally hailed as a masterpiece upon its release in 1985. Shunning any re-creation, archival footage, or visual documentation of the events, filmmaker Claude Lanzmann relied on the words of witnesses\u2014Jewish, Polish, and German\u2014to describe in ruthless detail the bureaucratic machinery of the Final Solution, so that the remote experiences of the Holocaust became fresh and immediate. This book presents in an accessible and vivid format the testimony of survivors, participants, witnesses, and scholars. This tenth anniversary edition, published on the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation of the camps, is newly revised and corrected in order to more accurately present the actual testimony of those interviewed. <i>Shoah</i> is an unparalleled oral history of the Holocaust, an intensely readable journey through the twentieth century's greatest horror.",
