    "description": "As the application of object technology\u2014particularly the Java programming language\u2014has become commonplace, a new problem has emerged to confront the software development community. Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, non-optimal applications. For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as refactoring, these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use... until now. In <i>Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software</i>, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process.",

Eager to find his origins, Taran sets off with the faithful Gurgi on a quest across the marvelous land of Prydain. Their journey takes them to the three witches in the Marshes of Morva, through the many realms of Prydain, and finally to the mystical Mirror of Llunet, which may hold a truth about Taran's identity that he cannot bear to face. In the course of his travels, Taran will learn much about his world and the good and bad people in it, but will also discover much about himself. <br /><br />After many hard lessons, Taran learns the secret of the Mirror Llunet and of the past--and finds not an ending but a beginning.",

With information both practical (how to find the right running shoes for you, when to enter a race, what to eat before a run) and inspirational (focus on where you are instead of where you want to be, accepting the body you have, the beauty of being realistic about goals), Bingham extends a trusted hand and expert advice to beginners and veterans alike.",

    "description": "A hilarious and poignant novel about an Indian exchange student's year at a small American university<br />-- An engaging look at the clash of Indian culture and an America that is both harsh and exhilarating to a smart but naive foreignerGopal arrives in America from a small town in India prepared for study but decidedly unprepared for the cultural differences he encounters. This delightful novel chronicles the religious, vegetarian Gopal's comic adventures and misadventures in the land of hot dogs, Coca-Cola, neon lights, and explicit advertising.<br /><br />Gopal's frequent frustration with the language and his shocked reaction to certain curious American customs are amusing and pertinent. From his first rude encounter with an alarm clock that sends him ducking for cover to his blushing mishap with his appropriately named American friend Randy, Gopal's experiences prove to be a lesson for all on the often contradictory customs of America and Americans.<br /><br />Through his battles with sometimes subtle racism, his own insecurity, and his family's directive that he will be severely judged should he dabble in America's enticements, Gopal retains a gentle dignity and surprising shrewdness, arousing the affection of friends, colleagues, teachers, and most of all, readers.",

The wild and seductive energy in this collection never lets one put the book down. (In fact, any one who opens the collection in the bookstore and reads such poems as The Conversation and Job Requirements: A Supervillain's Advice will want to buy the book!) For her delivery is heart-breaking and refreshing, so the poems seduce us with the sadness, glory and entertainment of our very own days. Propelled by Jeannine Hall Gailey's alert, sensuous, and musical gifts, the mythology becomes all our own.\" -Ilya Kaminsky, author of the award-winning Dancing in Odessa",

    "description": "\"When I was little I would think of ways to kill my daddy. I would figure out this or that way and run it down through my head until it got easy.\" So begins the tale of Ellen Foster, the brave and engaging heroine of Kay Gibbons's first novel, which won the Sue Kaufman Prize from the American Academy of Institute of Arts and Letters. Wise, funny, affectionate, and true, Ellen Foster is, as Walker Percy called it, \"The real thing. Which is to say, a lovely, sometimes heartwrenching novel. . . . [Ellen Foster] is as much a part of the backwoods South as a Faulkner character\u2014and a good deal more endearing.\"",

    "description": "An explosive first-person account by a young woman who spent fifteen years in a sex cult called the Children of God, which encouraged \"sacred prostitution\" and taught that \"The Lord is our pimp.\"Miriam Williams was an idealistic child of the sixties who, at seventeen, accepted an invitation from a \"Jesus person\" to visit a commune in upstate New York. She would soon be prostituting herself for a perverse cult that used sex to lure sinners to the Lord -- and this is her shocking, searingly honest account of a fifteen-year spiritual odyssey gone haywire.<br /><br />The Children of God turned its female devotees into Heaven's Harlots, leading strangers to the love of God by enticing them with the pleasures of the flesh. At its height, the cult boasted 19,000 members around the world: In such places as France and Monte Carlo, young women, Miriam among them, mingled with the rich and famous to save their souls, and in this unsparing, unnerving autobiography, she'll identify some of her high-profile \"clients.\" She left this bizarre world in an attempt to protect her son, born through an arranged marriage and kidnapped by his father.<br /><br />Now, in a clear, compelling, cautionary tale, she shares both her extraordinary existence as a holy whore and the daunting experience of rebuilding a normal life -- an ordeal that led her to found a group dedicated to helping other cult survivors reclaim their souls as well.",

    "description": "The collapse of the Soviet Union has opened up a huge consumer market, but how do you sell things to a generation that grew up with just one type of cola? When Tatarsky, a frustrated poet, takes a job as an advertising copywriter, he finds he has a talent for putting distinctively Russian twists on Western-style ads. But his success leads him into a surreal world of spin doctors, gangsters, drug trips, and the spirit of Che Guevera, who, by way of a Ouija board, communicates theories of consumer theology. A bestseller in Russia, <b>Homo Zapiens</b> displays the biting absurdist satire that has gained Victor Pelevin superstar status among today's Russian youth, disapproval from the conservative Moscow literary world, and critical acclaim worldwide.",

A freak among people who can regenerate injured flesh... and trade extra body parts to the Offworld oppressors for iron. For, on a planet without hard metals -- or the means of escape -- iron is power in the race to build a spacecraft. <br />Iron is the promise of freedom -- which may never be fulfilled as Lanik uncovers a treacherous conspiracy beyond his imagination. <br />Now charged with a mission of conquest -- and exile -- Lanik devises a bold and dangerous plan... a quest that may finally break the vicious chain of rivalry and bloodshed that enslaves the people of Treason as the Offworld never could.",

In this first novel, his slacker kids ponder life's mundane questions with the seriousness of ancient philosophers: how to get by on no money, where to scam free photocopies, and the finer points of food filching. Through a haze of beer and Top Ramen, they engage in endless debates about the nature of punk rock rage. the tribe of punks and dropouts has never before been so perfectly chronicled as in this oral history made into a written saga. In his autobiographical work, Cometbus offers an eclectic series of connected stories about living on the fringe in Berkeley.",

    "description": "The Stars Down to Earth shows us a stunningly prescient Adorno. Haunted by the ugly side of American culture industries he used the different angles provided by each of these three essays to showcase the dangers inherent in modern obsessions with consumption. He engages with some of his most enduring themes in this seminal collection, focussing on the irrational in mass culture - from astrology to new age cults, from anti-semitism to the power of neo-fascist propaganda. He points out that the modern state and market forces serve the interest of capital in its basic form. Stephan Crook's introduction grounds Adorno's arguments firmly in the present where extreme religious and political organizations are commonplace - so commonplace in fact that often we deem them unworthy of our attention. Half a century ago Theodore Adorno not only recognised the dangers, but proclaimed them loudly. We did not listen then. Maybe it is not too late to listen now.",

In this precarious new era, three young women prepare themselves to head off to university and explore the world beyond Yorkshire, England. The bookish Hetty Fallowes struggles to become independent of her overbearing mother, Una Vane embarks on a bicycle trip around the countryside with a young man from the wrong side of the tracks, and Liselotte Klein, a Jewish refugee taken in by a Quaker family, heads to London in search of her only relatives to survive the Nazis.<br /><br />As the three struggle to find meaning and love in a new world, they realize that they still have much to learn, and that their friendship is perhaps the only constant in an ever-changing world.",

    "description": "Problem-Solving Strategies is a unique collection of competition problems from over twenty major national and international mathematical competitions for high school students. The discussion of problem solving strategies is extensive. It is written for trainers and participants of contests of all levels up to the highest level: IMO, Tournament of the Towns, and the noncalculus parts of the Putnam Competition. It will appeal to high school teachers conducting a mathematics club who need a range of simple to complex problems and to those instructors wishing to pose a \"problem of the week,\" \"problem of the month,\" and \"research problem of the year\" to their students, thus bringing a creative atmosphere into their classrooms with continuous discussions of mathematical problems. This volume is a must-have for instructors wishing to enrich their teaching with some interesting non-routine problems and for individuals who are just interested in solving difficult and challenging problems. Each chapter starts with typical examples illustrating the central concepts and is followed by a number of carefully selected problems and their solutions. Most of the solutions are complete, but some merely point to the road leading to the final solution. Very few problems have no solutions. Readers interested in increasing the effectiveness of the book can do so by working on the examples in addition to the problems thereby increasing the number of problems to over 1300. In addition to being a valuable resource of mathematical problems and solution strategies, this volume is the most complete training book on the market.",

    "description": "In this, one of the most influential works of the post-Hegelian era, Feuerbach captures the synthesis that emerges from the dialectical process of a transcending Godhead &amp; the rational &amp; material world. In understanding the true nature of what it means to be fully human, he contends that we come face to face with the essence of Xian theology: human beings investing ordinary concepts with divine meaning &amp; significance. The true danger to humanity occurs when theology is given the force of dogma &amp; doctrine. Losing sight of its anthropological underpinnings &amp; dependence upon or emergence from human nature, it then acquires an existence separate from that of humankind. He leaves nothing untouched: miracles, the Trinity, Creation, prayer, resurrection, immortality, faith &amp; much more.<br />The essential nature of man<br />The essence of religion considered generally<br />God as a being of the understanding <br />God as a moral being or law <br />The mystery of the incarnation; or, God as love, as a being of the heart<br />The mystery of the suffering God<br />The mystery of the Trinity &amp; the mother of God<br />The mystery of the Logos &amp; divine image<br />The mystery of the cosmogonical principle in God <br />The mystery of mysticism, or of nature in God <br />The mystery of providence &amp; creation out of nothing<br />The significance of the creation in Judaism <br />The omnipotence of feeling, or the mystery of prayer <br />The mystery of faith, the mystery of miracle <br />The mystery of the resurrection and of the miraculous conception<br />The mystery of the Christian Christ, or the personal God<br />The distinction between Christianity &amp; heathenism<br />The significance of voluntary celibacy &amp; monachism<br />The Christian heaven, or personal immortality <br />The essential standpoint of religion <br />The contradiction in the existence of God<br />The contradiction in the revelation of God<br />The contradiction in the nature of God in general<br />The contradiction in the speculative doctrine of God<br />The contradiction in the Trinity <br />The contradiction in the sacraments<br />The contradiction of faith &amp; love<br />Concluding application",

    "description": "Friedrich Nietzsche's <i>Beyond Good and Evil </i>is translated from the German by R.J. Hollingdale with an introduction by Michael Tanner in Penguin Classics.<br /><br /><i>Beyond Good and Evil</i> confirmed Nietzsche's position as the towering European philosopher of his age. The work dramatically rejects the tradition of Western thought with its notions of truth and God, good and evil. Nietzsche demonstrates that the Christian world is steeped in a false piety and infected with a 'slave morality'. With wit and energy, he turns from this critique to a philosophy that celebrates the present and demands that the individual imposes their own 'will to power' upon the world.<br /><br />This edition includes a commentary on the text by the translator and Michael Tanner's introduction, which explains some of the more abstract passages in <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i>.<br /><br />Frederich Nietzsche (1844-1900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. A powerfully original thinker, Nietzsche's influence on subsequent writers, such as George Bernard Shaw, D.H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann and Jean-Paul Sartre, was considerable.<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>Beyond Good and Evil </i>you might like Nietzsche's <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>, also available in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />\"One of the greatest books of a very great thinker.\" \u2014Michael Tanner",

Though they span the career of this controversial genius, both address the problems such as the conflict between the moral versus aesthetic approaches to life, the effect of Christianity on human values, the meaning of science, and the famous dichotomy between the Apollonian and Dionysian spirits, among many themes which Nietzsche struggled throughout his tortured life.",

    "description": "Organizing data from cultures the world over, Eliade lays out the basic patterns of initiation: group puberty rites, entrance into secret cults, shamanic instruction, individual visions, and heroic rites of passage. The vast information, assembled so beautifully, transcends usual scholarship. Eliade always affirms the greater experience in all initiations - the indissoluble tie between humans and the cosmos of Gods, spirits, animals ancestors, and nature. The absence of initiation in our culture has left modern men and women often isolated from each other, from the invisible powers beyond, and from the myths that sustain daily life. The primal soul desire for symbolic rituals pushes youth into substitutes for initiatory experience: gangs, suicide, car crashes, teenage pregnancy, street drugs. These \"symptoms\" show the unquenchable urge for existential transformation and the need for elders, mentors, and rituals. This book is about crossing - from confusion to knowledge, from innocence to experienced elder.",

As much as anyone in the modern era, he changed human thought, and his influence is still felt in virtually all aspects of our lives. This new edition, larger and more varied than the previous ones, includes more of Darwin's own work and also presents the most recent research and scholarship on all aspects of Darwin\u2019s legacy. The biological sciences, as well as social thought, philosophy, ethics, religion, and literature, have all been shaped and reshaped by evolutionary concepts.<br /><br />Excerpts from the most important books and articles of recent years confirm this Darwinian heritage. New work by Richard Dawkins, Edward O. Wilson, Kevin Padian, Eugene C. Scott, Steven Pinker, Daniel Dennett, Michael Ruse, Frans de Waal, Noretta Koertge, George C. Williams, George Levine, Stephen Jay Gould, Gillian Beer, Ernst Mayr, and many others illuminates this exciting intellectual history. A wide-ranging new introduction by the editor provides context and coherence to this rich body of engaging material, much of which will be shaping human thought well into the new century.<br /><br />This collection of Darwin's writing, those of his critics and those of his intellectual descendants, includes:<br />- The Voyage of the Beagle (1845): Ch. I, XVII<br />- On the Tendency of Species to Form Varieties; And on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection (1858): Ch. I-II<br />- An Historical Sketch of the Progress of Opinion on the Origin of Species Previously to the Publication of this Work (1861) The Origin of Species (1859): Introduction, Ch. I-IV, VI, IX, XIII-XIV<br />- The Descent of Man (1871): Introduction, Ch. I-III, VI, VIII, XIX-XXI",

But Lythe was once the heart of an Elizabethan feudal estate and home to a young English tutor named William Shakespeare, and as Isobel investigates the strange history of her family, her neighbors, and her village, she occasionally gets caught in Shakespearean time warps. Meanwhile, she gets closer to the shocking truths about her missing mother, her war-hero father, and the hidden lives of her close friends and classmates. A stunning feat of imagination and storytelling, Kate Atkinson's <i>Human Croquet </i>is rich with the disappointments and possibilities every family shares.",

    "description": "In downtown Manhattan, a gruesome discovery has just been made-an underground charnel house containing the bones of dozens of murder victims. Research reveals that a serial killer was at work in New York's notorious Five Points neighborhood in the 1880s, bent on prolonging his lifespan by any means. When a newspaper story on the old murders appears to ignite a new series of horrifyingly similar killings, panic overtakes New York City. Now, FBI agent Pendergast, journalist Bill Smithback, and archaeologist Nora Kelly join forces to protect themselves from a vicious killer...before they become the next victims.",

Diogenes, the psychotic killer who stole them in Dance of Death, is throwing down the gauntlet to both the city and to his brother, FBI Agent Pendergast, who is currently incarcerated in a maximum security prison.<br /><br />To quell the PR nightmare of the gem fiasco, the museum decides to reopen the Tomb of Senef. An astounding Egyptian temple, it was a popular museum exhibit until the 1930s, when it was quietly closed. But when the tomb is unsealed in preparation for its gala reopening, the killings--and whispers of an ancient curse--begin again. And the catastrophic opening itself sets the stage for the final battle between the two brothers: an epic clash from which only one will emerge alive.",

    "description": "Two brothers on opposite sides of the law battle it out on the streets of New York in this chill-inducing thriller, a follow-up to BRIMSTONE. \u2014 As the previous installment came to a close, vicious dogs and armed men surrounded FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast and his demise seemed certain. Nevertheless, he did leave behind a legacy: a letter for his friend, NYPD Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta. Its contents ask D'Agosta to assume the responsibility of pursuing Pendergast's younger brother Diogenes, an insane and vengeful genius who has sworn to commit the perfect crime on January 28 -- which is now only one week away.",

Those orthodoxies, he believes, have a chilling effect on our capacity to think independently and to become active citizens in the long struggle for peace and justice.",

A small child when he comes to England on a Kindertransport in the summer of 1939, one Jacques Austerlitz is told nothing of his real family by the Welsh Methodist minister and his wife who raise him. When he is a much older man, the fleeting memories return to him, and obeying an instinct he only dimly understands, he follows their trail back to the world he left behind a half century before. There, faced with the void at the heart of twentieth-century Europe, he struggles to rescue his heritage from oblivion.",

    "description": "Hailed by Nabokov as \"the greatest artist that Russia has yet produced,\" Nikolai Gogol (1809-1852) left his mark as a playwright, novelist, and writer of short stories. Gogol's works remain popular with both writers and readers, who prize his originality, imaginative gifts, and sheer exuberance.<br />This collection offers an excellent introduction to the author's works. Opening a door to his bizarre world of broad comedy, fantasy, and social commentary, the title story portrays a petty official's mental disintegration as he struggles for the attention of the woman he loves. Set during the repressive rule of Nicholas I, it satirizes the bureaucratic excesses of the era. Additional tales include \"The Nevski Prospect,\" a portrayal of the feverish pace of St. Petersburg street life, and \"The Portrait,\" a gripping depiction of a soul's perdition.",

    "description": "In this luminous portrait of Paris, celebrated historian Alistair Horne gives us the history, culture, disasters, and triumphs of one of the world\u2019s truly great cities. Horne makes plain that while Paris may be many things, it is never boring.<br /><br />From the rise of Philippe Auguste through the reigns of Henry IV and Louis XIV (who abandoned Paris for Versailles); Napoleon\u2019s rise and fall; Baron Haussmann\u2019s rebuilding of Paris (at the cost of much of the medieval city); the Belle Epoque and the Great War that brought it to an end; the Nazi Occupation, the Liberation, and the postwar period dominated by de Gaulle--Horne brings the city\u2019s highs and lows, savagery and sophistication, and heroes and villains splendidly to life. With a keen eye for the telling anecdote and pivotal moment, he portrays an array of vivid incidents to show us how Paris endures through each age, is altered but always emerges more brilliant and beautiful than ever. <b>The Seven Ages of Paris</b> is a great historian\u2019s tribute to a city he loves and has spent a lifetime learning to know.",

    "description": "<b>The exciting conclusion to the<i> Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman</i> trilogy recounts the climactic events of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> from its enigmatic hero's point of view.</b> <p> </p><p> One of the most beloved romantic heroes in all of literature, Fitzwilliam Darcy remains an enigma even to Jane Austen's most devoted fans. No longer. With this concluding volume in the <i>Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman</i> trilogy, novelist and Austen aficionada Pamela Aidan at last gives readers the man in full. </p><p> <i>These Three Remain</i> follows a humbled Darcy on the journey of self-discovery, after Elizabeth Bennet's rejection of his marriage proposal, in which he endeavors to grow into the kind of gentleman he desires to become. Happily, a chance meeting with Elizabeth during a tour of his estate in Derbyshire offers Darcy a new opportunity to press his suit, but his newfound strengths are put to the test by an old nemesis, George Wickham. </p><p> Vividly capturing the colorful historical and political milieu of the Regency era, Aidan writes in a style evocative of her literary progenitor, but with a wit and humor very much her own. While staying faithful to the people and events in Austen's original, she adds her own fascinating cast of characters, weaving a rich tapestry out of Darcy's past and present that will beguile his admirers anew.</p>",

Jane Austen called this brilliant work \"her own darling child\" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, \"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print.\" The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.",

    "description": "Evolving from the premise that customers have always behaved more like cats than Pavlov's dogs, <em>Waiting for Your Cat to Bark?</em> examines how emerging media have undermined the effectiveness of prevailing mass marketing models. At the same time, emerging media have created an unprecedented opportunity for businesses to redefine how they communicate with customers by leveraging the power of increasingly interconnected media channels.<br /><br /><br />Bryan and Jeffrey Eisenberg don't simply explain this shift in paradigm; <em>Waiting for Your Cat to Bark? </em>introduces Persuasion Architecture\u2122 as the synthetic model that provides business with a proven context for rethinking customers and retooling marketers in a rewired market.<br /><br /><br />Readers will learn:<br /><br /><br /><br />Why many marketers are unprepared for today's increasingly fragmented, in-control, always-on audience that makes pin-point relevance mandatory<br />How interactivity has changed the nature of marketing by extending its reach into the world of sales, design, merchandizing, and customer relations<br />How Persuasion Architecture\u2122 allows businesses to create powerful, multi-channel persuasive systems that anticipate customer needs<br />How Persuasion Architecture\u2122 allows businesses to measure and optimize the return on investment for every discreet piece of that persuasive system<br />\"There's some big thinking going on here-thinking you will need if you want to take your work to the next level. 'Typical, not average' is just one of the ideas inside that will change the way you think about marketing.\" ?<strong>Seth Godin</strong>, Author, <em>All Marketers Are Liars</em><br /><br /><br />\"Are your clients coming to you armed with more product information than you or your sales team know? You need to read <em>Waiting for Your Cat to Bark?</em> to learn how people are buying in the post-Internet age so you can learn how to sell to them.\" ?<strong>Tom Hopkins</strong>, Master Sales Trainer and Author, <em>How to Master the Art of Selling</em><br /><br /><br />\"These guys really 'get it.' In a world of know-it-all marketing hypesters, these guys realize that it takes work to persuade people who aren't listening. They've connected a lot of the pieces that we all already know-plus a lot that we don't. It's a rare approach that recognizes that the customer is in charge and must be encouraged and engaged on his/her own terms, not the sellers. <em>Waiting for Your Cat to Bark?</em> takes apart the persuasion process, breaks down the steps and gives practical ways to tailor your approaches to your varying real customers in the real world. This book is at a high level that marketers better hope their competitors will be too lazy to implement.\" ?<strong>George Silverman</strong>, Author, <em>The Secrets of Word of Mouth Marketing: How to Trigger Exponential Sales Through Runaway Word of Mouth</em><br /><br /><br />\"We often hear that the current marketing model is broken-meaning the changes in customers, media, distribution, and even the flatness of the world make current practices no longer relevant. Yet few have offered a solution. This book recognizes the new reality in which we operate and provides a path for moving forward. The authors do an outstanding job of using metaphors to help make Persuasion Architecture clear and real-life examples to make it come alive. Finally, someone has offered direction for how to market in this new era where the customer is in control.\" ?<strong>David J. Reibstein</strong>, William Stewart Woodside Professor, Wharton Business School of the University of Pennsylvania and former Executive Director, Marketing Science Institute<br /><br /><br />\"If you want to learn persistence, get a cat. If you want to learn marketing, get this book. It's purrfect.\" ?<strong>Jeffrey Gitomer</strong>, Author, <em>The Little Red Book of Selling</em>",

    "description": "\"Housing the world's collective knowledge, within which reside the milestones of human intellectual achievement, libraries are perhaps the richest of all cultural institutions. Often architectural treasures in themselves, they were constructed in styles that befitted the riches they stored, from Neoclassical temples to Baroque palaces to Jeffersonian athaeneums. Both public in purpose and intensely private in feel, they have served the noble role of preserving and disseminating that key cultural artifact of mankind - the book - and in doing so, their role has been central to the nourishment and development of the world's great civilizations. To this day the great libraries of the world remain extraordinary environments for scholarship and enlightenment.\" \"Here, for the first time, architectural photographer Guillaume de Laubier takes the reader on a privileged tour of twenty-three of the world's most historic libraries, representing twelve countries and ranging from the great national monuments to scholarly, religious, and private libraries: the baroque splendor of the Institut de France in Paris; the Renaissance treasure-trove of the Riccardiana Library in Florence; the majestic Royal Monastery in El Escorial, Spain; the hallowed halls of Oxford's Bodleian Library; and the New York Public Library, a Beaux-Arts masterpiece. Also included are the smaller abbey and monastic libraries - often overlooked on tourist itineraries - each containing its own equally important collections of religious and philosophical writings, manuscripts, and church history. Through color photography one can marvel at the grandeur of the great public libraries while relishing the rare glimpses inside scholars-only private archives.\" The accompanying text by journalist and translator Jacques Bosser traces the history of libraries from the Renaissance to the present day, vividly describing how they came to serve the famous men of letters of centuries past and the general public of the ni",

    "description": "Working in his garden one day, Michael Pollan hit pay dirt in the form of an idea: do plants, he wondered, use humans as much as we use them? While the question is not entirely original, the way Pollan examines this complex coevolution by looking at the natural world from the perspective of plants is unique. The result is a fascinating and engaging look at the true nature of domestication.<p> In making his point, Pollan focuses on the relationship between humans and four specific plants: apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes. He uses the history of John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) to illustrate how both the apple's sweetness and its role in the production of alcoholic cider made it appealing to settlers moving west, thus greatly expanding the plant's range. He also explains how human manipulation of the plant has weakened it, so that \"modern apples require more pesticide than any other food crop.\" The tulipomania of 17th-century Holland is a backdrop for his examination of the role the tulip's beauty played in wildly influencing human behavior to both the benefit and detriment of the plant (the markings that made the tulip so attractive to the Dutch were actually caused by a virus). His excellent discussion of the potato combines a history of the plant with a prime example of how biotechnology is changing our relationship to nature. As part of his research, Pollan visited the Monsanto company headquarters and planted some of their NewLeaf brand potatoes in his garden--seeds that had been genetically engineered to produce their own insecticide. Though they worked as advertised, he made some startling discoveries, primarily that the NewLeaf plants themselves are registered as a pesticide by the EPA and that federal law prohibits anyone from reaping more than one crop per seed packet. And in a interesting aside, he explains how a global desire for consistently perfect French fries contributes to both damaging monoculture and the genetic engineering necessary to support it.</p><p> Pollan has read widely on the subject and elegantly combines literary, historical, philosophical, and scientific references with engaging anecdotes, giving readers much to ponder while weeding their gardens. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>",

    "description": "Susan Choi's first novel, <i>The Foreign Student</i>, was published to remarkable critical acclaim. <i>The New Yorker</i> called it \"an auspicious debut,\" and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> touted it as \"a novel of extraordinary sensibility and transforming strangeness,\" naming it one of the ten best books of the year. <i>American Woman</i>, this gifted writer's second book, is a novel of even greater scope and dramatic complexity, about a young Japanese-American radical caught in the militant underground of the mid-1970s.<br /><br />When 25-year-old Jenny Shimada steps out of the Rhinecliff train station in New York's Hudson Valley, the last person she expects to see is Rob Frazer, a shadowy figure from her previous life. On the lam for an act of violence against the American government, Jenny agrees to take on the job of caring for three younger fugitives whom Frazer has spirited out of California. One of them, the granddaughter of a wealthy newspaper magnate in San Francisco, has become a national celebrity. Kidnapped by a homegrown revolutionary group, Pauline shocked America when she embraced her captors' ideology, denouncing family and class to enlist in their radical cell.<br /><br /><i>American Woman</i> unfolds the story of Jenny and her charges -- Pauline, Juan, and Yvonne, the remains of the busted revolutionary cadre -- as they pursue their destinies from an old farmhouse in upstate New York back to California. Provocative, suspenseful, and often wickedly comic, the novel explores the psychology of the young radicals -- outsiders all -- as isolation and paranoia inevitably undermine their ideals. <i>American Woman</i> is a tour de force with chilling resonance for readers today.",

    "description": "With House Of Glass comes the final chapter of Pramoedya's epic quartet, set in the Dutch East Indies at the turn of the century. A novel of heroism, passion, and betrayal, it provides a spectacular conclusion to a series hailed as one of the great works of modern literature. At the start of House of Glass, Minke, writer and leader of the dissident movement, is now imprisoned - and the narrative has switched to Pangemanann, a former policeman, who has the task of spying and reporting on those who continue the struggle for independence. But the hunter is becoming the hunted. Pangemanann is a victim of his own conscience and has come to admire his adversaries. He must decide whether the law is to safeguard the rights of the people or to control the people. He fears the loss of his position, his family, and his self-respect. At last Pangemanann sees that his true opponents are not Minke and his followers, but rather the dynamism and energy of a society awakened.",

    "description": "In Child of All Nations, the reader is immediately swept up by a story that is profoundly feminist, devastatingly anticolonialist\u2014and full of heartbreak, suspense, love, and fury. Pramoedya immerses the reader in a world that is astonishing in its vividness: the cultural whirlpool that was the Dutch East Indies of the 1890s. A story of awakening, it follows Minke, the main character of This Earth of Mankind, as he struggles to overcome the injustice all around him. Pramoedya\u2019s full literary genius is evident in the brilliant characters that populate this world: Minke\u2019s fragile Mixed-Race wife; a young Chinese revolutionary; an embattled Javanese peasant and his impoverished family; the French painter Jean Marais, to name just a few.",

    "description": "This \"richly appointed and generously portrayed\" (Kirkus Reviews) debut novel tells the story of a WASPy, old-Boston family coming face to face with an America much larger than the one it was born in. Caroline Dunlap has written off the insular world of the Boston deb parties, golf club luaus, and WASP weddings that she grew up with. But when she reluctantly returns home after her college graduation, she finds that not everything is quite as predictable, or protected, as she had imagined. Her father, the eccentric, puritanical Jack Dunlap, is carrying on stoically after the breakup of his marriage, but he can't stop thinking of Rosita, the family housekeeper he fired almost six months ago. Caroline's little brother, Eliot, is working on a giant papier-m\ufffdche diorama of their town-or is he hatching a plan of larger proportions? As the real reason for Rosita's departure is revealed, the novel culminates in a series of events that assault the fragile, sheltered, and arguably obsolete world of the Dunlaps. Opening a window into a family's repressed desires and fears, The Hazards of Good Breeding is a startlingly perceptive comedy of manners that heralds a new writer of dazzling talent.",

    "description": "Naomi Klein's \u2018No Logo\u2019 told us what was wrong. Now, George Monbiot shows us how to put it right. Provocative, brave and beautifully argued, \u2018The Age of Consent\u2019 is nothing less than a manifesto for a new world order.<br /><br /><br />\u2018Our task is not to overthrow globalisation, but to capture it, and to use it as a vehicle for humanity's first global democratic revolution.\u2019<br /><br /><br />All over our planet, the rich get richer while the poor are overtaken by debt and disaster. The world is run not by its people but by a handful of unelected or underelected executives who make the decisions on which everyone else depends: concerning war, peace, debt, development and the balance of trade. Without democracy at the global level, the rest of us are left with no means of influencing these men but to shout abuse and hurl ourselves at the lines of police defending their gatherings and decisions. Does it have to be this way?<br /><br /><br />George Monbiot knows not only that things ought to change, but also that they can change. Drawing on decades of thinking about how the world is organized and administered politically, fiscally and commercially, Monbiot has developed an interlocking set of proposals all his own, which attempts nothing less than a revolution in the way the world is run. If these proposals become popular, never again will people be able to ask of the critics of the existing world order, \u2018we know what they don't want, but what do they want?\u2019<br /><br /><br />Fiercely controversial and yet utterly persuasive, the ingenious solutions Monbiot suggests for some of the planet's most pressing problems mark him as perhaps the most realistic utopian of our time and a man whose passion is infectious and whose ideas, many will surely come to agree, are becoming irresistible.",

    "description": "Winner of the Pulitzer prize in 1974 and the culmination of a life's work, <i>The Denial of Death</i> is Ernest Becker's brilliant and impassioned answer to the \"why\" of human existence. In bold contrast to the predominant Freudian school of thought, Becker tackles the problem of the vital lie -- man's refusal to acknowledge his own mortality. In doing so, he sheds new light on the nature of humanity and issues a call to life and its living that still resonates more than twenty years after its writing.",

    "description": "From debut author Ronlyn Domingue comes a stunning, imaginative novel that beautifully captures the nature of love and how it transcends all barriers -- even death.In 1920s New Orleans, smart and fearless Raziela Nolan is in the throes of a magnificent love affair when she suddenly dies in a tragic accident. Immediately after her death, she chooses to stay between -- a realm that exists after life and before whatever lies beyond it. From this remarkable vantage point, Razi narrates the story of her lost love, as well as the relationship of Amy and Scott, a young couple whose house she haunts seventy years later. Their trials finally compel Razi to slowly unravel the mystery of what happened to her first and only love and to confront a long-hidden secret.<br /><br />\"The Mercy of Thin Air\" entwines love stories that echo across three generations culminating in a startling finish that will leave listeners breathless.",

    "description": "Song of the Battle and Kings<br /><br /><i>Beowulf</i> is the earliest extant poem in a modern European language. It was composed in England four centuries before the Norman Conquest. As a social document this great epic poem is invaluable- reflecting a feudal, newly Christian world of heroes and monsters, blood and victory, life and death. As a work of art it is quite unique; <i>Beowulf</i> rings with a beaut, power, and artistry that have kept it alive for more than twelve centuries. The noble simplicity of <i>Beowulf</i>'s anonymous Anglo-Saxon singer is recaptured in this vivid translation by Burton Raffel.",

    "description": "Of the two hundred stories that Anton Chekhov wrote, the twenty stories that appear in this extraordinary collection were personally chosen by Richard Ford--an accomplished storyteller in his own right. Included are the familiar masterpieces--\"The Kiss,\" \"The Darling,\" and \"The Lady with the Dog\"--as well as several brilliant lesser-known tales such as \"A Blunder,\" \"Hush!,\" and \"Champagne.\" These stories, ordered from 1886 to 1899, are drawn from Chekhov's most fruitful years as a short-story writer. A truly balanced selection, they exhibit the qualities that make Chekhov one of the greatest fiction writers of all time: his gift for detail, dialogue, and humor; his emotional perception and compassion; and his understanding that life's most important moments are often the most overlooked.<br /><br />\"The reason we like Chekhov so much, now at our century's end,\" writes Ford in his perceptive introduction, \"is because his stories from the last century's end feel so modern to us, are so much of our own time and mind.\" Exquisitely translated by the renowned Constance Garnett, these stories present a wonderful opportunity to introduce yourself--or become reaquainted with--an artist whose genius and influence only increase with every passing generation.",

As yet I have no name.</b><br /><br />So begins one of the most original and unforgettable works in Japanese literature.<br /><br />Richly allegorical and delightfully readable, <i>I Am a Cat</i> is the chronicle of an unloved, unwanted, wandering kitten who spends all his time observing human nature - from the dramas of businessmen and schoolteachers to the foibles of priests and potentates. From this unique perfective, author S\u014dseki Natsume offers a biting commentary - shaped by his training in Chinese philosophy - on the social upheaval of the Meiji era.<br /><br /><i>I Am a Cat</i> first appeared in ten installments in the literary magazine <i>Hotoguisu (Cuckoo)</i>, between 1905 and 1906. S\u014dseki had not intended to write more than the short story that makes up the first chapter of this book. After its great critical and popular success, he expanded it into this epic novel, which is universally recognised as a classic of world literature.<br /><br />&lt;&gt;A well-loved work by a Japanese writer of genius - <i>Japan Quarterly</i>",

    "description": "Mick Foley is a nice man, a family man who loves amusement parks and eating ice cream in bed. So how to explain those Japanese death matches in rings with explosives, golden thumbtacks and barbed wire instead of rope? The second-degree burn tissue? And the missing ear that was ripped off during a bout-in which he kept fighting? Here is an intimate glimpse into Mick Foley's mind, his history, his work and what some might call his pathology. Now with a bonus chapter summarizing the past 15 months-from his experience as a bestselling author through his parting thoughts before his final match. A tale of blood, sweat, tears and more blood-all in his own words-straight from the twisted genius behind Cactus Jack, Dude Love, and Mankind.",

    "description": "From the award-winning avatar of contemporary urban theater and author of such modern classics as <i>Talk Radio</i> and <i>subUrbia</i> comes this outrageous novel about five suburbanites whose lives intersect in one violent and life-altering night -- at the local mall. <br /> Mal, a thirtysomething speed freak, shoots his mother, torches his house, and heads to the local mall with a sack of weapons and a plan for more mayhem. Danny, a voyeuristic businessman with a fetish for young underwear models, is caught by mall security peeking into dressing rooms at JCPenney. Jeff, a teenager with existential troubles, drops acid and departs on a philosophical nightmare. Donna, a hungry, unsettled housewife, is on the lookout for a one-night stand. Michel, a Haitian immigrant and mall security guard, seeks salvation. All long for a kind of satisfaction, and this longing leads them to the modern plaza of possibility, the shopping mall, where their appetites converge in explosive ways. <br /> Satirical and provocative, Mall is an eye-opening look at suburban life and the idea of \"normalcy.\" In this, his first novel, Eric Bogosian delivers a dark, hilarious, and biting commentary on an American culture fraught with sex, drugs, violence, and congested thinking.",

Thirty long years dedicated to putting the past the brutal murder of his girlfriend, Alison Taylor, and his own acquittal of the crime behind him. Married, a father, and a successful defense lawyer in San Francisco, Tony Lord has run as far from Lake City as he can.<br /><br />But the phone call requesting his return and the circumstances surrounding it is enough to make the ghosts of Tony's past live again. The trigger is the murder of another young woman - that of 16-year-old Lake City High School track star Marcie Calder, last seen alive with Sam Robb, her coach and Tony's childhood friend.<br /><br />With this stunning new novel of psychological drama and suspense, <i>Richard North Patterson</i> has done it again. <i>Silent Witness</i> is a drama of rivalry and betrayal, the darkest recesses of love and friendship, and the tenacious grip of the past on all our lives.",

    "description": "Throughout history, some books have changed the world. They have transformed the way we see ourselves\u2014and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives\u2014and destroyed them.<br /><br />Published anonymously in 1776, six months before the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Paine\u2019s Common Sense was a radical and impassioned call for America to free itself from British rule and set up an independent republican government. <br />Savagely attacking hereditary kingship and aristocratic institutions, Paine urged a new beginning for his adopted country in which personal freedom and social equality would be upheld and economic and cultural progress encouraged.\u00a0 <br /><br />His pamphlet was the first to speak directly to a mass audience\u2014it went through fifty-six editions within a year of publication\u2014and its assertive and often caustic style both embodied the democratic spirit he advocated, and converted thousands of citizens to the cause of American independence.",

    "description": "Sasha Goldberg is the ultimate outsider: she's a chubby, biracial Jewish girl from the Siberian town of Asbestos 2. Her father takes off for the United States, and leaves Sasha to navigate adolescence in a bleak apartment bloc with her overbearing mother. Sasha falls in love with an art school drop-out who lives inside a concrete pipe in the town dump. Following her heart gets her into trouble at home, so she flees Russia as a mail-order bride and lands in suburban Arizona. Sasha manages to escape her Red Lobster-loving fianc\u00e9 and embarks on a misadventure-filled journey across America in search of her father. <p> Anya Ulinich has crafted an unforgettable story of familial fault lines, cross-cultural confusion, and the beguiling allure of new beginnings. <i>Petropolis</i> is a funny and poignant debut marking the arrival of a major new voice in fiction.</p>",

Now it's time to return the favor and put the would-be conqueror on notice that the cost of subjugating this last stronghold of magic will be higher than he can bear. The one Fable who can accomplish this mission, however, has hidden himself away in the wild and will take some convincing if he can even be found. Luckily for Fabletown, there's something more than a trip behind enemy lines awaiting Bigby Wolf's return...<br /><br /><b>Collecting</b>: <i>Fables</i> 48-51",

In post-AIDS 1986, B.J.'s world has changed dramatically -- his friends and lovers are getting sick, everyone is at risk, and B.J. is panicking. Parrying high-wire wit against unbearable human tragedy, Eighty-Sixed now stands as a testament to an era. \"If Woody Allen were gay and wrote novels, he'd produce something like David Feinberg's Eighty-Sixed.\" -- David Streitfeld, The Washington Post Book World \"[Feinberg] has given us a painful story of one man coming of age in a terrifying age.\" -- The Plain Dealer (Cleveland) \"Entertaining, harrowing, and powerfully unsensational.\" -- Booklist \"[Eighty-Sixed] stands out for its frankness, ferocious wit, and total lack of sentimentality or self pity.\" -- Catherine Texier, The New York Times Book Review",

    "description": "Set immediately prior to the trial and execution of Socrates in 399 BC, Theaetetus shows the great philosopher considering the nature of knowledge itself, in a debate with the geometrician Theodorus and his young follower Theaetetus. Their dialogue covers many questions, such as: is knowledge purely subjective, composed of the ever-changing flow of impressions we receive from the outside world? Is it better thought of as 'true belief'? Or is it, as many modern philosophers argue, 'justified true belief', in which the belief is supported by argument or evidence? With skill and eloquence, Socrates guides the debate, drawing out the implications of these theories and subjecting them to merciless and mesmerising criticism. One of the founding works of epistemology, this profound discussion of the problem of knowledge continues to intrigue and inspire.",

    "description": "If you've ever been fired, you're in good company. That's what actress and writer Annabelle Gurwitch discovered when she was fired by her idol Woody Allen (\"You look retarded\"). She confided her tale of woe to her friend Felicity Huffman, who made Annabelle laugh with her own stories. Annabelle realized that there was a world of people out there waiting to laugh at the experience that virtually everyone shares, and she began to collect stories of being fired from friends and colleagues. Soon she was contributing regular \"Fired!\" segments to \"Day to Day\" on NPR and gathering friends to appear with her in sold-out performances of \"Fired!\" in Los Angeles and New York. \"Fired!,\" her documentary film inspired by these stories, comes out in 2006. This book is a collection of hilarious but true tales from people who've all gotten the ax, the boot, or been canned at some point in their lives. In \"That's a Fact,\" Andy Borowitz tells the story of being fired as a writer for the television sitcom \"The Facts of Life\" after being informed that he just didn't \"get\" Tootie. \"Take that hanger off your head, you idiot!\" were the last words Jeff Garlin heard before being fired from Spec's Music store after only one day on the job, just one of the many firings he recounts in \"That Garlin Boy.\" In \"Jimmy the Idiot,\" Dana Gould sums up his firing from the cast of the sitcom \"Working\" that led him to become a producer of \"The Simpsons\": \"In the second episode, I was a math genius, in the third -- a motocross racer, and in the fourth episode I was replaced by a chimp, but nobody noticed.\" In \"Poor Judgment,\" Illeana Douglas tells about being fired after a few hours of working as a coat check girl: \"How isit possible to be fired from hanging coats? I have arms. I know what coats are. I don't come home and throw my coat on the floor. I hang it in a closet. I have experience.\" How did Bob Saget find out he was being phased out of his job on \"The Morning Program\"? \"One day I showed up and my hosting chair was gone!\"<br /><br />With an all-star cast from Tim Allen to Morgan Spurlock, from Anne Meara to David Cross, and contributions from people from all over the country, this book proves it's not the bounce that counts, it's the bounce back.",

    "description": "Powerful New work by a modern master.<br /><br />You must listen, listen, listen.<br />Tired springs breathe under water.<br />At four in the morningthe last, lonely bolt of lightning<br />scribbles something quickly in the sky.<br />It says \"No.\" Or \"Never.<br />\"Or \"Take courage, the fire's not dead.\"<br />-from \"The Last Storm\"<br /><br /><i>Mysticism for Beginners</i> is the third and most beautiful of Adam Zagajewski's collections to appear in English. The poems are about nature, history, the life of cities, the transformations of art, the spiritual essence of everyday life. Their remarkable staying power derives from the gentle meditative authority of Zagajewski's voice, here expertly rered into English by Clare Cavanagh. Zagajewski's committed, compassionate poems offer access to the mysteries at the heart of experience.",

    "description": "About the Book: The Paradox of Choice. In the spirit of Alvin Tofflers Future Shock, a social critique of our obsession with choice, and how it contributes to anxiety, dissatisfaction and regret. Whether we're buying a pair of jeans, ordering a cup of coffee, selecting a long-distance carrier, applying to college, choosing a doctor, or setting up a 401K, everyday decisions have become increasingly complex due to the overwhelming abundance of choice with which we are presented. In The Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz explains why too much of a good thing has proven detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, Schwartz explains how a culture that thrives on the availability of constantly evolving options can also foster profound dissatisfaction and self-blame in individuals, which can lead to a paralysis in decision making and, in some cases, depression. With the latest studies on how we make choices in our personal and professional lives, Schwartz offers practical advice on how to focus on the right choices, and how to derive greater satisfaction from choices that we do make. About the Author: Barry Schwartz Barry Schwartz is the Dorwin Cartwright Professor of Social Theory and Social Action at Swarthmore College. He is the author of several books, including The Battle for Human Nature: Science, Morality and Modern Life and The Costs of Living: How Market Freedom Erodes the Best Things in Life. His articles have appeared in many of the leading journals in his field, including the American Psychologist. He lives in Philadelphia, PA.",

    "description": "<b>6 CDs, 51/2 hours</b><br />Lockwood, the new tenant of Thrushcross Grange on the bleak Yorkshire moors, is forced to seek shelter one night at Wuthering Heights, the home of his landlord. There he discovers the history of the tempestuous events that took place years before: of the intense passion between the foundling Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, and her betrayal of him. As Heathcliff's bitterness and vengeance are visited upon the next generation, their innocent heirs must struggle to escape the legacy of the past.",

    "description": "Born in 1951 in an affluent Tokyo suburb, Hajime - <i>beginning</i> in Japanese - has arrived at middle age wanting for almost nothing. The postwar years have brought him a fine marriage, two daughters, and an enviable career as the proprietor of two jazz clubs. Yet a nagging sense of inauthenticity about his success threatens Hajime's happiness. And a boyhood memory of a wise, lonely girl named Shimamoto clouds his heart.<br /><br />In <i>South of the Border, West of the Sun</i>, the simple arc of a man's life - with its attendant rhythms of success and disappointment - becomes the exquisite literary tableau of Haruki Murakami's most haunting work. When Shimamoto shows up one rainy night, now a breathtaking beauty with a secret from which she is unable to escape, the fault lines of doubt in Hajime's quotidian existence begin to give way. And the details of stolen moments past and present - a Nat King Cole melody, a face pressed against a window, a handful of ashes drifting downriver to the sea - threaten to undo him completely. Rich, mysterious, quietly dazzling, <i>South of the Border, West of the Sun</i> is Haruki Murakami's wisest and most compelling work.<br /><br />",

    "description": "<i>Winter Notes on Summer Impressions</i> is an early book-length essay by Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky which he composed while traveling in western Europe. Many commentators believe that in the themes it explores, the essay anticipates his later work <i>Notes from the Underground</i>.<br /><br /> In June 1862, Dostoevsky left Petersburg on his first excursion to Western Europe. Ostensibly making the trip to consult Western specialists about his epilepsy, he also wished to see firsthand the source of the Western ideas he believed were corrupting Russia. Over the course of his journey he visited a number of major cities, including Berlin, Paris, London, Florence, Milan, and Vienna. He recorded his impressions in <i>Winter Notes on Summer Impressions</i>, which were first published in the February 1863 issue of <i>Vremya (Time),</i> the periodical of which he was the editor.<br /><br /> Among other themes, Dostoevsky reveals his Pan-Slavism, rejecting European culture as corrupt and exhorting Russians to resist the temptation to emulate or adopt European ways of life.",

    "description": "This account of artisan &amp; working-class society in its formative years, 1780-1832, adds an important dimension to our understanding of the 19th century. E.P. Thompson shows how the working class took part in its own making &amp; recreates the whole life experience of people who suffered loss of status &amp; freedom, who underwent degradation &amp; who yet created a culture &amp; political consciousness of great vitality.<br /> \"Thompson's book has been called controversial, but perhaps only because so many have forgotten how explosive England was during the Regency &amp; the early reign of Victoria. Without any reservation, <b>The Making of the English Working Class</b> is the most important study of those days since the classic work of the Hammonds.\"--<i>Commentary</i><br /> \"Mr Thompson's deeply human imagination &amp; controlled passion help us to recapture the agonies, heroisms &amp; illusions of the working class as it made itself. No one interested in the history of the English people should fail to read his book.\"--<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>",

    "description": "<em>New and Collected Poems: 1931\u20142001</em> celebrates seven decades of Czeslaw Milosz\u2019s exceptional career. Widely regarded as one of the greatest poets of our time, Milosz is a master of probing inquiry and graceful expression. His poetry is infused with a tireless spirit and penetrating insight into fundamental human dilemmas and the staggering yet simple truth that \u201cto exist on the earth is beyond any power to name.\u201d<br /><br />Czeslaw Milosz worked with the Polish Resistance movement in Warsaw during World War II and defected to France in 1951. His work brings to bear the political awareness of an exile\u2014most notably in <em>A Treatise on Poetry,</em> a forty-page exploration of the world wars that rocked the first half of the twentieth century. His later poems also reflect the sharp political focus through which this Nobel Laureate never fails to bear witness to the events that stir the world.<br /><br />Digging among the rubble of the past, Milosz forges a vision that encompasses pain as well as joy. His work, wrote Edward Hirsch in the <em>New York Times Book Review,</em> is \u201cone of the monumental splendors of poetry in our age.\u201d With more than fifty poems from the end of Milosz\u2019s career, this is an essential collection from one of the most important voices in contemporary poetry.",

In the process he emerges as a hilariously complex everyman. And as Gray narrates his hero's free fall, he confirms his own stature as one of our funniest, most eccentric, and most engaging storytellers.",

    "description": "It's hard enough to satisfy choosy diners at a hot New York restaurant--imagine having to do it without using meat, fish, dairy, or eggs! The Candle Cafe has been doing just that for years, offering vegan food that has earned the praise of food critics, celebrities, and countless New Yorkers.<br /><br />The food at the Candle Cafe expands the horizons of vegan cuisine, proving that the healthiest food can also be the most flavorful and satisfying. From delectable appetizers like Quesadillas stuffed with Portobellos and Red Peppers and Tofu Satay with Coconut-Peanut Sauce to classic dips like Hummus and Babaganoush, veggan cooking never tasted this good. Even the soups are special--Spring Vegetable Minestrone Soup is filled with fresh flavor, and Butternut Squash Soup gets a kick from toasted pumpkin seeds. Hearty, satisfying sandwiches and main courses like Barbecued Tempeh-Chipotle Burgers with Grilled Pineapple, Porcini Mushroom Stroganoff, and Indian Eggplant Curry are infused with delicious flavors from around the world. For dessert, treats like Chocolate Mousse Pie and Lemon-Tofu Cheesecake with Blood Orange Glaze are creamy and indulgent.<br /><br />With helpful tips on cooking beans and grains, a full glossary of ingredients, and plenty of color photographs, <b>The Candle Cafe Cookbook</b> is a treasure trove of vegan recipes that have been drawing crowds and raves for years.",

    "description": "Life is rising up to meet us at every moment. The question is: Are we there to meet it or not? Diane Rizzetto presents a simple but supremely effective practice for meeting every moment of our lives with mindfulness, using the Zen precepts as tools to develop a keen awareness of the motivations behind every aspect of our behavior\u2014to \"wake up to what we do\"\u2014from moment to moment. As we train in mindfulness of our actions, every situation of our lives becomes our teacher, offering priceless insight into what it really means to be happy. It's a simple practice with transformative potential, enabling us to break through our habitual reactions and to see clearly how our own happiness and well-being are intimately, inevitably connected to the happiness and well-being of everyone around us.",

The legendary star of the classic sitcom <i>I Love Lucy</i> was at the pinnacle of her success when she sat down to record the story of her life. No comedienne had made America laugh so hard, no television actress had made the leap from radio and B movies to become one of the world's best-loved performers. This is her story--in her own words.<br /><br />The story of the ingenue from Jamestown, New York, determined to go to Broadway, destined to make a big splash, bound to marry her Valentino, Desi Arnaz. In her own inimitable style, she tells of their life together--both storybook and turbulent; intimate memories of their children and friends; wonderful backstage anecdotes; the empire they founded; the dissolution of their marriage. And, with a heartfelt happy ending, her enduring marriage to Gary Morton.<br /><br />Here is the lost manuscript that her fans and loved ones will treasure. Here is the laughter. Here is the life. Here's Lucy...",

    "description": "<i>Waiting for Daisy</i> is about loss, love, anger and redemption. It's about doing all the things you swore you'd never do to get something you hadn't even been sure you wanted. It's about being a woman in a confusing, contradictory time. It's about testing the limits of a loving marriage. And it's about trying (and trying and trying) to have a baby. <br />Orenstein's story begins when she tells her new husband that she's not sure she ever wants to be a mother; it ends six years later after she's done almost everything humanly possible to achieve that goal, from \"fertility sex\" to escalating infertility treatments to New Age remedies to forays into international adoption. Her saga unfolds just as professional women are warned by the media to heed the ticking of their biological clocks, and just as fertility clinics have become a boom industry, with over two million women a year seeking them out. Buffeted by one jaw-dropping obstacle after another, Orenstein seeks answers both medical and spiritual in America and Asia, along the way visiting an old flame who's now the father of fifteen, and discovering in Japan a ritual of surprising solace. All the while she tries to hold onto a marriage threatened by cycles, appointments, procedures and disappointments. <i>Waiting for Daisy</i> is an honest, wryly funny report from the front, an intimate page-turner that illuminates the ambivalence, obsession, and sacrifice that characterize so many modern women's lives.",

    "description": "Curtis Sittenfeld' s debut novel, <i>Prep</i>, is an insightful, achingly funny coming-of-age story as well as a brilliant dissection of class, race, and gender in a hothouse of adolescent angst and ambition. <br /><br />Lee Fiora is an intelligent, observant fourteen-year-old when her father drops her off in front of her dorm at the prestigious Ault School in Massachusetts. She leaves her animated, affectionate family in South Bend, Indiana, at least in part because of the boarding school' s glossy brochure, in which boys in sweaters chat in front of old brick buildings, girls in kilts hold lacrosse sticks on pristinely mown athletic fields, and everyone sings hymns in chapel. <br /><br />As Lee soon learns, Ault is a cloistered world of jaded, attractive teenagers who spend summers on Nantucket and speak in their own clever shorthand. Both intimidated and fascinated by her classmates, Lee becomes a shrewd observer of--and, ultimately, a participant in--their rituals and mores. As a scholarship student, she constantly feels like an outsider and is both drawn to and repelled by other loners. By the time she' s a senior, Lee has created a hard-won place for herself at Ault. But when her behavior takes a self-destructive and highly public turn, her carefully crafted identity within the community is shattered. Ultimately, Lee's experiences coalesce into a singular portrait of the painful and thrilling adolescence universal to us all.",

Frozen for decades in a trance-like state, these men and women were given up as hopeless until 1969, when Dr. Oliver Sacks gave them the then-new drug L-DOPA, which had an astonishing, explosive, \"awakening\" effect. Dr. Sacks recounts the moving case histories of his patients, their lives, and the extraordinary transformations which went with their reintroduction to a changed world.",

    "description": "In her acclaimed novels, Susan Vreeland has given us portraits of painting and life that are as dazzling as their artistic subjects. Now, in The Forest Lover she traces the courageous life and career of Emily Carr, who, more than Georgia O'Keeffe or Frida Kahlo, blazed a path for modern women artists. <br />Overcoming the confines of Victorian culture, Carr became a major force in modern art by capturing an untamed British Columbia and its indigenous peoples just before industrialization changed them forever. From illegal potlatches in tribal communities to artists studios in pre World War I Paris, Vreeland tells her story with gusto and suspense, giving us a glorious novel that will appeal to lovers of art, native cultures, and lush historical fiction.",

    "description": "In the her tenth collection (the title story of which is the basis for the new film <i>Hateship Loveship</i>), Alice Munro achieves new heights, creating narratives that loop and swerve like memory, and conjuring up characters as thorny and contradictory as people we know ourselves.<br /><br />A tough-minded housekeeper jettisons the habits of a lifetime because of a teenager\u2019s practical joke. A college student visiting her brassy, unconventional aunt stumbles on an astonishing secret and its meaning in her own life. An incorrigible philanderer responds with unexpected grace to his wife\u2019s nursing-home romance. <br /><br /><i>Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage</i> is Munro at her best, tirelessly observant, serenely free of illusion, deeply and gloriously humane.",

    "description": "The daughter of esteemed writer Paula Fox and the mother of Courtney Love relates \"the curse of the first-born daughter\" that has haunted four generations of her family. <br />As an adopted child, Linda Carroll created a magical world of her own, made up of dramatic adventures and the abiding fantasy that her real mother would come and take her away. When she finds herself pregnant at the age of eighteen, she is determined to have the perfect understanding with her child that she lacked with her adoptive mother. But readers will know better, for that baby grows up to be Courtney Love, desperately attention-seeking, deeply troubled, and one of the most talented women in rock. <br />Even as a baby, Courtney is beset by mood swings that no doctor can explain or cure. Her dark moods and paranoia escalate as she grows up, driving mother and daughter apart. When Courtney has a daughter of her own, Linda finally decides to find her own biological mother, and end the estrangement of generations of first-born daughters. <br />Her Mother's Daughter is Linda Carroll's story of self-discovery as an adopted daughter, a childlike hippie mother and a woman determined to find herself before finding her roots. Set apart from the typical celebrity memoir by Carroll's gifted storytelling, Her Mother's Daughter gives a fresh perspective on the elusive yet enduring connections between mothers and daughters, and reveals the true history of the wildly confabulatory Courtney Love. <br />LINDA CARROLL was adopted at birth, raised in San Francisco and only later discovered that her biological mother is the writer Paula Fox. Married at eighteen, and twice more before she was thirty, she is now the mother of five grown children, including singer/songwriter Courtney Love. She is a therapist and writer and lives in Corvallis, Oregon with her husband of seventeen years. <br />Advance Praise for Her Mother's Daughter <br />\"Even if you start reading Linda Carroll's memoir out of curiosity about her famous daughter and biological mother, you'll keep reading to find out more about Linda herself. This is no celebrity potboiler, but a fascinating, beautifully written work of narrative nonfiction; Carroll unites the intimate perspective of a psychologist, the contextual sense of a historian, and the clarity of a fine biographer in one absorbing package. One of her central themes is what she calls the \"curse of the first-born daughter,\" and it does seem that a tendency to live fascinating but difficult lives runs in these women's veins. But so, apparently, does the talent of drawing, holding, and rewarding our attention. Bravo, Linda Carroll!\" <br />--Martha Beck, author of Expecting Adam and Finding Your Own North Star <br />\"There is a delicious fictional quality to this true-life story that I found riveting. In Carroll's deft telling, the book is a kind of resurrection of a family.... I think I loved Her Mother's Daughter most for the devotion that Linda Carroll has for her unusual family through decades of separations and unconventional journeys.\" <br />--Terry Ryan, author of The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio <br />\"Looking backward and forward in time, this haunting memoir tells the story of a young woman's journey to finding herself, her birth mother, and her daughter, Courtney Love. The candor and power of these pages illuminates the difficulties of all mother-daughter relationships, but offers a rare glimpse into that elemental relationship when it is shadowed by the temperamental features of early-onset bipolar disorder. Linda Carroll has grit and grace, and writes like her mother's daughter.\" <br />--Demitri F. Papolos, M.D. and Janice Papolos, authors of The Bipolar Child",

    "description": "<b>Girls and computer games--and the movement to overcome the stereotyping that dominates the toy aisles.</b><br /><br />Many parents worry about the influence of video games on their children's lives. The game console may help to prepare children for participation in the digital world, but at the same time it socializes boys into misogyny and excludes girls from all but the most objectified positions. The new \"girls' games\" movement has addressed these concerns. Although many people associate video games mainly with boys, the girls games' movement has emerged from an unusual alliance between feminist activists (who want to change the \"gendering\" of digital technology) and industry leaders (who want to create a girls' market for their games).<br /><br />The contributors to <i>From Barbie(R) to Mortal Kombat </i>explore how assumptions about gender, games, and technology shape the design, development, and marketing of games as industry seeks to build the girl market. They describe and analyze the games currently on the market and propose tactical approaches for avoiding the stereotypes that dominate most toy store aisles. The lively mix of perspectives and voices includes those of media and technology scholars, educators, psychologists, developers of today's leading games, industry insiders, and girl gamers.<br /><br /><b>Contributors<br /></b>Aurora, Dorothy Bennett, Stephanie Bergman, Cornelia Brunner, Mary Bryson, Lee McEnany Caraher, Justine Cassell, Suzanne de Castell, Nikki Douglas, Theresa Duncan, Monica Gesue, Michelle Goulet, Patricia Greenfield, Margaret Honey, Henry Jenkins, Cal Jones, Yasmin Kafai, Heather Kelley, Marsha Kinder, Brenda Laurel, Nancie Martin, Aliza Sherman, Kaveri Subrahmanyam",

    "description": "\"Get a life\" William Shatner told <em>Star Trek </em>fans. Yet, as <em><strong>Textual Poachers</strong> </em>argues, fans already have a \"life,\" a complex subculture which draws its resources from commercial culture while also reworking them to serve alternative interests. Rejecting stereotypes of fans as cultural dupes, social misfits, and mindless consumers, Jenkins represents media fans as active producers and skilled manipulators of program meanings, as nomadic poachers constructing their own culture from borrowed materials, as an alternative social community defined through its cultural preferences and consumption practices.<br /><br />Written from an insider's perspective and providing vivid examples from fan artifacts, <em>Textual Poachers </em>offers an ethnographic account of the media fan community, its interpretive strategies, its social institutions and cultural practices, and its troubled relationship to the mass media and consumer capitalism. Drawing on the work of Michel de Certau, Jenkins shows how fans of <em>Star Trek</em>, <em>Blake's 7</em>, <em>The Professionals</em>, <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, <em>Starsky and Hutch, Alien Nation, Twin Peaks</em>, and other popular programs exploit these cultural materials as the basis for their stories, songs, videos, and social interatctions.<br /><br />Addressing both academics and fans, Jenkins builds a powerful case for the richness of fan culture as a popular response to the mass media and as a challenge to the producers' attempts to regulate textual meanings. <em>\n  <strong>Textual Poachers</strong>\n</em> guides readers through difficult questions about popular consumption, genre, gender, sexuality, and interpretation, documenting practices and processes which test and challenge basic assumptions of contemporary media theory.",

    "description": "What do you do after you walk down the aisle in four weddings in a few months-none of them your own? What's left after you've donned the must-have-not dresses of the season, forked over your cash, and fake-smiled your way through countless photos? After you've dealt with the smashed guest, the smooshed cake, the dashed hopes, and the missed bouquets? That's what Cate Padgett is starting to wonder, as she embarks on stint after stint on the sidelines, watching friends swap bar-hopping for baby-naming...while her own love life goes nowhere fast. But is Cate unwilling to settle down-or just unwilling to settle? And can anyone really judge her if they haven't walked in her dyed-to-match shoes?<br /><br />Wild, witty, and full of weddings to cry over, <b>Always the Bridesmaid</b> is an endearingly romantic comedy about standing out in the crowd even when everyone's wearing the same celery-green dress...and daring to make every day <b>The Happiest Day of Your Life</b>.",

    "description": "Every little girl has dreams of being rescued by the hero, of being swept away into a great adventure, of being the beautiful princess. Sadly, when women grow up, they are taught to be tough, efficient, and independent. Many Christian women are tired, struggling under the weight of the pressure to be a \"good servant,\" a nurturing caregiver, passionate lover, or capable home manager.<br /><br /><br />What the <em>Wild at Heart Field Manual</em> did for men, the <em>Captivating: A Guided Journal</em> can do for women. By revealing the three distinctly female desires every woman shares, John and Stasi Eldredge invite participants to recover their feminine hearts, which may have suffered many wounds but were originally defined in the image of a passionate God.",

The Gault family leads a life of privilege in early 1920s Ireland, but the threat of violence leads the parents of nine-year-old Lucy to decide to leave for England, her mother's home. Lucy cannot bear the thought of leaving Lahardane, their country house with its beautiful land and nearby beach, and a dog she has befriended. On the day before they are to leave, Lucy runs away, hoping to convince her parents to stay. Instead, she sets off a series of tragic misunderstandings that affect all of Lahardane's inhabitants for the rest of their lives.",

    "description": "FBI Agent Alex Cross is on vacation with his family in Disneyland when he gets a call from the Director. A well-known actress was shot outside her home in Beverly Hills. Shortly afterward, an editor for the Los Angeles Times receives an e-mail describing the murder in vivid details. Alex quickly learns that this is not an isolated incident. The killer, known as Mary Smith, has done this before and plans to kill again.<p>Right from the beginning, this case is like nothing Alex has ever been confronted with before. Is this the plan of an obsessed fan or a spurned actor, or is it part of something much more frightening? Now members of Hollywood's A-list fear they're next on Mary's list, and the case grows by blockbuster proportions as the LAPD and FBI scramble to find a pattern before Mary can send one more chilling update.</p>",

This edition, undertaken with the generous support of the Bollingen Foundation, has been launched with the purpose not only of republishing all of the printed works of Edwards but also of publishing the massive manuscript materials in which much of Edwards' most profound thinking and finest prose have been concealed.\n    \n    Published by Yale University Press.",

Unlike most kids, I didn't lose my secret-agent aspirations. So as a bright-eyed, idealistic college grad, I sent my resume to the CIA.Getting in was a story in itself. I peed in more cups than you could imagine, and was nearly condemned as a sexual deviant by the staff psychologist. My roommates were getting freaked out by government investigators lurking around, asking questions about my past.<br /><br />Finally, the CIA was training me to crash cars into barriers at 60 mph. Jump out of airplanes with cargo attached to my body. Survive interrogation, travel in alias, lose a tail. One thing they didn't teach us was how to date a guy while lying to him about what you do for a living. That I had to figure out for myself.<br /><br /><br /><br />Then I was posted overseas. And that's when the real fun began.<br />",

    "description": "A young Algerian, Meursault, afflicted with a sort of aimless inertia, becomes embroiled in the petty intrigues of a local pimp and, somewhat inexplicably, ends up killing a man. Once he's imprisoned and eventually brought to trial, his crime, it becomes apparent, is not so much the arguably defensible murder he has committed as it is his deficient character. The trial's proceedings are absurd, a parsing of incidental trivialities--that Meursault, for instance, seemed unmoved by his own mother's death and then attended a comic movie the evening after her funeral are two ostensibly damning facts--so that the eventual sentence the jury issues is both ridiculous and inevitable. Meursault remains a cipher nearly to the story's end: dispassionate, clinical, disengaged from his own emotions. His confrontation with the gentle indifference of the world remains as compelling as it was when Camus first recounted it.",

Influenced by works such as Don Juan, and the novels of Kafka, these essays begin with a meditation on suicide: the question of living or not living in an absurd universe devoid of order or meaning. With lyric eloquence, Camus posits a way out of despair, reaffirming the value of personal existence, and the possibility of life lived with dignity and authenticity.",

    "description": "This dazzling novel from a fiercely talented young writer -- winner of the 2001 National Magazine Award for Fiction -- follows a woman whose indelible crime of passion leaves no one and nothing unscathed. \"The City Is a Rising Tide\" unfolds against a stunning backdrop of history, culture, and landscape -- from the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze to the refined vistas of Central Park, from the Cultural Revolution to the surreal world of moviemaking. In New York City, Justine Laxness works as a money manager at a nonprofit, the Aquinas Foundation. Justine's love for her boss, Peter, is unrequited, despite their deep friendship and extensive history: they first met in the early 1970s, when Justine was a child living in Beijing with her Christian family. Peter, then twenty-eight and stationed in China while working for Richard Nixon, had fallen in love with Justine's nanny, Su Chen -- a Communist revolutionary under Mao -- and still feels guilt for his part in her disappearance and death.<br /><br />Justine's obsession with Peter spurs her to embezzle funds from Aquinas and lend the money to James Nutter, a screenwriter and old college flame who has resurfaced in Justine's life after ten years. But every action she takes will have unforeseen ramifications, creating a tidal wave of betrayal and destruction. Lyrical and suspenseful by turns, \"The City Is a Rising Tide\" is an enchanting work of luminous prose and uncommon imagination.",

    "description": "In the wake of a suicide, the most troubling questions are invariably the most difficult to answer: how could we have known? What could we have done? And always, unremittingly: why? Written by a clinical psychologist whose own life has been touched by suicide, this book offers the clearest account ever given of why some people choose to die. Drawing on extensive clinical and epidemiological evidence, as well as personal experience. Thomas Joiner brings a comprehensive understanding to seemingly incomprehensible behaviour. Among the many people who have considered, attempted, or died by suicide, he finds three factors that mark those most at risk of death: the feeling of being a burden on loved ones; the sense of isolation; and, chillingly, the learned ability to hurt oneself",

    "description": "With her first novel, <i>Liars and Saints,</i> award-winning author Maile Meloy more than delivers on the promise of her highly acclaimed debut story collection, <i>Half in Love.</i> This novel tells a story of sex and longing, love and loss, and of the deceit that can lie at the heart of family relationships. Set in California, <i>Liars and Saints</i> follows four generations of the Catholic Santerre family from World War II to the present. In a family driven as much by jealousy and propriety as by love, an unspoken tradition of deceit is passed from generation to generation. When tragedy shatters their precarious domestic lives, it takes astonishing courage and compassion to bring them back together. By turns funny and disturbing, irreverent and profound, <i>Liars and Saints</i> is a masterful display of Maile Meloy's prodigious gifts and of her penetrating insight into an extraordinary American family and into the nature of human love.",

With her singular mix of surrealism, musical prose, and keenly felt emotion, Bender once again proves herself to be a masterful chronicler of the human condition.",

    "description": "\"Don't talk to strangers\" is the advice long given to children by parents of all classes and races. Today it has blossomed into a fundamental precept of civic education, reflecting interracial distrust, personal and political alienation, and a profound suspicion of others. In this powerful and eloquent essay, Danielle Allen, a 2002 MacArthur Fellow, takes this maxim back to Little Rock, rooting out the seeds of distrust to replace them with \"a citizenship of political friendship.\"<br /><br /> Returning to the landmark <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> decision of 1954 and to the famous photograph of Elizabeth Eckford, one of the Little Rock Nine, being cursed by fellow \"citizen\" Hazel Bryan, Allen argues that we have yet to complete the transition to political friendship that this moment offered. By combining brief readings of philosophers and political theorists with personal reflections on race politics in Chicago, Allen proposes strikingly practical techniques of citizenship. These tools of political friendship, Allen contends, can help us become more trustworthy to others and overcome the fossilized distrust among us.<br /><br /> Sacrifice is the key concept that bridges citizenship and trust, according to Allen. She uncovers the ordinary, daily sacrifices citizens make to keep democracy working\u2014and offers methods for recognizing and reciprocating those sacrifices. Trenchant, incisive, and ultimately hopeful, <i>Talking to Strangers</i> is nothing less than a manifesto for a revitalized democratic citizenry.<br />",

As a traditional psychotherapist, Dr. Brian Weiss was astonished and skeptical when one of his patients began recalling past-life traumas that seemed to hold the key to her recurring nightmares and anxiety attacks. His skepticism was eroded, however, when she began to channel messages from the space between lives, which contained remarkable revelations about Dr. Weiss' family and his dead son. Using past-life therapy, he was able to cure the patient and embark on a new, more meaningful phase of his own career.",

And to what lengths would you go to establish that in fact you'd done nothing wrong at all? After an accident robs Hazel of three years' worth of memory, just such an opportunity is granted to her ex-boyfriend Jonathan. What follows in Margot Livesey's <i>The Missing World</i> is a brilliant inverted love story: one man's desperate attempts to realize and rationalize a lie, and a woman's harrowing attempts to recognize the truth.",

    "description": "In Alice Munro\u2019s superb new collection, we find stories about women of all ages and circumstances, their lives made palpable by the subtlety and empathy of this incomparable writer.<br /><br />The runaway of the title story is a young woman who, though she thinks she wants to, is incapable of leaving her husband. In \"Passion,\" a country girl emerging into the larger world via a job in a resort hotel discovers in a single moment of stunning insight the limits and lies of that mysterious emotion. Three stories are about a woman named Juliet\u2013in the first, she escapes from teaching at a girls\u2019 school into a wild and irresistible love match; in the second she returns with her child to the home of her parents, whose life and marriage she finally begins to examine; and in the last, her child, caught, she mistakenly thinks, in the grip of a religious cult, vanishes into an unexplained and profound silence. In the final story, \"Powers,\" a young woman with the ability to read the future sets off a chain of events that involves her husband-to-be and a friend in a lifelong pursuit of what such a gift really means, and who really has it.<br /><br />Throughout this compelling collection, Alice Munro\u2019s understanding of the people about whom she writes makes them as vivid as our own neighbors. Here are the infinite betrayals and surprises of love\u2013between men and women, between friends, between parents and children\u2013that are the stuff of all our lives. It is Alice Munro\u2019s special gift to make these stories as vivid and real as our own.<br />(front flap)<br /><br />Runaway -- Chance -- Soon -- Silence -- Passion -- Trespasses -- Tricks -- Powers.",

I will capture nights all over the world and bring them to you.'<br />Henry Rollins, renowned spoken-word performer, musician, actor and author of several books, has a unique, hard-edged view of the world. This collection of writings from 1989 - 1991 is the classic Rollins book.<br />From dramatic fiction shorts detailing stark, disturbing realities to gut-wrenching tour journals destroying all misconceptions of the glamour of fame and the music industry; from the challenging poetry to revealing dream sequences, Rollins' writing is unflinching in its honesty, uncompromising in its truth and irresistibly addictive.",

    "description": "The poorest 46 percent of humankind have 1.2 percent of global income.<br />Their purchasing power per person per day is less than that of $2.15 in<br />the US in 1993; 826 million of them do not have enough to eat. One-third<br />of all human deaths are from poverty-related causes: 18 million<br />annually, including 12 million children under five.<p>At the other end, the 15 percent of humankind in the 'high-income<br />economies' have 80 percent of global income. Shifting 1 or 2 percent of<br />our share toward poverty eradication seems morally compelling. Yet the<br />prosperous 1990s have in fact brought a large shift toward greater<br />global inequality, as most of the affluent believe that they have no<br />such responsibility.</p><p>Thomas Pogge's book seeks to explain how this belief is sustained. He analyses how our moral and economic theorizing and our global economic order have adapted to make us appear disconnected from massive poverty abroad. Dispelling the illusion, he also offers a modest, widely sharable standard of global economic justice and makes detailed, realistic proposals toward fulfilling it.</p>",

    "description": "Opening on the windswept front of Morecambe Bay, on the remote north-west coast of England, <i>The Electric Michelangelo</i> is a novel of love, loss and the art of tattooing.<br /><br />In the uniquely sensuous and lyrical prose that has already become her trademark, Sarah Hall's remarkable new novel tells the story of Cy Parks, from his childhood years spent in a seaside guest house for consumptives with his mother, Reeda, to his apprenticeship as a tattoo-artist with Eliot Riley - a scraper with a reputation as a Bolshevik and a drinker to boot.<br /><br />His skills acquired and a thirst for experience burning within him, Cy departs for America and the riotous world of the Coney Island boardwalk, where he sets up his own business as 'The Electric Michelangelo'. In this carnival environment of roller-coasters and freak-shows, while the crest of the Edwardian amusement industry wave is breaking, Cy becomes enamoured with Grace, a mysterious East European immigrant and circus performer who commissions him to cover her body entirely with tattooed eyes.<br /><br />Hugely atmospheric, exotic, and familiar, <i>The Electric Michelangelo</i> is a love story and an exquisitely rendered portrait of seaside resorts on opposite sides of the Atlantic by one of the most uniquely talented novelists of her generation.",

    "description": "In this collection of essays, the author of <i>High Tide in Tucson</i> brings to us (out of one of history's darker moments) an extended love song to the world we still have. From its opening parable gleaned from recent news about a lost child saved in an astonishing way, the book moves on to consider a world of surprising and hopeful prospects ranging from an inventive conservation scheme in a remote jungle to the backyard flock of chickens tended by the author's small daughter.<br /><br />Whether she is contemplating the Grand Canyon, her vegetable garden, motherhood, adolescence, genetic engineering, TV-watching, the history of civil rights, or the future of a nation founded on the best of all human impulses, these essays are grounded in the author's belief that our largest problems have grown from the earth's remotest corners as well as our own backyards, and that answers may lie in those places, too. In the voice Kingsolver's readers have come to rely on - sometimes grave, occasionally hilarious, and ultimately persuasive - <i>Small Wonder</i> is a hopeful examination of the people we seem to be, and what we might yet make of ourselves.",

    "description": "\"Here is the first full translation into English of one of the 20th century's few undoubted classics of history.\" \u2014<i>Washington Post Book World</i><br /><br /><i>The Autumn of the Middle Ages</i> is Johan Huizinga's classic portrait of life, thought, and art in fourteenth- and fifteenth-century France and the Netherlands. Few who have read this book in English realize that <i>The Waning of the Middle Ages,</i> the only previous translation, is vastly different from the original Dutch, and incompatible will all other European-language translations. <br /><br />For Huizinga, the fourteenth- and fifteenth-century marked not the birth of a dramatically new era in history\u2014the Renaissance\u2014but the fullest, ripest phase of medieval life and thought. However, his work was criticized both at home and in Europe for being \"old-fashioned\" and \"too literary\" when <i>The Waning of the Middle Ages</i> was first published in 1919. In the 1924 translation, Fritz Hopman adapted, reduced and altered the Dutch edition\u2014softening Huizinga's passionate arguments, dulling his nuances, and eliminating theoretical passages. He dropped many passages Huizinga had quoted in their original old French. Additionally, chapters were rearranged, all references were dropped, and mistranslations were introduced.<br /><br />This translation corrects such errors, recreating the second Dutch edition which represents Huizinga's thinking at its most important stage. Everything that was dropped or rearranged has been restored. Prose quotations appear in French, with translations preprinted at the bottom of the page, mistranslations have been corrected.<br /><br />\"The advantages of the new translation are so many. . . . It is one of the greatest, as well as one of the most enthralling, historical classics of the twentieth century, and everyone will surely want to read it in the form that was obviously intended by the author.\" \u2014Francis Haskell, <i>New York Review of Books</i><br /><br />\"A once pathbreaking piece of historical interpretation. . . . This new translation will no doubt bring Huizinga and his pioneering work back into the discussion of historical interpretation.\" \u2014Rosamond McKitterick, <i>New York Times Book Review</i>",

    "description": "In an era when women were supposed to be disciplined and obedient, Anna proved to be neither. Defying 16th-century social mores, she was the frequent subject of gossip because of her immodest dress and flirtatious behavior. When her wealthy father discovered that she was having secret, simultaneous affairs with a young nobleman and a cavalryman, he turned her out of the house in rage, but when she sued him for financial support, he had her captured, returned home and chained to a table as punishment. Anna eventually escaped and continued her suit against her father, her siblings and her home town in a bitter legal battle that was to last 30 years and end only upon her death. Drawn from her surviving love letters and court records, <em>The Burgermeister's Daughter</em> is a fascinating examination of the politics of sexuality, gender and family in the 16th century, and a powerful testament to the courage and tenacity of a woman who defied the inequalities of this distant age.",

Once, Indians also lived on the island. And when they left and sailed to the east, one young girl was left behind.This is the story of Karana, the Indian girl who lived alone for years on the Island of the Blue Dolphins. Year after year, she watched one season pass into another and waited for a ship to take her away. But while she waited, she kept herself alive by building shelter, making weapons, finding food, and fighting her enemies, the wild dogs. Hers is not only an unusual adventure of survival, but also a tale of natural beauty and personal discovery.",

The there are the greasers, like Ponyboy, who aren't so lucky. Ponyboy has a few things he can count on, hid older brothers, his friends, and trouble with the Socs, whose idea of a good time is beating up greasers like Ponyboy. At least he knows what to expect--until the night things go too far.<br /><br />When it was first published in 1967, The Outsiders struck an immediate chord with its readers. Defying convention, the groundbreaking novel became a touchstone of honesty and excellence in its genre. As Jodi Picault observes in her perceptive introduction, it continues to resonate with its powerful portrait of the bonds and boundaries of friendship.<br />(back cover)",

One of them, George H. W. Bush, was miraculously rescued. What happened to the other eight remained a secret for almost 60 years. <br /><br />After the war, the American and Japanese governments conspired to cover up the shocking truth, and not even the families of the airmen were informed of what happened to their sons. Their fate remained a mystery--until now. <br /><br />FLYBOYS is a tale of courage and daring, of war and death, of men and hope. It will make you proud and it will break your heart.",

    "description": "Pauline Maier shows us the Declaration as both the defining statement of our national identity and the moral standard by which we live as a nation. It is truly \"American Scripture,\" and Maier tells us how it came to be -- from the Declaration's birth in the hard and tortuous struggle by which Americans arrived at Independence to the ways in which, in the nineteenth century, the document itself became sanctified.<br /><br />Maier describes the transformation of the Second Continental Congress into a national government, unlike anything that preceded or followed it, and with more authority than the colonists would ever have conceded to the British Parliament; the great difficulty in making the decision for Independence; the influence of Paine's <i>Common Sense</i>, which shifted the terms of debate; and the political maneuvers that allowed Congress to make the momentous decision.<br /><br />In Maier's hands, the Declaration of Independence is brought close to us. She lets us hear the voice of the people as revealed in the other \"declarations\" of 1776: the local resolutions -- most of which have gone unnoticed over the past two centuries -- that explained, advocated, and justified Independence and undergirded Congress's work. Detective-like, she discloses the origins of key ideas and phrases in the Declaration and unravels the complex story of its drafting and of the group-editing job which angered Thomas Jefferson.<br /><br />Maier also reveals what happened to the Declaration after the signing and celebration: how it was largely forgotten and then revived to buttress political arguments of the nineteenth century; and, most important, how Abraham Lincoln ensured its persistence as a living force in American society. Finally, she shows how by the very act of venerating the Declaration as we do -- by holding it as sacrosanct, akin to holy writ -- we may actually be betraying its purpose and its power.",

    "description": "A brilliant new approach to the Constitution and courts of the United States by Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.For Justice Breyer, the Constitution\u2019s primary role is to preserve and encourage what he calls \u201cactive liberty\u201d: citizen participation in shaping government and its laws. As this book argues, promoting active liberty requires judicial modesty and deference to Congress; it also means recognizing the changing needs and demands of the populace. Indeed, the Constitution\u2019s lasting brilliance is that its principles may be adapted to cope with unanticipated situations, and Breyer makes a powerful case against treating it as a static guide intended for a world that is dead and gone. Using contemporary examples from federalism to privacy to affirmative action, this is a vital contribution to the ongoing debate over the role and power of our courts.",

It is filled with intimate portraits of the kind of people, rich or poor, Eastern or Western, famous or humble, whose lives continue to revolve around the horse.<br /><br />Korda is a terrific storyteller, and his book is intensely personal and seductive, a joy for everyone who loves horses. Even those who have never ridden will be happy to saddle up and follow him through the world of horses, horse people, and the riding life.",

    "description": "More than any other Persian poet, it is perhaps Hafiz who accesses the mystical, healing dimensions of poetry. Because his poems were often ecstatic love songs from God to his beloved world, many have called Hafiz the \"Tongue of the Invisible.\"<br /><br />With this stunning collection of 250 of Hafiz's most intimate poems, Daniel Ladinsky has succeeded brilliantly in capturing the essence of one of Islam's greatest poetic and religious voices. Each line of THE GIFT imparts the wonderful qualities of the spiritual teacher: an audacious love that empowers lives, profound knowledge, wild generosity, and a sweet, playful genius unparalleled in world literature.",

Now, world-renowned authors Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson have teamed up to combine their unrivalled talents. Together they have created the fifth edition of this masterpiece, making it the most thorough and expansive revision ever of the work. In keeping with the Atlas's reputation for cartographic excellence, all 148 maps from the fourth edition have been completely revised and modernised, with an additional 30 new maps. Hailed by Decanter as Wine Book of the Millennium, The World Atlas of Wine has been described by critics worldwide as 'extraordinary' and 'irreplaceable'. In this, its fifth edition in 30 years, it remains an essential addition to every wine-lovers or professional's library.",

    "description": "<b>Gripping, insightful and deft, THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US by Maggie O'Farrell is a haunting story of the way our families shape our lives, from the award-winning author of THIS MUST BE THE PLACE. It was a <i>Sunday Times</i> Top Ten bestseller and won the Somerset Maugham Award.</b><br /><b></b><br /><b></b>On a cold February afternoon, Stella catches sight of a man she hasn't seen for many years, but instantly recognises. Or thinks she does. At the same moment on the other side of the globe, in the middle of a crowd of Chinese New Year revellers, Jake realises that things are becoming dangerous.<br /><br />They know nothing of one another's existence, but both Stella and Jake flee their lives: Jake in search of a place so remote it doesn't appear on any map, and Stella for a destination in Scotland, the significance of which only her sister, Nina, will understand.",

    "description": "Cokie Roberts's #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>We Are Our Mothers Daughters</em> examined the nature of women's roles throughout history and led <em>USA Today</em> to praise her as a \"custodian of time-honored values.\" Her second bestseller, <em>From This Day Forward</em>, written with her husband, Steve Roberts, described American marriages throughout history. Now Cokie returns with <em>Founding Mothers</em>, an intimate look at the passionate women whose tireless pursuits on behalf of their families and country proved just as crucial to the forging of a new nation as the rebellion that established it.<br /><br />Roberts reveals the often surprising stories of these fascinating women, bringing to life the everyday trials of individuals like Abigail Adams, Mercy Otis Warren, Eliza Pinckney, Mary Bartlett and Martha Washington -- proving that without our exemplary women, the new country might have never survived.<br /><br />Social history at its best, <em>Founding Mothers</em> unveils the determination, creative insight and passion of the other patriots, the women who raised our nation. Cokie Roberts proves beyond doubt that like every generation of American women that has followed, the founding mothers used the unique gifts of their gender -- courage, pluck, sadness, joy, energy, grace, sensitivity and humor -- to do what women do best, put one foot in front of the other in remarkable circumstances, and carry on.",

    "description": "With the clarity of a physicist and the compassion of a gifted healer with more than twenty years of professional experience observing 5,000 clients and students, Barbara Ann Brennan presents the first in-depth study of the human energy field for people who seek happiness and health, and who wish to achieve their full potential. Our physical bodies exist within a larger 'body' , a human energy field or aura, which is the vehicle through which we create our experience or reality, including health and illness. It is through this energy field that we have the power to heal ourselves.This energy body - only recently verified by scientists, but long known to healers and mystics - is the starting point of an illness. Here, our most powerful and profound human interactions take place, the precursor and healer of all physiological and emotional disturbances. Hands of Light offers:<br />* a new paradigm for the human in health, relationships and disease<br />* an understanding of how the human energy field looks and functions<br />* training in the ability to see and interpret auras<br />* medically verified case studies of healing people from all walks of life with a variety of illnesses<br />* guidelines for healing the self and others",

Staggering through terminals and hotel lobbies with overstuffed suitcases, trunks, duffels, and backpacks.<br /><br />Backs ache. Feet burn. Eyelids droop.<br /><br />We've all seen people like that.<br /><br />At times, we are people like that -- if not with our physical luggage, then at least with our spiritual load.<br /><br />We all lug loads we were never intended to carry. Fear. Worry. Discontent. No wonder we get so weary. We're worn out from carrying that excess baggage. Wouldn't it be nice to lose some of those bags?<br /><br />That's the invitation of Max Lucado. With the Twenty-third Psalm as our guide, let's release some of the burdens we were never intended to bear.<br /><br />Using these verses as a guide, Max Lucado walks us through a helpful inventory of our burdens. May God use this Psalm to remind you to release the burdens you were never meant to bear.",

    "description": "First published in 1974, The Front Runner raced to international acclaim - the first novel about gay love to become popular with mainstream. <br /><br />In 1975, coach Harlan Brown is hiding from his past at an obscure New York college, after he was fired from Penn State University on suspicion of being gay. A tough, lonely ex-Marine of 39, Harlan has never allowed himself to love another man. <br /><br />Then Billy Sive, a brilliant young runner, shows up on his doorstep. He and his two comrades, Vince Matti and Jacques LaFont, were just thrown off a major team for admitting they are gay. Harlan knows that, with proper training, Billy could go to the '76 Olympics in Montreal. He agrees to coach the three boys under strict conditions that thwart Billy's growing attraction for his mature but compelling mentor. The lean, graceful frontrunner with gold-rim glasses sees directly into Harlan's heart. Billy's gentle and open acceptance of his sexuality makes Harlan afraid to confront either the pain of his past, or the challenges which lay in wait if their intimacy is exposed. <br /><br />But when Coach Brown finds himself falling in love with his most gifted athlete, he must combat his true feelings for Billy or risk the outrage of the entire sports world - and their only chance at Olympic gold.",

    "description": "Hilarious, sexy, and deeply tender, <b>Kissing in Manhattan</b> was one of the most celebrated debuts in recent years. Acclaimed author David Schickler\u2019s collection of linked stories follows a troupe of love-hungry urbanites through a charmed metropolis and into the Preemption--a mythic Manhattan apartment building. The Preemption sets the stage for a romantic fantasy as exuberant, dark, and dazzling as the city it occupies. Behind closed doors, the paths of an improbable cast of tenants--a seductive perfume heiress; a crabby, misunderstood actor; a preternaturally sharp-sighted priest--tangle and cross, while a perilous love triangle builds around three characters: <br /><br />James Branch, a shy young accountant with an unusual love for the Preemption\u2019s antique elevator, and a strange destiny... <br /><br />Patrick Rigg, a Wall Street lothario who soothes his pain by seducing <br />beautiful women, carrying a gun, and attending the nightly sermons of a foreboding priest... <br /><br />Rally McWilliams, a fetching, hopeful young writer who roams the city at night, searching for the soulmate she believes in but can\u2019t find...<br /><br />Charged with joy and a deadly sense of humor, <b>Kissing in Manhattan</b> is a daring new writer\u2019s vision of a world where men and women, good and evil, love and sex, meet, battle, and embrace on every street corner.",

    "description": "Like his contemporary and rival Sigmund Freud, Robert Musil boldly explored the dark, irrational undercurrents of humanity. <i>The Confusions of Young T\u00f6rless</i>, published in 1906 while he was a student, uncovers the bullying, snobbery, and vicious homoerotic violence at an elite boys academy. Unsparingly honest in its depiction of the author's tangled feelings about his mother, other women, and male bonding, it also vividly illustrates the crisis of a whole society, where the breakdown of traditional values and the cult of pitiless masculine strength were soon to lead to the cataclysm of the First World War and the rise of fascism. More than a century later, Musil's first novel still retains its shocking, prophetic power.",

    "description": "Die 30-j\u00e4hrige Diablo Cody ist ein Ph\u00e4nomen. Mit ihrem Internet-Blog machte sie sich einen Namen, dann schoss sie raketenhaft in den Himmel der US-Literatur. F\u00fcr ihr erstes Drehbuch erhielt sie einen Oscar, Steven Spielberg besch\u00e4ftigt sie als Dialogberaterin. Besser und h\u00f6her kann man eigentlich nicht kommen<p> <i>Nackt</i> zeigt, dass Cody diesen kometenhaften Aufstieg mehr als verdient hat. Rasant, packend und komisch erz\u00e4hlt sie, wie sie (oder doch zumindest ihre Ich-Erz\u00e4hlerin) trotz einer eher biederen Biografie die Leidenschaft f\u00fcrs Strippen entdeckt. Wie sie gleich beim ersten, g\u00e4nzlich missgl\u00fcckten Auftritt durch den Alltag mit menstruierenden oder gyn\u00e4kologisch ausladenden Kolleginnen alle romantischen Vorstellungen ihres Gewerbes verliert \u2013 und trotzdem von der Stripperstange im positiven Sinne nicht mehr loskommt. Und sie erz\u00e4hlt von ihrer Liebe zu ihrem coolen, (fast) perfekten Partner Jonny \u2013 und das, ohne auch nur eine Sekunde dem Kitsch zu verfallen.</p><p> <i>Nackt</i> gibt sich als Enth\u00fcllungsroman. Aber er enth\u00e4lt auch unglaublich lyrische Passagen und Kapitel wie das \u00fcber die \u201ezehn besten Songs zum Strippen\u201c. So kann man das Buch auch als Anleitung zum Auftritt bei Table-Dance-Partys oder Burlesk-Shows lesen. Aber egal, warum man <i>Nackt</i> zur Hand nimmt: so frisch, frech und frei von der Seele (oder Leber) weg \u2013 und dabei doch so strukturiert und gemessen \u2013 wie Diablo Cody hat lange niemand mehr geschrieben. Das ist eine v\u00f6llig neue, von Teja Schwaner im \u00dcbrigen blendend ins Deutsche \u00fcbertragene Stimme aus Amerika, von der man noch oft und viel lesen m\u00f6chte. <i>-- Stefan Kellerer</i></p>",

    "description": "Award-winning author Amy Stewart takes readers on an around-the-world, behind-the-scenes look at the flower industry and how it has sought\u2014for better or worse\u2014to achieve perfection. She tracks down the hybridizers, geneticists, farmers, and florists working to invent, manufacture, and sell flowers that are bigger, brighter, and sturdier than anything nature can provide. There's a scientist intent on developing the first genetically modified blue rose; an eccentric horitcultural legend who created the most popular lily; a breeder of gerberas of every color imaginable; and an Ecuadorean farmer growing exquisite roses, the floral equivalent of a Tiffany diamond. And, at every turn she discovers the startling intersection of nature and technology, of sentiment and commerce.",

Saddam's regime is buried. Baghdad lies in ruins.</b> Now the eyes of the world are on Jon Bennett and Erin McCoy, two senior White House advisors, as they arrive in the Middle East to offer <b>a historic Arab-Israeli peace plan and the American president's new vision of freedom and democracy.</b> But in the shadows lie men whose hearts are filled with evil\u2015men for whom the prospect of peace goes against everything they believe. And soon one terrifying scheme after another begins to unfold. As Jon and Erin face a battle for control of Jerusalem and the Holy Land and an Iraqi plan to rebuild ancient Babylon, they can't help but wonder: are such signs evidence that they are living in the last days before the return of Christ?",

At last, a book for the under-35 generation that explains why it\u2019s not their fault, and what can be done about it. <i>Strapped</i> offers a groundbreaking look at the new obstacle course facing young adults. Getting ahead, argues commentator and policy maven Tamara Draut, is getting harder. A college degree is the new high school diploma\u2013and costs a fortune to obtain. Good jobs are scarcer thanks to stagnant wages and disappearing benefits. And, the cost of everything\u2013starter homes, health coverage, child care\u2013keeps going up. Witty and wise, <i>Strapped </i>brims with ideas for fashioning a new kind of America in which every young person can go to college, buy a home, and start a family. The future starts here.",

    "description": "Who is the devil <i>you</i> know? <br /><br />Is it your lying, cheating ex-husband?<br />Your sadistic high school gym teacher?<br />Your boss who loves to humiliate people in meetings?<br />The colleague who stole your idea and passed it off as her own?<br /><br />In the pages of <i>The Sociopath Next Door</i>, you will realize that your ex was not just misunderstood. He\u2019s a sociopath. And your boss, teacher, and colleague? They may be sociopaths too.<br /><br />We are accustomed to think of sociopaths as violent criminals, but in <i>The Sociopath Next Door</i>, Harvard psychologist Martha Stout reveals that a shocking 4 percent of ordinary people\u2014one in twenty-five\u2014has an often undetected mental disorder, the chief symptom of which is that that person possesses no conscience. He or she has no ability whatsoever to feel shame, guilt, or remorse. One in twenty-five everyday Americans, therefore, is secretly a sociopath. They could be your colleague, your neighbor, even family. And they can do literally anything at all and feel absolutely no guilt. <i>\n  <br /></i><br />How do we recognize the remorseless? One of their chief characteristics is a kind of glow or charisma that makes sociopaths more charming or interesting than the other people around them. They\u2019re more spontaneous, more intense, more complex, or even sexier than everyone else, making them tricky to identify and leaving us easily seduced. Fundamentally, sociopaths are different because they cannot love. Sociopaths learn early on to show sham emotion, but underneath they are indifferent to others\u2019 suffering. They live to dominate and thrill to win. <br /><br />The fact is, we all almost certainly know at least one or more sociopaths already. Part of the urgency in reading <i>The Sociopath Next Door</i> is the moment when we suddenly recognize that someone we know\u2014someone we worked for, or were involved with, or voted for\u2014is a sociopath. But what do we do with that knowledge? To arm us against the sociopath, Dr. Stout teaches us to question authority, suspect flattery, and beware the pity play. Above all, she writes, when a sociopath is beckoning, do not join the game. <br /><br />It is the ruthless versus the rest of us, and <i>The Sociopath Next Door</i> will show you how to recognize and defeat the devil you know.",

    "description": "\u201cA superb new drama written by John Patrick Shanley. It is an inspired study in moral uncertainty with the compellingly certain structure of an old-fashioned detective drama. Even as <i>Doubt</i> holds your conscious attention as an intelligently measured debate play, it sends off stealth charges that go deeper emotionally. One of the year\u2019s ten best.\u201d\u2014Ben Brantley, <i>The New York Times</i><br /><br />\u201c[The] #1 show of the year. How splendid it feels to be trusted with such passionate, exquisite ambiguity unlike anything we have seen from this prolific playwright so far. Blunt yet subtle, manipulative but full of empathy for all sides, the play is set in 1964 but could not be more timely. <i>Doubt</i> is a lean, potent drama . . . passionate, exquisite, important, and engrossing.\u201d\u2014Linda Winer, <i>Newsday</i><br /><br />Chosen as the best play of the year by over 10 newspapers and magazines, <i>Doubt</i> is set in a Bronx Catholic school in 1964, where a strong-minded woman wrestles with conscience and uncertainty as she is faced with concerns about one of her male colleagues. This new play by John Patrick Shanley\u2014the Bronx-born-and-bred playwright and Academy Award-winning author of <i>Moonstruck</i>\u2014dramatizes issues straight from today\u2019s headlines within a world re-created with knowing detail and a judicious eye. After a stunning, sold-out production at Manhattan Theatre Club, the play has transferred to Broadway.<br /><br /><b>John Patrick Shanley</b> is the author of numerous plays, including <i>Danny and the Deep Blue Sea</i>, <i>Dirty Story</i>, <i>Four Dogs and a Bone</i>, <i>Psychopathia Sexualis</i>, <i>Sailor\u2019s Song</i>, <i>Savage in Limbo</i>, and <i>Where\u2019s My Money?</i>. He has written extensively for TV and film, and his credits include the teleplay for <i>Live from Baghdad</i> and screenplays for <i>Congo</i>, <i>Alive</i>, <i>Five Corners</i>, <i>Joe Versus the Volcano</i> (which he also directed), and <i>Moonstruck</i>, for which he won an Academy Award for original screenplay.",

    "description": "This exquisite novel tells the story of one of the most compelling heroines in modern literature--Emma Bovary. Unhappily married to a devoted, clumsy provincial doctor, Emma revolts against the ordinariness of her life by pursuing voluptuous dreams of ecstasy and love. But her sensuous and sentimental desires lead her only to suffering corruption and downfall. A brilliant psychological portrait, <i>Madame Bovary</i> searingly depicts the human mind in search of transcendence. Who is Madame Bovary? Flaubert's answer to this question was superb: \"Madame Bovary, c'est moi.\" Acclaimed as a masterpiece upon its publication in 1857, the work catapulted Flaubert to the ranks of the world's greatest novelists. This volume, with its fine translation by Lowell Bair, a perceptive introduction by Leo Bersani, and a complete supplement of essays and critical comments, is the indispensable <i>Madame Bovary</i>.",

    "description": "Michel Foucault has become famous for a series of books that have permanently altered our understanding of many institutions of Western society. He analyzed mental institutions in the remarkable <i>Madness and Civilization</i>; hospitals in <i>The Birth of the Clinic</i>; prisons in <i>Discipline and Punish</i>; and schools and families in <i>The History of Sexuality</i>. But the general reader as well as the specialist is apt to miss the consistent purposes that lay behind these difficult individual studies, thus losing sight of the broad social vision and political aims that unified them.<br /><br />Now, in this superb set of essays and interviews, Foucault has provided a much-needed guide to Foucault. These pieces, ranging over the entire spectrum of his concerns, enabled Foucault, in his most intimate and accessible voice, to interpret the conclusions of his research in each area and to demonstrate the contribution of each to the magnificent - and terrifying - portrait of society that he was patiently compiling.<br /><br />For, as Foucault shows, what he was always describing was the nature of power in society; not the conventional treatment of power that concentrates on powerful individuals and repressive institutions, but the much more pervasive and insidious mechanisms by which power \"reaches into the very grain of individuals, touches their bodies and inserts itself into their actions and attitudes, their discourses, learning processes and everyday lives.\"<br /><br />Foucault's investigations of prisons, schools, barracks, hospitals, factories, cities, lodgings, families, and other organized forms of social life are each a segment of one of the most astonishing intellectual enterprises of all time - and, as this book proves, one which possesses profound implications for understanding the social control of our bodies and our minds.",

    "description": "A fully illustrated oral history of the Magnetic Fields' 1999 triple album, <i>69 Love Songs</i> - an album that was afforded \"classic\" status by many almost as soon as it was released. LD Beghtol's book is chatty, incestuous, funny, dark, digressive, sexy, maddening, and delightful in equal measures. It documents a vital and influential scene from the inside, involving ukuleles and tears, citations and footnotes, analogue drum machines, and floods of cognac. Oh, and a crossword puzzle too.<br />The centre of the book is the secret history of these tuneful, acerbic, and sometimes heartbreaking songs of old love, new love, lost love, punk rock love, gay love, straight love, experimental music love, true love, blue love, and the utter lack of love that fill the album - as told by participants, fans, imitators, naysayers, and others. <br />Also included are a lexicon of words culled from the album's lyrics, recording details, performance notes from the full album shows in New York, Boston and London, plus rare and unpublished images, personal memorabilia, and much much more.",

Find the bespectacled traveler in never-before-seen illustrations, along with special stickers and a slew of other novel features.</b><br /><br />Waldo's back, and he's anxious to show you his pictures.

Now frame it, using the handy stickers at the back of the book. But your challenge is just beginning! There are hidden characters and objects to hunt for, spot-the-difference spreads, silhouettes to match with originals, and plenty more. And don't even think of cheating: virtually all the art in here is new or previously unpublished, and as maddeningly intricate as ever. Happy hunting!",

    "description": "In Gulliver's Travels, the narrator represents himself as a reliable reporter of the fantastic adventures he has just experienced. But how far can we rely on a narrator who has been impersonated by someone else? The work purports to be a travel book, and describes the shipwrecked Gulliver's encounters with the inhabitants of four extraordinary places: Lilliput, Brobdingnag, Laputa, and the country of the Houyhnhnms. An extraordinarily skillful blend of fantasy and realism makes Gulliver's Travels by turns hilarious, frightening, and profound. Swift's alter ego plays tricks on us, and our gullibility uncovers one of the world's most disturbing satires of the human condition. <br /> The fullest, most up-to-date paperback of Gulliver's Travels currently available, this new edition contains an astute analysis of the nature of Swift's satire. It includes the changing frontispiece portraits of Gulliver that appeared in successive early editions and whose subtle changes contribute to the reader's uncertainty about the veracity of the author. A new introduction by Claude Rawson draws on the latest scholarship and considers Swift's role-playing and the relationship of the author to Gulliver.",

To make matters worse, her father has just left her mother.

The charge is a lie, but the real truth about Silk would astonish even his most virulent accuser.<br /><br />Coleman Silk has a secret, one which has been kept for fifty years from his wife, his four children, his colleagues, and his friends, including the writer Nathan Zuckerman. It is Zuckerman who stumbles upon Silk's secret and sets out to reconstruct the unknown biography of this eminent, upright man, esteemed as an educator for nearly all his life, and to understand how this ingeniously contrived life came unraveled. And to understand also how Silk's astonishing private history is, in the words of the Wall Street Journal, \"magnificently\" interwoven with \"the larger public history of modern America.\"",

    "description": "The Hundred-Mile-an-Hour Dog by Jeremy Strong has become a children's classic! From The Hundred-Mile-an-Hour Dog to karate princesses and hot cross bottoms, there's a Jeremy Strong story to suit every child's sense of humour. Jeremy's readers range from 7 to teen, perfect for fans of Roald Dahl and Andy Stanton. Streaker is a mixed-up kind of dog...with quite a bit of Ferrari and a large chunk of whirlwind. Streaker is no ordinary dog. She's a rocket on four legs with a woof attached, and Trevor has got until the end of the holidays to train her. If he fails, he'll lose his bet with horrible Charlie Smugg, and something very, very yucky involving frogspawn will happen... Award-winning Jeremy Strong has written many wacky books for children aged 7-teen, including My Dad's Got an Alligator and My Brother's Famous Bottom. Most of which are illustrated by Nick Sharratt, who also illustrates for Jacqueline Wilson! The Hundred-Mile-An-Hour Dog is back causing more chaos and getting into more trouble in Return of the Hundred-Mile-An-Hour Dog, Lost! The Hundred-Mile-An-Hour Dog, Wanted! The Hundred-Mile-An-Hour Dog, Christmas Chaos for the Hundred-Mile-An-Hour Dog and The Hundred-Mile-An-Hour Dog Goes for Gold - guaranteed to have you laughing your socks off!

His love, his genius, the great beauty he has created will go on forever, enriching the world... He was a colossus... a great painter... a great philosopher... a martyr to his love of art. \"<br /><br />Walking down the streets of Paris the young Vincent Van Gogh didn't feel like he belonged. Battling poverty, repeated heartbreak and familial obligation, Van Gogh was a man plagued by his own creative urge but with no outlet to express it. Until the day he picked up a paintbrush.<br /><br />Written with raw insight and emotion, follow the artist through his tormented life, struggling against critical discouragement and mental turmoil and bare witness to his creative journey from a struggling artist to one of the world's most celebrated artists.",

    "description": "Based on a true story that stunned the world, <i>M. Butterfly</i> opens in the cramped prison cell where diplomat Rene Gallimard is being held captive by the French government - and by his own illusions. In the darkness of his cell he recalls a time when desire seemed to give him wings. A time when Song Liling, the beautiful Chinese diva, touched him with a love as vivid, as seductive - and as elusive - as a butterfly.<br /><p>How could he have known, then, that his ideal woman was, in fact, a spy for the Chinese government - and a man disguised as a woman? In a series of flashbacks, the diplomat relives the twenty-year affair from the temptation to the seduction, from its consummation to the scandal that ultimately consumed them both. But in the end, there remains only one truth: Whether or not Gallimard's passion was a flight of fancy, it sparked the most vigorous emotions of his life.<br /></p><p>Only in real life could love become so unreal. And only in such a dramatic tour de force do we learn how a fantasy can become a man's mistress - as well as his jailer. <i>M. Butterfly</i> is one of the most compelling, explosive, and slyly humorous dramas ever to light the Broadway stage, a work of unrivaled brilliance, illuminating the conflict between men and women, the differences between East and West, racial stereotypes - and the shadows we cast around our most cherished illusions.</p>",

Another son agonises over his father's deathbed confession. One daughter becomes involved in the abolition movement, while another sacrifices herself for her husband. And everyone in the tale is a dragon, red in tooth and claw. Here is a world of politics and train stations, of churchmen and family retainers, of courtship and country houses... in which, on the death of an elder, family members gather to eat the body of the deceased. In which the great and the good avail themselves of the privilege of killing and eating the weaker children, which they do with ceremony and relish, growing stronger thereby. You have never read a novel like Tooth and Claw.",

When her handsome new neighbor, Paul Chatterton, shows up on her doorstep, she tries her best to ignore his obvious charms, but his sparkling black eyes and the promise of adventure soon lure her into another investigation.<br /><br />Paul has heard rumors about Agatha's reputation as the Cotswold village sleuth and wastes no time offering their services to the crotchety owner of a haunted house. Whispers, footsteps, and a cold white mist are plaguing Mrs. Witherspoon, but the police have failed to come up with any leads, supernatural or otherwise. The neighbors think it's all a desperate ploy for attention, but Paul and Agatha are sure something more devious is going on. Someone's playing tricks on Mrs. Witherspoon, and when she turns up dead under suspicious circumstances, Agatha finds herself caught up in another baffling murder mystery.<br />",

    "description": "In <i>The Financial Expert</i>, R. K. Narayan once again transports readers to the southern Indian town of Malgudi. This story centers around the life and pursuits of Margayya, a man of many hopes but few resources, who spends his time under the banyan tree offering expert financial advice to those willing to pay for his knowledge. Margayya's rags-to-riches story brings forth the rich imagery of Indian life with the absorbing details and vivid storytelling that are Narayan's trademarks.<br /><br />\"The novels of R. K. Narayan are the best I have read in any language for a long time.\"\u2014Amit Roy, <i>Daily Telegraph</i><br /><br />\"The experience of reading one of his novels is . . . comparable to one's first reaction to the great Russian novels: the fresh realization of the common humanity of all peoples.\"\u2014Margaret Parton, <i>New York Herald Tribune Book Review</i><br /><br />\"The hardest of all things for a novelist to communicate is the extraordinary ordinariness of most human happiness. . . . Jane Austen, Soseki, Chekhov: a few bring it off. Narayan is one of them.\"\u2014Francis King, <i>Spectator</i><br /><br />",

    "description": "A parable of the highest order, <i>The Plague</i> tells the story of a terrible disease that descends upon Oran, Algiers, in a year unknown. After rats crawl from the sewer to die in the streets, people soon begin perishing from terrible afflictions. How the main characters in the book--a journalist, a doctor and a priest--face humanity in the wake of the plague presents one of the book's many lessons. The book deserves to be read on several levels, because the pandemic in <i>The Plague</i> represents any of a number of worldwide catastrophes--both past and future--and the difficult choices everyone must make to survive them.",

    "description": "Nathaniel is a boy magician-in-training, sold to the government by his birth parents at the age of five and sent to live as an apprentice to a master. Powerful magicians rule Britain, and its empire, and Nathaniel is told his is the \"ultimate sacrifice\" for a \"noble destiny.\" <br /><br />If leaving his parents and erasing his past life isn't tough enough, Nathaniel's master, Arthur Underwood, is a cold, condescending, and cruel middle-ranking magician in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The boy's only saving grace is the master's wife, Martha Underwood, who shows him genuine affection that he rewards with fierce devotion. Nathaniel gets along tolerably well over the years in the Underwood household until the summer before his eleventh birthday. Everything changes when he is publicly humiliated by the ruthless magician Simon Lovelace and betrayed by his cowardly master who does not defend him.<br /><br />Nathaniel vows revenge. In a Faustian fever, he devours magical texts and hones his magic skills, all the while trying to appear subservient to his master. When he musters the strength to summon the 5,000-year-old djinni Bartimaeus to avenge Lovelace by stealing the powerful Amulet of Samarkand, the boy magician plunges into a situation more dangerous and deadly than anything he could ever imagine.",

Well, if you don't know yet you'd better find out quickly-because there's nothing a witch loathes quite as much as children and she'll wield all kinds of terrifying powers to get rid of them.",

    "description": "Fiendishly devious and addictively readable, Peter Carey\u2019s <b>My Life as a Fake</b> is a moral labyrinth constructed around the uneasy relationship between literature and lying. In steamy, fetid Kuala Lumpur in 1972, Sarah Wode-Douglass, the editor of a London poetry journal, meets a mysterious Australian named Christopher Chubb. Chubb is a despised literary hoaxer, carting around a manuscript likely filled with deceit. But in this dubious manuscript Sarah recognizes a work of real genius. But whose genius? As Sarah tries to secure the manuscript, Chubb draws her into a fantastic story of imposture, murder, kidnapping, and exile\u2013a story that couldn\u2019t be true unless its teller were mad. <b>My Life as a Fake</b> is Carey at his most audacious and entertaining.",

    "description": "<i>The System of the World,</i> the third and concluding volume of Neal Stephenson's shelf-bending Baroque Cycle (<i>Quicksilver</i> and <i>The Confusion</i>), brings the epic historical saga to its thrilling - and truly awe-inspiring - conclusion.<br /><br />Set in the early 18th century and featuring a diverse cast of characters that includes alchemists, philosophers, mathematicians, spies, thieves, pirates, and royalty, <i>The System of the World</i> follows Daniel Waterhouse, an unassuming philosopher and confidant to some of the most brilliant minds of the age, as he returns to England to try and repair the rift between geniuses Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. After reluctantly leaving his family in Boston, Waterhouse arrives in England and is almost killed by a mysterious Infernal Device. Having been away from the war-decimated country for two decades, Waterhouse quickly learns that although many things have changed, there is still violent revolution simmering just beneath the surface of seemingly civilized society. With Queen Anne deathly ill and Tories and Whigs jostling for political supremacy, Waterhouse and Newton vow to figure out who is trying to kill certain scientists and decipher the riddle behind the legend of King Solomon's gold, a mythical hoard of precious metal with miraculous properties.<br /><br />Arguably one of the most ambitious -- and most researched -- stories ever written, Stephenson's Baroque Cycle is set in one of the most turbulent and exciting times in human history. Filled with wild adventure, political intrigue, social upheaval, civilization-changing discoveries, cabalistic mysticism, and even a little romance, this massive saga is worth its weight in (Solomon's) gold. <br /><i>Paul Goat Allen</i>",

    "description": "The Forums (David and Polly, and the children Myra, Sebastian, Wolfgang and Ethel) live in a house called Apple Bough, and are a very musical family. David is a pianist, and considered one of the best accompanists in the country. Polly had been training to be a professional singer before her marriage: after her marriage she gave up training, and became an artist.<br /><br />All of the children can play the piano nicely, but Myra, Wolfgang and Ethel are \"born amateurs\". Sebastian plays remarkably well, but there seems to be something missing. However, when he is four David and Polly realise that the violin is his instrument, and he begins taking lessons, and practising up to four hours a day. Because of his violin lessons, Sebastian cannot go to a normal school, so David and Polly engage a governess to teach all the children - Miss Popple, who soon becomes known as Popps.<br /><br />At the suggestion of his violin teacher, David and Polly allow Sebastian to play at a musicians' charity event when he is eight. As a result of this, an important American concert arranger makes an offer for Sebastian to tour America, accompanied by his father. The tour will finish in California, where a great violin master lives: the income from the tour will be enough to pay for lessons. At first Polly refuses, not wanting to break up the family. However, a new offer is made, for the whole family, and Miss Popple, to travel with Sebastian. David and Polly think this will be a wonderful experience for the children, so they agree. Apple Bough is sold, Myra's dog, Wag, is left with Miss Popple's brother, and the family set off for America.<br /><br />One tour is followed by another, and after four years the family has travelled around North and South America, Japan, Australia, and Europe, but they have not been back to England. By this time, the children and Miss Popple are getting tired of travelling: Myra misses Wag, Ethel wants to be a student at the Royal Ballet School, and Wolfgang feels \"it's as if Sebastian was a dog and we were his tail\" <br /><br />When Sebastian turns twelve, he is able to perform in England. Before his first concert, Myra, Wolfgang and Ethel have a holiday with their grandparents, and it is from a conversation with Grandfather that \"Operation Home\" is born.",

    "description": "Science and art have in common intense seeing, the wide-eyed observing that generates visual information. <i>Beautiful Evidence</i> is about how seeing turns into showing, how data and evidence turn into explanation. The book identifies excellent and effective methods for showing nearly every kind of information, suggests many new designs (including sparklines), and provides analytical tools for assessing the credibility of evidence presentations (which are seen from both sides: how to produce and how to consume presentations). For alert consumers of presentations, there are chapters on diagnosing evidence corruption and PowerPoint pitches. <i>Beautiful Evidence</i> concludes with two chapters that leave the world of pixel and paper flatland representations - and move onto seeing and thinking in space land, the real-land of three-space and time.",

    "description": "Beginning with a discussion of familiar images of the French Revolution, garnered from Dickens, Baroness Orczy, and Tolstoy, as well as the legends of let them eat cake, and tricolours, Doyle leads the reader to the realization that we are still living with developments and consequences of the French Revolution such as decimalization, and the whole ideology of human rights. Continuing with a brief survey of the old regime and how it collapsed, Doyle continues to ellucidate how the revolution happened: why did the revolutionaries quarrel with the king, the church and the rest of Europe, why this produced Terror, and finally how it accomplished rule by a general. The revolution destroyed the age-old cultural, institutional and social structures in France and beyond. This book looks at how the ancien regime became ancien as well as examining cases in which achievement failed to match ambition. Doyle explores the legacy of the revolution in the form of rationality in public affairs and responsible government, and finishes his examination of the revolution with a discussion of why it has been so controversial.<br /><br /><strong>About the Series: </strong>Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.<br />",

    "description": "A family without men, the Birches live gloriously offbeat lives in the lush, green backwoods of North Carolina. Radiant, headstrong Sophia and her shy, brilliant daughter, Margaret, possess powerful charms to ward off loneliness, despair, and the human misery that often beats a path to their door. And they are protected by the eccentric wisdom and muscular love of the remarkable matriarch Charlie Kate, a solid, uncompromising, self-taught healer who treats everything from boils to broken bones to broken hearts.<br /><br />Sophia, Margaret, and Charlie Kate find strength in a time when women almost always depended on men, and their bond deepens as each one experiences love and loss during World War II. <strong>Charms for the Easy Life</strong> is a passionate, luminous, and exhilarating story about embracing what life has to offer ... even if it means finding it in unconventional ways.<br /><br />This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.",

    "description": "Fresh on the heels of his <b>New York Times</b> bestselling and National Book Award-nominated novel, <b>Drop City</b>, T.C. Boyle has spun an even more dazzling tale that will delight both his longtime devotees and a legion of new fans. Boyle\u2019s tenth novel, <b>The Inner Circle</b> has it all: fabulous characters, a rollicking plot, and more sex than pioneering researcher Dr. Alfred Kinsey ever dreamed of documenting . . . well, almost.A love story, <b>The Inner Circle</b> is narrated by John Milk, a virginal young man who in 1940 accepts a job as an assistant to Dr. Alfred Kinsey, an extraordinarily charming professor of zoology at Indiana University who has just discovered hislife\u2019s true calling: sex. As a member of Kinsey\u2019s \u201cinner circle\u201d of researchers, Milk (and his beautiful new wife) is called on to participate in sexual experiments that become increasingly uninhibited\u2014and problematic for his marriage. For in his later years Kinsey (who behind closed doors is a sexual enthusiast of the first order) ever more recklessly pushed the boundaries both personally and professionally.<br /><br />While Boyle doesn\u2019t resist making the most of this delicious material, <b>The Inner Circle</b> is at heart a very moving and very loving look at sex, marriage, and jealousy that will have readers everywhere reassessing their own relationships\u2014because, in the end, \u201clove is all there is.\u201d",

She's the heroine, and her story is exciting -- but that's the trouble. Her story is always exciting in the same way. Sylvie longs to get away and explore the world outside the confines of her book. <p> When she breaks the cardinal rule of all storybook characters and looks up at the Reader, Sylvie begins a journey that not even she could have anticipated. And what she accomplishes goes beyond any great good thing she could have imagined...</p>",

Boy is the story of Roald Dahl's very own boyhood, including tales of sweet-shops and chocolate, mean old ladies and a Great Mouse Plot - the inspiration for some of his most marvellous storybooks in the years to come. Going Solo tells of how, when he grew up, Roald Dahl left England for Africa and later went flying with the Royal Air Force, before he became the world's number-one storyteller. You can listen to all of Roald Dahl's stories on Puffin Audiobooks, read by some very famous voices, including Kate Winslet, David Walliams and Steven Fry - plus there are added squelchy soundeffects from Pinewood Studios! Also look out for new Roald Dahl apps in the App store and Google Play- including the disgusting TWIT OR MISS! and HOUSE OF TWITS inspired by the revolting Twits.",

    "description": "Designers are quick to tell us about their sources of inspiration, but they are much less willing to reveal such critical matters as how to find work, how much they charge, and what to do when a client rejects three weeks of work and refuses to pay the bill. <i>How to be a graphic designer without losing your soul</i> addresses the concerns of young designers who want to earn a living by doing expressive and meaningful work, and who want to avoid becoming hired drones working on soulless projects. Written by a designer for designers, it combines practical advice with philosophical guidance to help young professionals embark on their careers. How should designers manage the creative process? What's the first step in the successful interpretation of a brief? How do you generate ideas when everything just seems blank? How to be a graphic designer offers clear, concise guidance for these questions, along with focused, no-nonsense strategies for setting up, running, and promoting a studio, finding work, and collaborating with clients.<br /><br />The book also includes inspiring interviews with ten leading designers, including Rudy VanderLans (<i>Emigre</i>), John Warwicker (Tomato), Neville Brody (Research Studios), and Andy Cruz (House Industries). All told, <i>How to be a graphic designer</i> covers just about every aspect of the profession, and stands as an indispensable guide for any young designer.",

    "description": "<b>De una de las nadadoras profesionales m</b>\u00e1<b>s destacadas del mundo nos llega este maravilloso relato, sobre el poder de la fe que supera todos los obst</b>\u00e1<b>culos</b>En <i>Grayson</i>, Lynne Cox narra la historia de un milagroso e inolvidable encuentro que vivi\u00f3 en el mar a los diecisiete a\u00f1os. En una madrugada serena pero cargada de energ\u00eda, Lynne nadaba en aguas fr\u00edas, a doscientos metros de la costa, cuando se percat\u00f3 de que algo nadaba por debajo de ella. Aquello parec\u00eda lo bastante grande como para ser un tibur\u00f3n blanco, pero no lo fue. Result\u00f3 ser un beb\u00e9 ballena que hab\u00eda perdido a su mam\u00e1 en el mar, y que hab\u00eda seguido a Lynne por m\u00e1s de una milla. Si Lynne no lograba encontrar a la mam\u00e1, el beb\u00e9 ballena se deshidratar\u00eda y morir\u00eda de hambre. Algo tan enorme como la mam\u00e1 ballena, que med\u00eda quince metros, de pronto parec\u00eda muy peque\u00f1a en el vasto oc\u00e9ano Pac\u00edfico. \u00bfC\u00f3mo podr\u00eda encontrarla Lynne?",

Drawing on the latest discoveries about human evolution and about our closest living relatives, the great apes, Demonic Males offers some startling new answers. Dramatic, vivid, and firmly grounded in meticulous research, this book will change the way you see the world. As the San Francisco Chronicle said, it \"dares to dig for the roots of a contentious and complicated subject that makes up much of our daily news.\"",

    "description": "One of the best-loved of Nabokov\u2019s novels, <i>Pnin</i> features his funniest and most heart-rending character. Professor Timofey Pnin is a haplessly disoriented Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 precariously employed on an American college campus in the 1950s. Pnin struggles to maintain his dignity through a series of comic and sad misunderstandings, all the while falling victim both to subtle academic conspiracies and to the manipulations of a deliberately unreliable narrator.<br /><br />Initially an almost grotesquely comic figure, Pnin gradually grows in stature by contrast with those who laugh at him. Whether taking the wrong train to deliver a lecture in a language he has not mastered or throwing a faculty party during which he learns he is losing his job, the gently preposterous hero of this enchanting novel evokes the reader\u2019s deepest protective instinct.<br /><br />Serialized in <i>The New Yorker</i> and published in book form in 1957, <i>Pnin</i> brought Nabokov both his first National Book Award nomination and hitherto unprecedented popularity.",

But Foo is still in chaos, and Leven must overcome several adversaries and survive the Swollen Forest in order to save his friends and keep hope alive. As fate would have it, nothing goes as planned, and even Geth begins to wonder if they will succeed. Bad goes to worse as Leven digs up a long buried secret--one that stalks him, determined to whisper a truth that could be deadly in the wrong hands. Through it all, Leven finds the courage to do what is right and continues to discover an inner strength and a power he never thought possible.",

Heathcliff becomes torn between love for Catherine and the rage and humiliation he suffers. Finally he can stand it no longer and, in the violence of a summer storm, leaves the Heights for three years. During his absence Catherine has married, but her tormented heart belongs eternally to Heathcliff who is now prepared to exact his tyrannical revenge.<br /><br />With its freedom from social convention and its unparalleled emotional intensity, <i>Wuthering Heights</i> is a highly original and deeply tragic work.",

    "description": "This remarkable book is Eva Hoffman's personal story of her experiences as an emigre who loses and remakes her identity in a new land and translates her sense of self into a new culture and a different language.<br /><br />The condition of exile is an exaggeration of the process of change and loss that many people experience as they grow and mature, leaving behind the innocence of childhood. Eva Hoffman spent her early years in Cracow, among family friends who, like her parents, had escaped the Holocaust and were skeptical of the newly imposed Communist state. Hoffman's parents managed to immigrate to Canada in the 1950s, where Eva was old enough to feel like a stranger--bland food, a quieter life, and schoolmates who hardly knew where Poland was. Still, there were neighbors who knew something of Old World ways, and a piano teacher who was classically Middle European in his neurotic enthusiasm for music. Her true exile came in college in Texas, where she found herself among people who were frightened by and hostile to her foreignness. Later, at Harvard, Hoffman found herself initially alienated by her burgeoning intellectualism; her parents found it difficult to comprehend. Her sense of perpetual otherness was extended by encounters with childhood friends who had escaped Cracow to grow up in Israel, rather than Canada or the United States, and were preoccupied with soldiers, not scholars. Lost in Translation is a moving memoir that takes the specific experience of the exile and humanizes it to such a degree that it becomes relevant to the lives of a wider group of readers.",

    "description": "Polly Platt's title French or Foe? is more timely than ever, as the Franco. American alliance frays a little more with each day, the exchanges more vitriolic than ever before. Her book has long been the reference for what it is about the French that rubs Americans the wrong way, why the Franco-American alliance has difficulties, and how to handle French people.... and find out, she says, \"how wonderful they are.\" Now in the third edition, she examines the revolution of the last few years brought about by the computer and the Internet. Interviews with many American and French executives explain the differences .. and the similarities .. in procedures in the work place compared five years ago. In addition, French or Foe?'s third edition describes the \"French exceptions\" of the last few years: the Messier scandal, the reasons why France was voted the Workers' Paradise in 2002; the romantic Look, version 2003; the government's new measures to combat the number of road deaths and to reduce smoking; the new Mayor's campaign against dog poop and his transforming of the banks of the Seine into Paris Plage, a beach resort; the havoc wrought by the hurricanes at Christmas 2000. The third edition tells what happened to various French heroes such as Jean-Paul Belmondo and Yves Saint Laurent and describes events like the reburial of Alexandre Dumas in the Pantheon, the French hall of fame. It portrays the success of determined French individuals, from Eric Srecki, world fencing champion, to Peggy Bouchet, the first woman to row across the Atlantic, and the rocker Johnnie Halliday, who gave the biggest concert ever organized in France in the Stade de France, one year after the greatest celebration ofall..... when the French won the soccer World Cup there in 1998, in one of the country's most exciting and dramatic national triumphs. The addition of an Index makes this third edition one that everyone will want to have in their library.",

To music lover Jancee, New York City was a foreign country. So it was with bleak expectations that she submitted her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine. And before she knew it, she was backstage and behind the scenes with the most famous people in the world\u2014hiking in Canada with Brad Pitt, snacking on Velveeta with Dolly Parton, dancing drunkenly onstage with the Beastie Boys\u2014trading her good-girl suburban past for late nights, hipster guys, and the booze-soaked rock 'n' roll life. </p> <p> Riotously funny and tremendously touching, <i>But Enough About Me</i> is the amazing true story of an outsider who couldn't quite bring herself to become an insider. </p>",

Both Malory and Dana had taken their turns. The final, and last, test goes to Zoe McCourt - valor.<br /><br />Now it was her burden, her risk. Her chance. She had to be brave enough, smart enough, strong enough, or everything they'd done before her would be for nothing.<br /><br />Zoe has the courage to raise her young son alone, and to face all the adversity life has thrown at them. But will she have the courage to face a foe determined to do anything to stop the third key from being found - even destroying everything - and everyone - she loves?",

The\u00a0\u00a0recollection of the narrator's love for Swann's daughter Gilberte leads to an account\u00a0\u00a0of Swann's passion for Odette and the rise of the nouveaux riches Verdurins. <br /><br />The final volume of a new, definitive text of <i>A la recherche du temps perdu</i> was published by the Bibliotheque de la Pleiade in 1989. For this authoritative English-language edition, D. J. Enright has revised the late Terence Kilmartin's acclaimed reworking of C. K. Scott Moncrieff's translation to take into account the new French editions.",

          "description": "With <b>\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu</b> / <b>In Search of Lost Time</b> Proust attempted the perfect rendering of life in art, of the past recreated through memory. It is both a portrait of the artist and a discovery of the aesthetic by which the portrait is painted, and it was to have an immense influence on the literature of the twentieth century.\n    \n    The novel contains seven volumes:\n    <b>1 - Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de chez Swann</b> (1913): Swann's Way / The Way by Swann's\n    (Part I: Combray / Overture. Part II: Un Amour de Swann / Swann in Love. Part III : Noms de pays: le nom / Names of places: the name)\n    <b>2 - \u00c0 l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs</b> (1919): In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower / Within a Budding Grove\n    <b>3 - Le C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Guermantes</b> (1920-1921): The Guermantes Way \n    <b>4 - Sodome et Gomorrhe</b> (1921-1922): Sodom and Gomorrah / Cities of the Plain\n    <b>5 - La Prisonni\u00e8re</b> (1923): The Prisoner / The Captive\n    <b>6 - Albertine disparue / La Fugitive</b> (1925): Albertine Gone / The Fugitive / The Sweet Cheat Gone\n    <b>7 - Le Temps retrouv\u00e9</b> (1927): Time Regained / The Past Recaptured / Finding Time Again\n    \n    The novel is being adapted as a <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/65593-remembrance-of-things-past-graphic-novel-adaptation\">graphic novel</a> by [author:St\u00e9phane Heuet|119580].\n    \n    <b>In Search of Lost Time</b> is Marcel Proust\u2019s masterpiece, known for its length and the notion of involuntary memory, the most famous example being the \"episode of the madeleine\". The complete story contains nearly 1.5 million words and is one of the longest novels in world literature.\n    \n    <b>\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu</b> is translated as:\n    English: In Search of Lost Time / Remembrance of Things Past*\n    Spanish: En busca del tiempo perdido\n    German: Auf der Suche nach der verlorenen Zeit\n    Portugese: Em Busca do Tempo Perdido\n    Italian: Alla ricerca del tempo perduto\n    Dutch: Op zoek naar de verloren tijd\n    Swedish: P\u00e5 spaning efter den tid som flytt\n    Polish: W poszukiwaniu straconego czasu\n    Turkish: Kay\u0131p Zaman\u0131n \u0130zinde\n    Bulgarian: \u041f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0433\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\n    *In English the novel is widely referred to as <b>Remembrance of Things Past</b> but the title <b>In Search of Lost Time</b>, a literal rendering of the French, has gained in usage since D.J. Enright's adopted it in his 1992 revision of the earlier translation by C.K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin.",

    "description": "One of the world\u2019s most influential philosophers here considers the ethical issues surrounding globalization. Peter Singer discusses climate change, the role of the World Trade Organization, human rights and humanitarian intervention, and foreign aid, showing how a global ethic rather than a nationalistic approach can provide illuminating answers to important problems.<br /><br />The book encompasses four main global issues: climate change, the role of the World Trade Organization, human rights and humanitarian intervention, and foreign aid. Singer addresses each vital issue from an ethical perspective and offers alternatives to the state-centric approach that characterizes international theory and relations today. Posing a bold challenge to narrow or nationalistic views, Singer presents a realistic, new way of looking at contemporary global issues\u2014through a prism of ethics.<br />",

    "description": "Cokie Roberts's number one <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, <em>We Are Our Mothers' Daughters</em>, examined the nature of women's roles throughout history and led <em>USA Today</em> to praise her as a \"custodian of time-honored values.\" Her second bestseller, <em>From This Day Forward</em>, written with her husband, Steve Roberts, described American marriages throughout history, including the romance of John and Abigail Adams. Now Roberts returns with <em>Founding Mothers</em>, an intimate and illuminating look at the fervently patriotic and passionate women whose tireless pursuits on behalf of their families -- and their country -- proved just as crucial to the forging of a new nation as the rebellion that established it.<br /><br />While much has been written about the men who signed the Declaration of Independence, battled the British, and framed the Constitution, the wives, mothers, sisters, and daughters they left behind have been little noticed by history. Roberts brings us the women who fought the Revolution as valiantly as the men, often defending their very doorsteps. While the men went off to war or to Congress, the women managed their businesses, raised their children, provided them with political advice, and made it possible for the men to do what they did. The behind-the-scenes influence of these women -- and their sometimes very public activities -- was intelligent and pervasive.<br /><br />Drawing upon personal correspondence, private journals, and even favored recipes, Roberts reveals the often surprising stories of these fascinating women, bringing to life the everyday trials and extraordinary triumphs of individuals like Abigail Adams, Mercy Otis Warren, Deborah Read Franklin, Eliza Pinckney, Catherine Littlefield Green, Esther DeBerdt Reed, and Martha Washington -- proving that without our exemplary women, the new country might never have survived.<br /><br />Social history at its best, <em>Founding Mothers</em> unveils the drive, determination, creative insight, and passion of the other patriots, the women who raised our nation. Roberts proves beyond a doubt that like every generation of American women that has followed, the founding mothers used the unique gifts of their gender -- courage, pluck, sadness, joy, energy, grace, sensitivity, and humor -- to do what women do best, put one foot in front of the other in remarkable circumstances and carry on.",

Drawn into a netherworld of rituals and celebrations, Davis penetrated the vodoun mystique deeply enough to place zombification in its proper context within vodoun culture. In the course of his investigation, Davis came to realize that the story of vodoun is the history of Haiti\u2014from the African origins of its people to the successful Haitian independence movement, down to the present day, where vodoun culture is, in effect, the government of Haiti\u2019s countryside. <br /><br /><i>The Serpent and the Rainbow</i> combines anthropological investigation with a remarkable personal adventure to illuminate and finally explain a phenomenon that has long fascinated Americans.",

AND A SUMMER APART ...<br /><br />We, the Sisterhood, hereby instate the following rules to govern the use of the Traveling Pants:<br /><br />1. You must never wash the Pants.<br /><br />2. You must never double-cuff the Pants. It's tacky. There will never be a time when this will not be tacky.<br /><br />3. You must never say the word \"phat\" while wearing the Pants. You must also never think \"I am fat\" while wearing the Pants.<br /><br />4. You must never let a boy take off the Pants (although you may take them off yourself in his presence).<br /><br />5. You must not pick your nose while wearing the Pants. You may, however, scratch casually at your nostril while really kind of picking.<br /><br />6. Upon our reunion, you must follow the proper procedures for documenting your time in the Pants.<br /><br />7. You must write to your Sisters throughout the summer, no matter how much fun you are having without them.<br /><br />8. You must pass the Pants along to your Sister according to the specifications set down by the Sisterhood. Failures to comply will result in a sever spanking upon our reunion.<br /><br />9. You must not wear the Pants with a tucked-in shirt and belt. See rule #2.<br /><br />10. Remember: Pants = love. Love your pals. Love yourself.",

    "description": "Many advertisements these days make us feel as if we have an intimate, even passionate relationship with a product. But as Jean Kilbourne points out in this fascinating and shocking expose, the dreamlike promise of advertising always leaves us hungry for more. We can never be satisfied, because the products we love cannot love us back.<br /><br />\"When was the last time you felt this comfortable in a relationship?\"; An ad for sneakers.<br /><br />\"You can love it without getting your heart broken.\"; An ad for a car.<br /><br />\"Until I find a real man, I'll settle for a real smoke.\"; A woman in a cigarette ad.<br /><br />Drawing upon her knowledge of psychology, media, and women's issues, Kilbourne offers nothing less than a new understanding of a ubiquitous phenomenon in our culture. The average American is exposed to over 3,000 advertisements a day and watches three years' worth of television ads over the course of a lifetime. Kilbourne paints a gripping portrait of how this barrage of advertising drastically affects young people, especially girls, by offering false promises of rebellion, connection, and control. She also offers a surprising analysis of the way advertising creates and then feeds an addictive mentality that often continues throughout adulthood.",

    "description": "<b>One of the 20th Century's most beloved novels is still winning hearts! </b><br /><i></i><br /><i>I Capture the Castle</i> tells the story of seventeen-year-old Cassandra and her family, who live in not-so-genteel poverty in a ramshackle old English castle. Here she strives, over six turbulent months, to hone her writing skills. She fills three notebooks with sharply funny yet poignant entries. Her journals candidly chronicle the great changes that take place within the castle's walls, and her own first descent into love. By the time she pens her final entry, she has \"captured the castle\"-- and the heart of the reader-- in one of literature's most enchanting entertainments.<br /><br />\u201cThis book has one of the most charismatic narrators I've ever met.\u201d -- <i>J.K.

    "description": "Billy Collins can pack the house. Funny and laid-back, his clear, often brief poems are easy to understand and enjoy -- which is why his readings are sometimes standing-room-only affairs. Collins may be a college professor and NEA-grant recipient, but he's not above using a disinfectant ad as an epigraph. <br /><p><br />\"Public restrooms give me the willies,\" reads the epigraph to a poem appropriately titled \"The Willies.\" That man-on-the-street brand of humor, utterly stripped of academic pretense, is trademark Collins. <br /></p><p><br />QUESTIONS ABOUT ANGELS, a reissue of Collins's fourth volume of poems, offers 70 pages of well-formed, very American verse that -- not surprisingly -- doesn't require a shelf of dictionaries. In fact, just as he laughs at epigraphs, Collins gleefully pokes fun at the very concept of dictionaries. Here, for example, are the opening lines to \"The Hunt,\" which initially offer the flowing, dreamy verse many expect from a poet:<br /></p><p> <br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Somewhere in the rolling hills and farm country<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that lie beyond speech<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Noah Webster and his assistants are moving<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0across the landscape tracking down a new word.<br /></p><p><br />Then Collins really gets going, letting his claws dig in. In the next stanza, that trademark humor really shows:<br /></p><p><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is a small noun about the size of a mouse, <br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0one that will seldom be used by anyone, <br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0like a synonym for isthmus<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0but they are pursuing the creature zealously<br /></p><p><br />Collins could be talking about poetry itself, a form \"zealously pursued\" but too often \"seldom used.\" Despite the deadpan tone, these are poems that are aware of poetic tradition. QUESTIONS ABOUT ANGELS opens with a poem called \"American Sonnet,\" which announces that \"We do not speak like Petrarch or wear a hat like Spenser.\" Collins seems to believe that his particular American landscape and culture requires a variation on the standard forms of Western tradition. This country, he seems to say, demands a rethinking of it all.<br /></p><p><br />Part of that rethinking is a probe of the whole idea of a \"poet.\" Collins asks the questions his students would love to ask, if they only had the guts. How, he asks, do you know for sure if a poet is contemporary? This, of course, is a twist on the earlier, unspoken-but-understood question of \"What makes a sonnet a sonnet, anyway?\" addressed in the first poem.<br /></p><p><br />Just as he produced an American \"sonnet\" that rolls off the tongue with the ease of banter, Collins comes up with an American, can-do answer to the \"who's a contemporary poet?\" question: <br /></p><p><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is easy to find out if a poet is a contemporary poet<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and thus avoid the imbroglio of calling him Victorian<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0or worse, Elizabethan, or worse, medieval.<br /><br /></p><p><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you look him up in The Norton Anthology of English Literature<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and the year of his birth is followed only by a dash<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and a small space for the numerals only spirits know, <br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0then it is safe to say that he is probably alive<br /><br /></p><p><br />Though clothed in simple words and humor, Collins is actually taking a pretty sophisticated jab in these two stanzas, which are the first part of the appropriately titled poem \"The Norton Anthology of English Literature.\" Is a poet worthy simply because he is in the anthology? And do these omnipresent anthologies really define periods and countries? Coming just a few pages after the Noah Webster reference, Collins may also be pushing his readers to wonder about the anthologizers' research processes.<br /></p><p><br />Collins loves to mix poems to history's overachievers with odes to underachievers or family pets who never seemed to have much, if any, ambition. In one of the book's sweeter poems, Collins offers praise of a character named Riley. Here's the last stanza of the very brief poem \"The Life of Riley: A Definitive Biography,\" where yet again, Collins mixes the quotidian and the poetic, letting his linguistic ability peep through the everyman persona at key moments:<br /></p><p><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He never had a job, a family or a sore throat. <br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He never mowed a lawn. <br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Passersby would always stop to remind him<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whose life it was he was living. <br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He died in a hammock weighing a cloud.<br /></p><p><br />In a book that mentions weighing a dog and stripping layers of clothing off as he writes, it makes sense that this poet doesn't flinch from depicting the weighing of a cloud. Like the character who never had a sore throat, Collins writes glitch-free poems that are both a breeze and a blast to read.<br /></p><p>\n  <br /><i>--Aviya Kushner</i>\n</p>",
