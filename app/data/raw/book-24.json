    "description": "Moral thinking pervades our practical lives, but where did this way of thinking come from, and what purpose does it serve? Is it to be explained by environmental pressures on our ancestors a million years ago, or is it a cultural invention of more recent origin? In <i>The Evolution of Morality</i>, Richard Joyce takes up these controversial questions, finding that the evidence supports an innate basis to human morality. As a moral philosopher, Joyce is interested in whether any implications follow from this hypothesis. Might the fact that the human brain has been biologically prepared by natural selection to engage in moral judgment serve in some sense to vindicate this way of thinking -- staving off the threat of moral skepticism, or even undergirding some version of moral realism? Or if morality has an adaptive explanation in genetic terms -- if it is, as Joyce writes, \"just something that helped our ancestors make more babies\" -- might such an explanation actually undermine morality's central role in our lives? He carefully examines both the evolutionary \"vindication of morality\" and the evolutionary \"debunking of morality,\" considering the skeptical view more seriously than have others who have treated the subject.<br /><br />Interdisciplinary and combining the latest results from the empirical sciences with philosophical discussion, <i>The Evolution of Morality</i> is one of the few books in this area written from the perspective of moral philosophy. Concise and without technical jargon, the arguments are rigorous but accessible to readers from different academic backgrounds. Joyce discusses complex issues in plain language while advocating subtle and sometimes radical views. <i>The Evolution of Morality</i> lays the philosophical foundations for further research into the biological understanding of human morality.",

    "description": "<p>\"It's the animal in us,\" we often hear when we've been bad. But why not when we're good? <i>Primates and Philosophers</i> tackles this question by exploring the biological foundations of one of humanity's most valued traits: morality.</p><p>In this provocative book, primatologist Frans de Waal argues that modern-day evolutionary biology takes far too dim a view of the natural world, emphasizing our \"selfish\" genes. Science has thus exacerbated our reciprocal habits of blaming nature when we act badly and labeling the good things we do as \"humane.\" Seeking the origin of human morality not in evolution but in human culture, science insists that we are moral by choice, not by nature.</p><p>Citing remarkable evidence based on his extensive research of primate behavior, de Waal attacks \"Veneer Theory,\" which posits morality as a thin overlay on an otherwise nasty nature. He explains how we evolved from a long line of animals that care for the weak and build cooperation with reciprocal transactions. Drawing on both Darwin and recent scientific advances, de Waal demonstrates a strong continuity between human and animal behavior. In the process, he also probes issues such as anthropomorphism and human responsibilities toward animals.</p><p>Based on the Tanner Lectures de Waal delivered at Princeton University's Center for Human Values in 2004, <i>Primates and Philosophers</i> includes responses by the philosophers Peter Singer, Christine M. Korsgaard, and Philip Kitcher and the science writer Robert Wright. They press de Waal to clarify the differences between humans and other animals, yielding a lively debate that will fascinate all those who wonder about the origins and reach of human goodness.<br /><br />The University Center for Human Values Series.</p>",

Paradoxically, among many black people it has become a term of affection and even empowerment. The word, of course, is <i>nigger</i>, and in this candid, lucidly argued book the distinguished legal scholar Randall Kennedy traces its origins, maps its multifarious connotations, and explores the controversies that rage around it.<br /><br />Should blacks be able to use <i>nigger</i> in ways forbidden to others? Should the law treat it as a provocation that reduces the culpability of those who respond to it violently? Should it cost a person his job, or a book like <b>Huckleberry Finn</b> its place on library shelves? With a range of reference that extends from the Jim Crow south to Chris Rock routines and the O. J. Simpson trial, Kennedy takes on not just a word, but our laws, attitudes, and culture with bracing courage and intelligence.",

The professor swears it's a Vermeer -- but why exactly has he kept it hidden so long? The reasons unfold in a gripping sequence of stories that trace ownership of the work back to Amsterdam during World War II and still further to the moment of the painting's inception.",

    "description": "A story about dirt--and about sun, water, work, elation, and defeat. And about the sublime pleasure of having a little piece of French land all to oneself to till.<br /><br /> Richard Goodman saw the ad in the paper: \"SOUTHERN FRANCE: Stone house in Village near Nimes/Avignon/Uzes. 4 BR, 2 baths, fireplace, books, desk, bikes. Perfect for writing, painting, exploring &amp; experiencing la France profonde. $450 mo. plus utilities.\" And, with his girlfriend, he left New York City to spend a year in Southern France.<br /><br /> The village was small--no shops, no gas station, no post office, only a caf\u00e9 and a school. St. Sebastien de Caisson was home to farmers and vintners. Every evening Goodman watched the villagers congregate and longed to be a part of their camaraderie. But they weren't interested in him: he was just another American, come to visit and soon to leave. So Goodman laced up his work boots and ventured out into the vineyards to work among them. He met them first as a hired worker, and then as a farmer of his own small plot of land.<br /><br /> French Dirt is a love story between a man and his garden. It's about plowing, planting, watering, and tending. It's about cabbage, tomatoes, parsley, and eggplant. Most of all, it's about the growing friendship between an American outsider and a close-knit community of French farmers.<br /><br /> \"There's a genuine sweetness about the way the cucumbers and tomatoes bridge the divide of nationality.\"--The New York Times Book Review<br /><br /> \"One of the most charming, perceptive and subtle books ever written about the French by an American.\"--San Francisco Chronicle",

    "description": "<i>\"Adventure beyond our Earth - beautifully coloured and shaped.\"</i> - The Times <br /><br /><i>\"This book has real splendour, compelling moments and a flowing narrative.\"</i> - The New York Times <br /><br />Written during the dark hours immediately before and during the Second World War, C.S. Lewis's Space Trilogy, of which <i>Out of the Silent Planet</i> is the first volume, stands alongside such works as Albert Camus's <i>The Plague</i> and George Orwell's <i>1984 </i>as a timely parable that has become timeless, beloved by succeeding generations as much for the sheer wonder of its storytelling as for the significance of the moral concerns. For the trilogy's central figure, C.S. Lewis created perhaps the most memorable character of his career, the brilliant, clear-eyed, and fiercely brave philologist Dr. Elwin Ransom. Appropriately, Lewis modeled Dr. Ransom after his dear friend J.R.R. Tolkien, for in the scope of its imaginative achievement and the totality of its vision of not one but two imaginary worlds, the Space Trilogy is rivaled in this century only by Tolkien's trilogy <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Readers who fall in love with Lewis's fantasy series <i>The Chronicles of Namia</i> as children unfailingly cherish his <i>Space Trilogy</i> as adults; it, too, brings to life strange and magical realms in which epic battles are fought between the forces of light and those of darkness. But in the many layers of its allegory, and the sophistication and piercing brilliance of its insights into the human condition, it occupies a place among the English language's most extraordinary works for any age, and for all time.",

    "description": "A heartstrong story of family and romance, tribulation and tenacity, set on the High Plains east of Denver.<br /><br />In the small town of Holt, Colorado, a high school teacher is confronted with raising his two boys alone after their mother retreats first to the bedroom, then altogether. A teenage girl\u2014her father long since disappeared, her mother unwilling to have her in the house\u2014is pregnant, alone herself, with nowhere to go. And out in the country, two brothers, elderly bachelors, work the family homestead, the only world they've ever known.<br /><br />From these unsettled lives emerges a vision of life, and of the town and landscape that bind them together\u2014their fates somehow overcoming the powerful circumstances of place and station, their confusion, curiosity, dignity and humor intact and resonant. As the milieu widens to embrace fully four generations, Kent Haruf displays an emotional and aesthetic authority to rival the past masters of a classic American tradition.<br /><br />Utterly true to the rhythms and patterns of life, <i>Plainsong</i> is a novel to care about, believe in, and learn from.",

    "description": "Aboard a vast seafaring vessel, a band of prisoners and slaves, their bodies remade into grotesque biological oddities, is being transported to the fledgling colony of New Crobuzon. But the journey is not theirs alone. They are joined by a handful of travelers, each with a reason for fleeing the city. Among them is Bellis Coldwine, a renowned linguist whose services as an interpreter grant her passage\u2014and escape from horrific punishment. For she is linked to Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin, the brilliant renegade scientist who has unwittingly unleashed a nightmare upon New Crobuzon.<br /><br />For Bellis, the plan is clear: live among the new frontiersmen of the colony until it is safe to return home. But when the ship is besieged by pirates on the Swollen Ocean, the senior officers are summarily executed. The surviving passengers are brought to Armada, a city constructed from the hulls of pirated ships, a floating, landless mass ruled by the bizarre duality called the Lovers. On Armada, everyone is given work, and even Remades live as equals to humans, Cactae, and Cray. Yet no one may ever leave.<br /><br />Lonely and embittered in her captivity, Bellis knows that to show dissent is a death sentence. Instead, she must furtively seek information about Armada\u2019s agenda. The answer lies in the dark, amorphous shapes that float undetected miles below the waters\u2014terrifying entities with a singular, chilling mission. . . .",

    "description": "The highly anticipated follow-up to the 2,000,000 copy bestselling inspirational book, \"The Power of Now\" <br /> With his bestselling spiritual guide \"The Power of Now,\" Eckhart Tolle inspired millions of readers to discover the freedom and joy of a life lived ?in the now.? In \"A New Earth,\" Tolle expands on these powerful ideas to show how transcending our ego-based state of consciousness is not only essential to personal happiness, but also the key to ending conflict and suffering throughout the world. Tolle describes how our attachment to the ego creates the dysfunction that leads to anger, jealousy, and unhappiness, and shows readers how to awaken to a new state of consciousness and follow the path to a truly fulfilling existence. \"The Power of Now\" was a question-and-answer handbook. \"A New Earth\" has been written as a traditional narrative, offering anecdotes and philosophies in a way that is accessible to all. Illuminating, enlightening, and uplifting, \"A New Earth\" is a profoundly spiritual manifesto for a better way of life?and for building a better world.",

Now comes a reissue of the best-selling debut novel that launched her remarkable career. St. Elizabeth's, a home for unwed mothers in Habit, Kentucky, usually harbors its residents for only a little while. Not so Rose Clinton, a beautiful, mysterious woman who comes to the home pregnant but not unwed, and stays. She plans to give up her child, thinking she cannot be the mother it needs. But when Cecilia is born, Rose makes a place for herself and her daughter amid St. Elizabeth's extended family of nuns and an ever-changing collection of pregnant teenage girls. Rose's past won't be kept away, though, even by St. Elizabeth's; she cannot remain untouched by what she has left behind, even as she cannot change who she has become in the leaving.",

    "description": "The beautiful young widow of the President of the United States thought she was free of the White House, but circumstances have forced her back into the role of the First Lady. Not for long, however, because she's made up her mind to escape -- if only for a few days -- so she can live the life of an ordinary person. All she needs is the perfect disguise...and she's just found it. As an entire nation searches for her, the First Lady teams up with an infuriatingly secretive, quietly seductive stranger and two adorable little orphaned girls in need of a family. And all together they head out across the heartland chasing their own American Dream -- on a wild journey, adventure, and glorious rebirth.<p>Author Biography: </p><p>Susan Elizabeth Phillips, soared into the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list with her 1998 smash <i>Dream A Little Dream,</i> and remained there through two subsequent novels, <i>Lady Be Good</i> and <i>First Lady.</i> In addition to being the only two-time recipient of the Romance Writers of America's prestigious Favorite Book of the Year award, she also holds <i>Romantic Times</i> Career Achievement Award. Susan delights fans by touching hearts as well as funny bones with her wonderfully whimsical and modern fairy tales. A resident of the Chicago suburbs, she is a wife and the mother of two grown sons.</p>",

    "description": "Lost in an art\u2014the art of translation. Thus, in an elegant anagram (translation = lost in an art), Pulitzer Prize-winning author and pioneering cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter hints at what led him to pen a deep personal homage to the witty sixteenth-century French poet Cl\u00e9ment Marot.\u201d<br /><br /><i>Le ton beau de Marot</i>\u201d literally means \u201dThe sweet tone of Marot\u201d, but to a French ear it suggests \u201dLe tombeau de Marot\u201d\u2014that is, \u201dThe tomb of Marot\u201d. That double entendre foreshadows the linguistic exuberance of this book, which was sparked a decade ago when Hofstadter, under the spell of an exquisite French miniature by Marot, got hooked on the challenge of recreating both its sweet message and its tight rhymes in English\u2014jumping through two tough hoops at once. In the next few years, he not only did many of his own translations of Marot's poem, but also enlisted friends, students, colleagues, family, noted poets, and translators\u2014even three state-of-the-art translation programs!\u2014to try their hand at this subtle challenge.<br /><br />The rich harvest is represented here by 88 wildly diverse variations on Marot's little theme. Yet this barely scratches the surface of <i>Le Ton beau de Marot</i>, for small groups of these poems alternate with chapters that run all over the map of language and thought.<br /><br />Not merely a set of translations of one poem, <i>Le Ton beau de Marot</i> is an autobiographical essay, a love letter to the French language, a series of musings on life, loss, and death, a sweet bouquet of stirring poetry\u2014but most of all, it celebrates the limitless creativity fired by a passion for the music of words.<br /><br />Dozens of literary themes and creations are woven into the picture, including Pushkin's <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27829.Eugene_Onegin\" title=\"Eugene Onegin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eugene Onegin</a>\n</i>, Dante's <i><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15645.Inferno\" title=\"Inferno\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inferno</a>,</i> Salinger's <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5107.Catcher_in_the_Rye\" title=\"Catcher in the Rye\" rel=\"nofollow\">Catcher in the Rye</a>\n</i>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/55934.Villon_s\" title=\"Villon's\" rel=\"nofollow\">Villon's</a> <i>Ballades,</i> <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5152.Nabokov_s\" title=\"Nabokov\u2019s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nabokov\u2019s</a> essays, Georges Perec's <i><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3677938.La_Disparition\" title=\"La Disparition\" rel=\"nofollow\">La Disparition</a>,</i> Vikram Seth's <i><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3073568.The_Golden_Gate\" title=\"The Golden Gate\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Golden Gate</a>,</i> <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3341504.Horace_s\" title=\"Horace's\" rel=\"nofollow\">Horace's</a> odes, and more.<br /><br />Rife with stunning form-content interplay, crammed with creative linguistic experiments yet always crystal-clear, this book is meant not only for lovers of literature, but also for people who wish to be brought into contact with current ideas about how creativity works, and who wish to see how today\u2019s computational models of language and thought stack up next to the human mind.<br /><br /><i>Le Ton beau de Marot</i> is a sparkling, personal, and poetic exploration aimed at both the literary and the scientific world, and is sure to provoke great excitement and heated controversy among poets and translators, critics and writers, and those involved in the study of creativity and its elusive wellsprings.",

And the City is where the life of Gavin Blake, who sells sex to high flyers, is finally about to unravel.<br />In the center of the City is St. Benet's, a church that ministers to the casualties of this affluent but amoral society. Carta Graham, the St. Benet's fundraiser, is at once attracted to Gavin when they meet through a mutual friend, but slowly she realizes that she has entered a relationship far more complex than she could ever have imagined. <br />Gavin is desperate to escape from his world of prostitution, pornography and violence, but as his involvement with Carta and St. Benet's deepens, the dangers that encircle him escalate until his life itself is on the line. Carta is determined to help him--but will their mysterious journey together be lifesaving or soul-destroying? All she can do is fight her hardest to help Gavin survive. <br />Consistently surprising and powerfully moving, \"The Heartbreaker\" is Susan Howatch's most gripping novel yet.",

    "description": "Writing with all the passion of \"Love Story\" and power of \"The Class,\" Erich Segal sweeps us into the lives of the Harvard Medical School's class of 1962. His stunning novel reveals the making of doctors--what makes them tick, scheme, hurt . . . and love. From the crucible of med school's merciless training through the demanding hours of internship and residency to the triumphs--and sometimes tragedies--beyond, \"Doctors\" brings to vivid life the men and women who seek to heal but who must first walk through fire. At the novel's heart is the unforgettable relationship of Barney Livingston and Laura Castellano, childhood friends who separately find unsettling celebrity and unsatisfying love--until their friendship ripens into passion. Yet even their devotion to each other, even their medical gifts may not be enough to save the one life they treasure above all others. \"Doctors\" --heartbreaking, witty, inspiring, and utterly, grippingly real--is a vibrant portrait that culminates in a murder, a trial . . . and a miracle.\"A superior story . . . A moving and compelling novel of doctors and their fears--how they confront them or are confounded by them.\"-- \"UPI.\"<br /><br />\"Segal's best work to date.\"-- \"New York Post\"",

    "description": "<b>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER</b><br /><br />Throughout the years that she has lived and worked in East Hampton, Ina Garten has catered and attended countless parties and dinners. She will be the first to tell you, though, that nothing beats a cozy dinner, surrounded by the people you love most, in the comfort that only your own home can provide. In <i>Barefoot Contessa at Home</i>, Ina shares her life in East Hampton, the recipes she loves, and her secrets to making guests feel welcome and comfortable.<br /><br />For Ina, it's friends and family-gathered around the dinner table or cooking with her in the kitchen-that really make her house feel like home. Here Ina offers the tried-and-true recipes that she makes over and over again because they're easy, they work, and they're universally loved. For a leisurely Sunday breakfast, she has <b>Easy Cheese Danishes</b> or <b>Breakfast Fruit Crunch</b> to serve with the perfect <b>Spicy Bloody Mary</b>. For lunch, she has classics with a twist, such as <b>Tomato, Mozzarella, and Pesto Paninis</b> and <b>Old-Fashioned Potato Salad</b>, which are simply delicious. Then there are Ina's homey dinners-from her own version of loin of pork stuffed with sauteed fennel to the exotic flavors of <b>Eli's Asian Salmon</b>. And since Ina knows no one ever forgets what you serve for dessert, she includes recipes for outrageously luscious sweets like <b>Peach and Blueberry Crumble</b>, <b>Pumpkin Mousse Parfait</b>, and <b>Chocolate Cupcakes with Peanut Butter Icing</b>.<br /><br />Ina also lets readers in on her time-tested secrets for cooking and entertaining. Get the inside scoop on everything from what Ina considers when she's designing a kitchen to menu-planning basics and how to make a dinner party fun (here's a hint: it doesn't involve making complicated food!).<br /><br />Along with beautiful photographs of Ina's dishes, her home, and the East Hampton she loves, this book is filled with signature recipes that strike the perfect balance between elegance and casual comfort. With her most indispensable collection yet, Ina Garten proves beyond a shadow of doubt that there truly is no place like home.",

Mo never reads stories aloud to Meggie because he has a special gift: when he reads a book aloud, the characters come out of the book and into the real world. <br /><br />One night, when Meggie was a small child, Mortimer was reading aloud from a book named Inkheart when an evil villain named Capricorn, his aide Basta, and a fire-eater named Dustfinger escape from the book and into their living room. At the same time, Mo's wife Resa gets trapped within the book .<br /><br />Twelve years later, Capricorn is on a hunt to find and destroy all copies of Inkheart and use Mo's abilities to gain more power for himself in the real world. Meggie discovers her father's secret and, along with the help of Dustfinger and Meggie's eccentric aunt Elinor, fights to free her father and destroy Capricorn.",

    "description": "\"I crush up my pills and snort them like dust. They are my sugar. They are the sweetness in the days that have none. They drip through me like tupelo honey. Then they are gone. Then I need more. I always need more. For all of my life I have needed more.\"<br /><br /><br /> A precocious literary light, Elizabeth Wurtzel published her groundbreaking memoir of depression, \"Prozac Nation,\" at the tender age of twenty-six. A worldwide success, a cultural phenomenon, the book opened doors to a rarefied world about which Elizabeth had only dared to dream during her middle-class upbringing in New York City. But no success could staunch her continuous battle with depression. The terrible truth was that nothing had changed the emptiness inside Elizabeth. Her relationships universally failed; she was fired from every magazine job she held. Indeed, the absence of fulfillment in the wake of success became yet another seemingly insurmountable hurdle.<br /><br />When her doctor prescribed Ritalin to boost the effects of her antidepression medication, Elizabeth jumped. And the Ritalin worked. And worked. And worked. Within weeks, she was grinding up the pills and snorting them for a greater effect. It reached the point where she couldn't go more than five minutes without a fix. It was Ritalin, and then cocaine, and then more Ritalin. In a harrowing account, Elizabeth Wurtzel contemplates what it means to be in love with something in your blood that takes over your body, becomes the life force within you -- and could ultimately kill you.<br /><br />\"More, Now, Again\" is an astonishing and timely story of a new kind of addiction. But it is also a story of survival. Elizabeth Wurtzel hits rock bottom, gets clean, usesagain, and finally gains control over her drug and her life. As honest as a confession and as heartfelt as a prayer, \"More, Now, Again\" recounts a courageous fight back to a life worth living.",

Cyril has never been jealous of Nick, though. . .until the day that Nick decides he is interested in Rose Mulligan, Cyril's long-time secret crush.

Disgusted by the treatment of the slaves and her brother's willingness to marry her off, she and one of the slaves, Minerva, run away and join a band of pirates. <br /><br />For both girls the pirate life is their only chance for freedom in a society where both are treated like property, rather than individuals. Together they go in search of adventure, love, and a new life that breaks all restrictions of gender, race, and position. Told through Nancy's writings, their adventures will appeal to readers across the spectrum and around the world.</div>",

In <i>Passing for Thin</i>, Frances describes with unflinching honesty and a wickedly dark sense of humor her first fumbling introductions to her newly slender body, shining a light on the shared human experience of feeling uncomfortable in one\u2019s own skin. She gradually moves from observer to player\u2014enjoying for the first time flirting, exercising, and shopping\u2013as she explores the terrain on the \u201cPlanet of Thin.\u201d As Frances gradually comes to know\u2014and love\u2014the stranger in the mirror, she learns that her body does not define her, but enables her to become the woman she\u2019s always wanted to be.",

    "description": "\"Martin Amis is a stone-solid genius...a dazzling star of wit and insight.\" --<i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br /><br />In this wickedly delightful collection of stories, Martin Amis once again demonstrates why he is a modern master of the form. In \"Career Move,\" screenwriters struggle for their art, while poets are the darlings of Hollywood. In \"Straight Fiction,\" the love that dare not speak its name calls out to the hero when he encounters a forbidden object of desire--the opposite sex. And in \"State of England,\" Mal, a former \"minder to the superstars,\" discovers how to live in a country where \"class and race and gender were supposedly gone.\"<br /><br />In <b>Heavy Water and Other Stories</b>, Amis astonishes us with the vast range of his talent, establishing that he is one of the most versatile and gifted writers of his generation.",

    "description": "From the best-selling author of <i>Black Hawk Down</i> comes a riveting, definitive chronicle of the Iran hostage crisis, America's first battle with militant Islam. On November 4, 1979, a group of radical Islamist students, inspired by the revolutionary Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini, stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran. They took fifty-two Americans hostage, and kept nearly all of them hostage for 444 days.<br /><br />In <i>Guests of the Ayatollah</i>, Mark Bowden tells this sweeping story through the eyes of the hostages, the soldiers in a new special forces unit sent to free them, their radical, na\u00efve captors, and the diplomats working to end the crisis. Bowden takes us inside the hostages' cells and inside the Oval Office for meetings with President Carter and his exhausted team. We travel to international capitals where shadowy figures held clandestine negotiations, and to the deserts of Iran, where a courageous, desperate attempt to rescue the hostages exploded into tragic failure. Bowden dedicated five years to this research, including numerous trips to Iran and countless interviews with those involved on both sides.<br /><br /><i>Guests of the Ayatollah</i> is a detailed, brilliantly re-created, and suspenseful account of a crisis that gripped and ultimately changed the world.",

    "description": "Written more than two thousand years ago, the <i>Tao Teh Ching, </i> or \"The Classic of the Way and Its Virtue,\" has probably had a greater influence on Asian thought than any other single book. It is also one of the true classics of world literature.<br /><br />Traditionally attributed to the near-legendary \"Old Master,\" Lao Tzu, the <i>Tao Teh Ching </i> teaches that the qualities of the enlightened sage or ideal ruler are identical with those of the perfected individual. Today, Lao Tzu's words are as useful in mastering the arts of leadership in business and politics as they are in developing a sense of balance and harmony in everyday life. To follow the Tao or Way of all things and realize their true nature is to embody humility, spontaneity, and generosity.",

    "description": "In the 1880s, as the European powers were carving up Africa, King Leopold II of Belgium seized for himself the vast and mostly unexplored territory surrounding the Congo River. Carrying out a genocidal plundering of the Congo, he looted its rubber, brutalized its people, and ultimately slashed its population by ten million\u2014all the while shrewdly cultivating his reputation as a great humanitarian. Heroic efforts to expose these crimes eventually led to the first great human rights movement of the twentieth century, in which everyone from Mark Twain to the Archbishop of Canterbury participated. King Leopold's Ghost is the haunting account of a megalomaniac of monstrous proportions, a man as cunning, charming, and cruel as any of the great Shakespearean villains. It is also the deeply moving portrait of those who fought Leopold: a brave handful of missionaries, travelers, and young idealists who went to Africa for work or adventure and unexpectedly found themselves witnesses to a holocaust. Adam Hochschild brings this largely untold story alive with the wit and skill of a Barbara Tuchman. Like her, he knows that history often provides a far richer cast of characters than any novelist could invent. Chief among them is Edmund Morel, a young British shipping agent who went on to lead the international crusade against Leopold. Another hero of this tale, the Irish patriot Roger Casement, ended his life on a London gallows. Two courageous black Americans, George Washington Williams and William Sheppard, risked much to bring evidence of the Congo atrocities to the outside world. Sailing into the middle of the story was a young Congo River steamboat officer named Joseph Conrad. And looming above them all, the duplicitous billionaire King Leopold II. With great power and compassion, King Leopold's Ghost will brand the tragedy of the Congo\u2014too long forgotten\u2014onto the conscience of the West.",

    "description": "Written by the chief military correspondent of the <i>New York Times </i>and a prominent retired Marine general, this is the definitive account of the invasion of Iraq.A stunning work of investigative journalism, <i>Cobra II </i>describes in riveting detail how the American rush to Baghdad provided the opportunity for the virulent insurgency that followed. As Gordon and Trainor show, the brutal aftermath was not inevitable and was a surprise to the generals on both sides. Based on access to unseen documents and exclusive interviews with the men and women at the heart of the war, <i>Cobra II</i> provides firsthand accounts of the fighting on the ground and the high-level planning behind the scenes. Now with a new afterword that addresses what transpired after the fateful events of the summer of 2003, this is a peerless re-creation and analysis of the central event of our times.",

    "description": "John Piper writes, \"I will tell you what a tragedy is. I will show you how to waste your life. Consider this story from the February 1998 Reader's Digest: A couple 'took early retirement from their jobs in the Northeast five years ago when he was 59 and she was 51. Now they live in Punta Gorda, Florida, where they cruise on their 30-foot trawler, play softball and collect shells. . . .' Picture them before Christ at the great day of judgment: 'Look, Lord. See my shells.' That is a tragedy.<br /><br />\"God created us to live with a single passion to joyfully display his supreme excellence in all the spheres of life. The wasted life is the life without this passion. God calls us to pray and think and dream and plan and work not to be made much of, but to make much of him in every part of our lives.\"<br /><br />Most people slip by in life without a passion for God, spending their lives on trivial diversions, living for comfort and pleasure, and perhaps trying to avoid sin. This book will warn you not to get caught up in a life that counts for nothing. It will challenge you to live and die boasting in the cross of Christ and making the glory of God your singular passion. If you believe that to live is Christ and to die is gain, read this book, learn to live for Christ, and don't waste your life!",

    "description": "\"Instead of God I believe in ghosts,\" writes the literary scholar Ruth Kluger in this harrowing memoir of life under the yellow star, a controversial bestseller in Germany.<br />Born in Vienna, Kluger somehow survived a girlhood spent in Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and Gross-Rosen. Some of the lessons she imparts are surprising, as when she argues, against other historians, that the female camp guards were far more humane than their male counterparts, and when she admits that she has difficulty today queuing in line, a constant of camp life, \"out of revulsion for the bovine activity of simply standing.\" Her memories of her youth are punctuated by sharp reflections on the meaning of the Shoah, and how it should best be memorialized in a time when ever fewer survivors are left to act as witnesses. Those reflections are often angry -- \"Absolutely nothing good came out of the concentration camps,\" she writes, recalling an argument with a naive German graduate student, \"and he expects catharsis, purgation, the sort of thing you go to the theatre for?\"<br />But they are constantly provocative, too. Though readers will doubtless take issue with some of her conclusions, Kluger's insistent memoir merits a wide audience. <br /><br /><br /><i>--Gregory McNamee</i>",

    "description": "Sometime this century the day will arrive when the human influence on the climate will overwhelm all other natural factors. Over the past decade, the world has seen the most powerful El Niqo ever recorded, the most devastating hurricane in two hundred years, the hottest European summer on record, and one of the worst storm seasons ever experienced in Florida. With one out of every five living things on this planet committed to extinction by the levels of greenhouse gases that will accumulate in the next few decades, we are reaching a global climatic tipping point. \"The Weather Makers\" is both an urgent warning and a call to arms, outlining the history of climate change, how it will unfold over the next century, and what we can do to prevent a cataclysmic future. Along with a riveting history of climate change, Tim Flannery offers specific suggestions for action for both lawmakers and individuals, from investing in renewable power sources like wind, solar, and geothermal energy, to offering an action plan with steps each and every one of us can take right now to reduce deadly CO2 emissions by as much as 70 percent.",

This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.<br /><br />\"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\" <br /><br />So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy-- exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling-- does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. <br /><br />Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors--yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness. <br /><br />Angela's Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.",

From the emergence of mind, he traces the evolution of human consciousness through its major stages of growth and development. He particularly focuses on modernity and postmodernity: what they mean; how they impact gender issues, psychotherapy, ecological concerns, and various liberation movements; and how the modern and postmodern world conceive of Spirit. This second edition features forty pages of new material, new diagrams, and extensively revised notes.",

    "description": "A gripping memoir that reads like a political thriller--the story of Malika Oufkir's turbulent and remarkable life. Born in 1953, Malika Oufkir was the eldest daughter of General Oufkir, the King of Morocco's closest aide. Adopted by the king at the age of five, Malika spent most of her childhood and adolescence in the seclusion of the court harem, one of the most eligible heiresses in the kingdom, surrounded by luxury and extraordinary privilege. <p>Then, on August 16, 1972, her father was arrested and executed after an attempt to assassinate the king. Malika, her five younger brothers and sisters. and her mother were immediately imprisoned in a desert penal colony. After fifteen years, the last ten of which they spent locked up in solitary cells, the Oufkir children managed to dig a tunnel with their bare hands and make an audacious escape. Recaptured after five days, Malika was finally able to leave Morocco and begin a new life in exile in 1996. </p><p>A heartrending account in the face of extreme deprivation and the courage with which one family faced its fate, Stolen Lives is an unforgettable story of one woman's journey to freedom.</p>",

    "description": "\u201cExcuse me, are you Jewish?\u201d With these words, the relentlessly cheerful, ideologically driven emissaries of Chabad-Lubavitch approach perfect strangers on street corners throughout the world in their ongoing efforts to persuade their fellow Jews to live religiously observant lives. In The Rebbe\u2019s Army, award-winning journalist Sue Fishkoff gives us the first behind-the-scenes look at this small Brooklyn-based group of Hasidim and the extraordinary lengths to which they take their mission of outreach. <br /><br />They seem to be everywhere\u2014in big cities, small towns, and suburbs throughout the United States, and in sixty-one countries around the world. They light giant Chanukah menorahs in public squares, run \u201cChabad houses\u201d on college campuses from Berkeley to Cambridge, give weekly bible classes in the Capitol basement <br />in Washington, D.C., run a nonsectarian drug treatment center in Los Angeles, sponsor the world\u2019s biggest Passover Seder in Nepal, establish synagogues, Hebrew schools, and day-care centers in places that are often indifferent and occasionally hostile to their outreach efforts. They have built a billion-dollar international empire, with their own news service, publishing house, and hundreds of Websites.<br /><br />Who are these people? How successful are they in making Jews more observant? What influence does their late Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson (who some thought was the Messiah), continue to have on his followers? Fishkoff spent a year interviewing Lubavitch emissaries from Anchorage to Miami and has written an engaging and fair-minded account of a Hasidic group whose motives and methodology continue to be the subject of speculation and controversy.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

Together, they had forged a legendary kingdom, and its fame would live forever. Yet there had been a dark side to the prophecy, and the white shadow of fate ever hung over the Queen.<br /><br />Now Guinevere thought she knew what that shadow was: she was barren. She accepted that -- just as she accepted that Arthur must have an heir And the only true heir of his body was Mordred -- offspring of a cursed encounter with Arthur's own sister, the witch Morgause.<br /><br />Guinevere couldn't give Arthur her own child, so she would give him his own son: Mordred. She would raise the boy, teach him to be a king. He would be like Arthur -- wise, coolheaded. He would honor Camelot and all it stood for. She would love him like a mother.<br /><br />He was to be her greatest joy, and her greatest despair...",

    "description": "This is the life of T.S. Garp, the bastard son of Jenny Fields--a feminist leader ahead of her time. This is the life and death of a famous mother and her almost-famous son; theirs is a world of sexual extremes--even of sexual assassinations. It is a novel rich with \"lunacy and sorrow\"; yet the dark, violent events of the story do not undermine a comedy both ribald and robust. In more than forty countries--with more than ten million copies in print--this novel provides almost cheerful, even hilarious evidence of its famous last line: \"In the world according to Garp, we are all terminal cases.\"",

    "description": "Rumi was one of the great mystical poets of all time, a vibrant figure whose unorthodox views on love still resonate today. Although little is known about his life, we do know that he lived in Anatolia, had an extraordinary spiritual friendship with a man named Shams, and brought an adopted girl, Kimya, into his family. This stirring novel is Kimya\u2019s story\u2014of how she finds herself drawn to the mysterious Shams, and how, by marrying him, her soul begins its true journey into fire. Set against the decline of the Byzantine Empire and the Mongol invasions, this tale of a tempestuous love affair combines all the timeless themes and passions of Rumi\u2019s own verse.",

    "description": "<b>THE NUMBER ONE INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER</b><br /><b>WINNER OF THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S AWARD</b><br /><b></b><br /><b>'Indisputably the best account of the whole terrible Rwandan genocide.' R. W. Johnson, <i>Sunday Times</i></b><br /><br /><b>'Angry, accusatory and extremely moving.' Caroline Moorhead, <i>Spectator</i></b><br /><br /><br />When Lieutenant General Rom\u00e9o Dallaire received the call to serve as force commander of the UN mission to Rwanda, he thought he was heading off to Africa to help two warring parties achieve a peace both sides wanted. Instead, he and members of his small international force were caught up in a vortex of civil war and genocide. Dallaire left Rwanda a broken man; disillusioned, suicidal, and determined to tell his story.<br /><br />An award-winning international sensation, <i>Shake Hands with the Devil</i> is a landmark contribution to the literature of war: a remarkable tale of a soldier's courage and an unforgettable portrait of modern warfare. It is also a stinging indictment of the petty bureaucrats who refused to give Dallaire the men and the operational freedom he needed to stop the killing. 'I know there is a God,' Dallaire writes, 'because in Rwanda I shook hands with the devil. I have seen him, I have smelled him and I have touched him. I know the devil exists and therefore I know there is a God.'<br /><br /><br /><b>'Read Rom\u00e9o Dallaire's profoundly sad and moving book.' Madeleine Albright, <i>Washington Post</i></b>",

The only thing that connects them is Linda\u2019s six-week-old marriage to Robin\u2019s father, who has suddenly died. <br /><br />Widowed at twenty-six, Linda is heading to California to start over, uncertain what the future holds. In the trunk of her car, she carries her husband\u2019s amateur paintings, along with his ashes. Robin, her silent, angry teenage stepdaughter, about to be left with relatives she\u2019s never met, carries a private stash of pot and some closely guarded secrets. But these two women, journeying on a road alongside drifters and dreamers, lovers and liars, will discover something they never expected to find\u2013between them and inside their hearts.",

Ueno is now living with her proteg\u00e9e and a jealous lover, Keiko Sakami, and the unfolding relationships between Oki, Otoko, and Keiko form the plot of the novel. Keiko states several times that she will avenge Otoko for Oki's abandonment, and the story coalesces into a climactic ending.",

    "description": "Ayn Rand here sets for the the moral principles of Objectivism, the philosophy that holds man's life - the life proper to a rational being - as the standard of moral values and regards altruism as imcompatible with man's nature, with the creative requirements of his survival and with a free society.<br /><p>Ayn Rand wrote <i>Atlas Shrugged,</i> philosophically the most challenging bestseller in its time. Her first novel, <i>We the Living,</i> was published in 1936. With the publication of <i>The Fountainhead</i> in 1943, she achieved a spectacular and enduring success. Miss Rand's unique philosophy, Objectivism, has gained a worldwide audience. The fundamentals of her philosophy are set forth in four nonfiction books: <i>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, For the New Intellectual, The Virtue of Selfishness,</i> and <i>Capitalism: the Unknown Ideal.</i> The magnificent statement of her artistic credo, <i>The Romantic Manifesto,</i> is also available in a Signet edition.</p>",

    "description": "Wouldn't you love to abolish the IRS ...<br />Keep all the money in your paycheck ...<br />Pay taxes on what you spend, not what you earn ...<br />And eliminate all the fraud, hassle, and waste of our current system?<br /><br />Then the FairTax is for you. In the face of the outlandish American tax burden, talk-radio firebrand Neal Boortz and Congressman John Linder are leading the charge to phase out our current, unfair system and enact the FairTax Plan, replacing the federal income tax and withholding system with a simple 23 percent retail sales tax on new goods and services. This dramatic revision of the current system, which would eliminate the reviled IRS, has already caught fire in the American heartland, with more than six hundred thousand taxpayers signing on in support of the plan.<br /><br />As Boortz and Linder reveal in this first book on the FairTax, this radical but eminently sensible plan would end the annual national nightmare of filing income tax returns, while at the same time enlarging the federal tax base by collecting sales tax from every retail consumer in the country. The FairTax, they argue, would transform the fearsome bureaucracy of the IRS into a more transparent, accountable, and equitable tax collection system. Among other benefits, it will:<br /><br /><br />Make America's tax code truly voluntary, without reducing revenue<br />Replace today's indecipherable tax code with one simple sales tax<br />Protect lower-income Americans by covering the tax on basic necessities<br />Eliminate billions of dollars in embedded taxes we don't even know we're paying<br />Bring offshore corporate dollars back into the U.S. economy<br />Endorsed by scores of leading economists and supported by a huge and growing grassroots movement, the FairTax Plan could revolutionize the way America pays for itself. In this straight-talking book, Neal Boortz and John Linder show you how it would work\u2014and how you can help make it happen.",

    "description": "\"The day will come when not only my writings, but precisely my life--the intriguing secret of all the machinery--will be studied and studied.\" S\ufffdren Kierkegaard's remarkable combination of genius and peculiarity made this a fair if arrogant prediction. But Kierkegaard's life has been notoriously hard to study, so complex was the web of fact and fiction in his work. Joakim Garff's biography of Kierkegaard is thus a landmark achievement. A seamless blend of history, philosophy, and psychological insight, all conveyed with novelistic verve, this is the most comprehensive and penetrating account yet written of the life and works of the enigmatic Dane who changed the course of intellectual history.<br /><br /><br /> Garff portrays Kierkegaard not as the all-controlling impresario behind some of the most important works of modern philosophy and religious thought--books credited with founding existentialism and prefiguring postmodernism--but rather as a man whose writings came to control him. Kierkegaard saw himself as a vessel for his writings, a tool in the hand of God, and eventually as a martyr singled out to call for the end of \"Christendom.\" Garff explores the events and relationships that formed Kierkegaard, including his guilt-ridden relationship with his father, his rivalry with his brother, and his famously tortured relationship with his fianc\ufffde Regine Olsen. He recreates the squalor and splendor of Golden Age Copenhagen and the intellectual milieu in which Kierkegaard found himself increasingly embattled and mercilessly caricatured.<br /><br /><br /> Acclaimed as a major cultural event on its publication in Denmark in 2000, this book, here presented in an exceptionally crisp and elegant translation, will be the definitive account of Kierkegaard's life for years to come.",

Despite the wishes of her mother, Susan and her best friend, Connie, collect silk dresses from all the ladies of Richmond to make a balloon that will be used to spy on the Yankees.<br /><br />But the issues behind the war aren't as obvious as Susan thinks. When she meets her dashing, scandalous older brother and discovers why he was banished from the family, Susan unlocks a Pandora's box of secrets that forces her to rethink and challenge the very system she was born into. Does she have the courage to do what is right even though it may hurt the ones she loves?",

    "description": "\"The Passion Dream Book\" travels from the Italian Renaissance, when a girl spends her days spying on a young Michelangelo and experiences the divided love of wanting the artist and wanting to be the artist, to the early years of the twentieth century, when the novel follows Romy March, a descendant of the Renaissance girl, and Augustine Marks, who are both artists. The novel is an imaginative mix of fact and fiction, history and story, about the two enduring, occasionally conflicting passions of love and work. As Romy March and Augustine Marks migrate from place to place, separately and together, their love is their home, and their home is each other. The outsider lives they lead take them from one cultural scene to another: silent-era Hollywood, the Harlem Renaissance, Paris in the late 1920s, and back to the United States. The novel touches on the migratory habits of artists' colonies; the search for and creation of identity as an artist and a lover; and how one lives when tradition doesn't hold.",

    "description": "In this bitterly funny novel by the renowned Polish author Witold Gombrowicz. a writer finds himself tossed into a chaotic world of schoolboys by a diabolical professor who wishes to reduce him to childishness. Originally published in Poland in 1937. Ferdydurke became an instant literary sensation and catapulted the young author to fame. Deemed scandalous and subversive by Nazis. Stalinists. and the Polish Communist regime in turn. the novel (as well as all of Gombrowicz's other works) was officially banned in Poland for decades. It has nonetheless remained one of the most influential works of twentieth-century European literature.  <p>Ferdydurke is translated here directly from the Polish for the first time. Danuta Borchardt deftly captures Gombrowicz's playful and idiosyncratic style. and she allows English speakers to experience fully the masterpiece of a writer whom Milan Kundera describes as \"one of the great novelists of our century.\" </p> <p>\"Extravagant. brilliant. disturbing. brave. funny-wonderful. . . . Long live its sublime mockery.\"<br /> ~ Susan Sontag. from the foreword </p> <p>\"[A] masterpiece of European modernism. . . . Susan Sontag ushers this new translation into print with a strong and useful foreword. calling Gombrowicz's tale 'extravagant. brilliant. disturbing. brave. funny... wonderful.' And it is.\"<br /> ~ Publishers Weekly </p> <p>Witold Gombrowicz (1904-1969) wrote three other novels. Trans-Atlantyk. Pornografia. and Cosmos. which together with his plays and his three-volume Diary have been translated into more than thirty languages. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Four thousand years ago, a stranger's death at the Old Temple of Ratharryn-and his ominous \"gift\" of gold-precipitates the building of what for centuries to come will be known as one of mankind's most singular and remarkable achievements. Bernard Cornwell's epic novel <i>Stonehenge</i> catapults us into a powerful and vibrant world of ritual and sacrifice at once timeless and wholly original-a tale of patricide, betrayal, and murder; of bloody brotherly rivalry: and of the never-ending quest for power, wealth, and spiritual fulfillment.<br /></p><p><br />Three brothers-deadly rivals-are uneasily united in their quest to create a temple to their gods. There is Lengar, the eldest, a ruthless warrior intent on replacing his father as chief of the tribe of Ratharryn; Camaban, his bastard brother, a sorcerer whose religious fervor inspires the plan for Stonehenge; and Saban, the youngest, through whose expertise the temple will finally be completed. Divided by blood but united-precariously-by a shared vision, the brothers begin erecting their mighty ring of granite, aligning towering stones to the movement of the heavenly bodies, and raising arches to appease and unite their gods. Caught between the zealousness of his ambitious brothers, Saban becomes the true leader of his people, a peacemaker who will live to see the temple built in the name of salvation and regeneration.<br /></p><p><br />Bernard Cornwell, long admired for his rousing narrative and meticulous historical imaginings, has here delivered his masterpiece, the most compelling and powerful human drama of its kind since Ken Follett's <i>Pillars of the Earth</i> and Edward Rutherford's <i>Sarum</i>. His re-creation of civilization as it might have been in 2000 B.C. at once amplifies the mystery of his subject and makes the world of Stonehenge come alive as never before.<br /></p>",

    "description": "Vikas Swarup's spectacular debut novel opens in a jail cell in Mumbai, India, where Ram Mohammad Thomas is being held after correctly answering all twelve questions on India's biggest quiz show, <i>Who Will Win a Billion?</i> It is hard to believe that a poor orphan who has never read a newspaper or gone to school could win such a contest. But through a series of exhilarating tales Ram explains to his lawyer how episodes in his life gave him the answer to each question. <br /> Ram takes us on an amazing review of his own history -- from the day he was found as a baby in the clothes donation box of a Delhi church to his employment by a faded Bollywood star to his adventure with a security-crazed Australian army colonel to his career as an overly creative tour guide at the Taj Mahal. <br /> Swarup's <i>Q &amp; A</i> is a beguiling blend of high comedy, drama, and romance that reveals how we know what we know -- not just about trivia, but about life itself. Cutting across humanity in all its squalor and glory, Vikas Swarup presents a kaleidoscopic vision of the struggle between good and evil -- and what happens when one boy has no other choice in life but to survive.",

What is going to happen to their blissful existence of eating take-out, drinking too much wine, bringing men home, and never vacuuming?<br /><br />Lucy reassures her friends that she's far too busy arguing with her mother and taking care of her irresponsible father to get married. And then there's the small matter of not even having a boyfriend.<br /><br />But then Lucy meets gorgeous, unreliable Gus. Could he be the future Mr. Lucy Sullivan? Or could it be handsome Chuck? Or Daniel, the world's biggest flirt? Or even cute Jed, the new guy at work?<br /><br />Maybe her friends have something to worry about after all....",

    "description": "<b>Winner of the 1989 National Book Award</b><br /><br />A classic tale of a man, a boat, and a storm, <b>Spartina</b> is the lyrical and compassionate story of Dick Pierce, a commercial fisherman along the shores of Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay. A kind, sensitive, family man, he is also prone to irascible outbursts against the people he must work for, now that he can no longer make his living from the sea.<br /><br />Pierce's one great passion, a fifty-foot fishing boat called <i>Spartina</i>, lies unfinished in his back yard. Determined to get the funds he needs to buy her engine, he finds himself taking a foolish, dangerous risk. But his real test comes when he must weather a storm at sea in order to keep his dream alive. Moving and poetic, <i>Spartina</i> is a masterly story of one man's ongoing struggle to find his place in the world.",

    "description": "A number-one bestseller from coast to coast, <i>Den of Thieves</i> tells, in masterfully reported detail, the full story of the insider-trading scandal that nearly destroyed Wall Street, the men who pulled it off, and the chase that finally brought them to justice. Pulitzer Prize winner James B. Stewart shows for the first time how four of the biggest names on Wall Street -- Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, Martin Siegel, and Dennis Levine -- created the greatest insider-trading ring in financial history and almost walked away with billions, until a team of downtrodden detectives triumphed over some of America's most expensive lawyers to bring this powerful quartet to justice.<br /><br />Based on secret grand jury transcripts, interviews, and actual trading records, and containing explosive new revelations about Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky written especially for this paperback edition, <i>Den of Thieves</i> weaves all the facts into an unforgettable narrative -- a portrait of human nature, big business, and crime of unparalleled proportions.",

They have made their homes beneath the floorboards for generations and no longer remember -- or even believe in -- life beyond the Store walls.<br /><br />Until the day a small band of nomes arrives at the Store from the Outside. Led by a young nome named Masklin, the Outsiders carry a mysterious black box (called the Thing), and they deliver devastating news: In twenty-one days, the Store will be destroyed.<br /><br />Now all the nomes must learn to work together, and they must learn to think -- and to think BIG.<br /><br />Part satire, part parable, and part adventure story par excellence, master storyteller Terry Pratchett\u2019s engaging trilogy traces the nomes\u2019 flight and search for safety, a search that leads them to discover their own astonishing origins and takes them beyond their wildest dreams.",

    "description": "Finally--You \"Can\"Understand Her! <br />Women: Complicated and impossible to understand? Do you love and want to please the woman in your life, but just can't seem to figure her out? That was before \"For Men Only.\" Now at your fingertips is the tool that will unlock the secret to her mysterious ways. Through hundreds of interviews and the results of a scientific national survey of women, this book demonstrates that women are actually not random and that they really can be systematized and \"mapped.\" In fact, much to men's delight, this book shows that women are actually quite easy to understand and please--as long as you know what it is they need. This simple map will guide you to loving your wife or girlfriend in the way she needs to be loved. <br />The bestselling author of \"For Women Only\"teams with her husband to offer men the key to unlocking the mysterious ways of women. Through Shaunti and Jeff Feldhahn 's national scientific survey and hundreds of interviews, \"For Men Only\" reveals what you can do today to improve your relationship. And believe it or not, as Jeff assures men, \"It's not splitting the atom.\" <br />And for every guy who rarely reads a manual: Quick-Start Guide Included! <br />\"When we featured Shaunti's book \"For Women Only\" on \"FamilyLife Today,\" \"\"the phone rang off the hook! When Shaunti and Jeff come back on our broadcast, I'm buying some more phones. This is fresh and relevant--good stuff for every marriage. Read it!\" <br />\"-Dennis Rainey, President, FamilyLife <br />\"<br />Story Behind the Book <br />\"As I was writing \"For Women Only \"to help women understand the inner lives of men, over and over I heard that men wished there was a way to understand their wives, but they felt it was probably impossible. I heard from them, 'You are writing this little slim volume about men, but if it was about understanding women, it would have to be the size of an encyclopedia! Women are random and complicated!' These men were surprised and encouraged when I assured them that women are neither random nor complicated, and we can be understood. Men just want to love their wives well, and \"For Men Only \"will help them do that.\" <br />\"--Shaunti Feldhahn\"",

    "description": "<b>\"A fascinating book. In clear and forceful prose, Becoming Justice Blackmun tells a judicial Horatio Alger story and a tale of a remarkable transformation . . . A page-turner.\"--The New York Times Book Review</b><br /><b></b>In this acclaimed biography, Linda Greenhouse of <i>The New York Times</i> draws back the curtain on America's most private branch of government, the Supreme Court. Greenhouse was the first print reporter to have access to the extensive archives of Justice Harry A. Blackmun (1908-99), the man behind numerous landmark Supreme Court decisions, including Roe v. Wade.<br /><br />Through the lens of Blackmun's private and public papers, Greenhouse crafts a compelling portrait of a man who, from 1970 to 1994, ruled on such controversial issues as abortion, the death penalty, and sex discrimination yet never lost sight of the human beings behind the legal cases. Greenhouse also paints the arc of Blackmun's lifelong friendship with Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, revealing how political differences became personal, even for two of the country's most respected jurists.<br /><br />From America's preeminent Supreme Court reporter, this is a must-read for everyone who cares about the Court and its impact on our lives.",

And if democracy was made safe, then nothing else mattered--not the millions of dead bodies, nor the thousands of ruined lives... This is no ordinary novel. This is a novel that never takes the easy way out: it is shocking, violent, terrifying, horrible, uncompromising, brutal, remorseless and gruesome... but so is war. Winner of the National Book Award<br /><br />\"Mr. Trumbo sets this story down almost without pause or punctuation and with a fury amounting to eloquence.\"-- \"The New York Times\"<br /><br />\"It is hard to imaging a more persuasive argument for staying out of war than this smooth, savage, brilliant tale.\"-- \"Chicago Daily News\"",

    "description": "Quinine: The Jesuits discovered it. The Protestants feared it. The British vied with the Dutch for it, and the Nazis seized it. Because of quinine, medicine, warfare, and exploration were changed forever.<br /><br />For more than one thousand years, there was no cure for malaria. In 1623, after ten cardinals and hundreds of their attendants died in Rome while electing Urban VII the new pope, he announced that a cure must be found. He encouraged Jesuit priests establishing new missions in Asia and in South America to learn everything they could about how the local people treated the disease, and in 1631, an apothecarist in Peru named Agostino Salumbrino dispatched a new miracle to Rome. The cure was quinine, an alkaloid made from the bitter red bark of the cinchona tree.<br /><br />From the quest of the Englishmen who smuggled cinchona seeds out of South America to the way in which quinine opened the door to Western imperial adventure in Asia, Africa, and beyond, and to malaria's effects even today, award-winning author Fiammetta Rocco deftly chronicles the story of this historically ravenous disease.",

Now an orphan, Devon has been sent to live at Ravenscliff Manor with the foreboding Amanda Muir Crandall, her troubled nephew Alexander, and her feisty daughter Cecily. In the dark seaside mansion, plagued by ghosts, Devon learns the answers to at least some of his questions. Namely, his birthright as a sorcerer of the Order of the Nightwing, a three-thousand-year-old tradition of mysticism and magic, with roots that run deep in Ravenscliff. Living in the most mysterious place in a small town filled with colorful characters, Devon will have to quickly decide who he can trust, as Ravenscliff\u2019s worst nightmare is about to return \u2013 and Devon is the last line of defense.",

    "description": "Devon March matches wits and wizardry against a five-hundred-year-old evil in Demon Witch, the spine-tingling sequel to Sorcerers of the Nightwing. Long before the days of Madman Jackson Muir, a witch named Isobel the Apostate waged war upon her fellow sorcerers, the noble order of the Nightwing. Burned at the stake for her crimes, Isobel vowed to return and conquer the world. Now that she is back, the only person who can prevent hell on earth is fourteen-year-old Devon March. In a battle that takes him from modern-day Ravenscliff to Tudor England and back, Devon must unleash the Nightwing power within himself and call upon friendships in the strangest places to stand against an evil that has waited five centuries for revenge. For at Ravenscliff, friends come in all shapes and sizes -- and enemies are everywhere.",

    "description": "A quirky and quick-witted girl moves to Manhattan and holds on for dear life.<br /><br /><br /><br />Emily Hinton needs out. She comes from a small town in California where the church handbell choir concert passes for a decent way to spend a Saturday and she's known all the boys since kindergarten. She dreams of sophisticated people, love, and Louis Vuitton. When she lands a job at the world-famous publishing house Morrow &amp; Sons in New York, she knows that she is finally on her way. She packs her bags, says good-bye, and sets out for Manhattan, where she will fit in, even if it kills her.<br /><br />In spite of her na\ufffdvet\ufffd, she quickly becomes friends with the girls at work and begins to learn a thing or two about how things are done in Manhattan. She soon attracts the attention of the handsome Bennett and is swept into a whirlwind romance, but an overnight visit to his parents' home at Thanksgiving and his seemingly idle flirtations with one of her colleagues give her second thoughts about what Bennett really wants. Her uncertainty about her feelings escalates when one of the hometown boys she left behind reappears in her life. Emily's days at the office are also becoming complicated: an ambitious editor is breaking all the rules to publish a controversial book that demeans everything she believes in. Will she stand up for what she knows is right and risk losing it all?<br /><br />Balancing her passion for the glamour of New York City with her determination to live by her morals turns out to be much more difficult than Emily ever imagined. Her roundabout quest for happiness will endear her to anyone who has ever dreamed of making it big, and faced more than a few pitfalls along the way.",

If I am worthy to hear thy words, tell me if thou comest from Hell, and from what cloister.\" \"Through all the circles of the realm of woe,\" replied he to him, \"am I come hither; Power of Heaven moved me, and with it I come. Not by doing, but by not doing have I lost the sight of the high Sun whom thou desirest, and who by me was known late. A place there is below not sad with torments but with darkness only, where the lamentations sound not as wailings, but are sighs; there stay I with the little innocents bitten by the teeth of death before they were exempt from human sin; there stay I with those who were not vested with the three holy virtues, and without vice knew the others and followed all of them.",

This captivating story from the unique imagination of Moers is astonishingly inventive, amusing, and engrossing.</i><br /><br />Rumo is a little Wolperting - a domesticated creature somewhere between a deer and a dog - who will one day become the greatest hero in the history of Zamonia. Armed with Dandelion, his talking sword, he fights his way across Overworld and Netherworld, two very different realms chock-full of adventures, dangers, and unforgettable characters: Rala, the beautiful girl Wolperting who cultivates a hazardous relationship with death; Urs of the Snows, who thinks more of cooking than of fighting; Gornab the Ninety-Ninth, the demented king of Netherworld; Professor Ostafan Kolibri, who goes in search of the Non-Existent Teenies; General Ticktock, the evil commander of the Copper Killers; Ushan DeLucca, the finest and most weather-sensitive swordsman in Zamonia; Volzotan Smyke, the corpulent Shark Grub; Rolv of the Forest, a Wolperting who can pass through the White Fire; Yggdra Syl, the guardian of the Nurn Forest and its talkative animals; Professor Abdullah Nightingale, inventor of the Chest-of-Drawers Oracle; and, the worst of luck, the deadly Metal Maiden...",

Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, and the first movies of mass appeal to Louis B. Mayer, who understood what movies meant to America\u2013and reaped the profits. From Capra to Kidman and Hitchcock to Nicholson, Thomson examines the passion, vanity, calculation and gossip of Hollywood and the films it has given us.

    "description": "From one of Serbia's greatest contemporary writers, <em>Hidden Camera</em> opens with the narrator finding a mysterious, blank envelope stuck in his apartment door inviting him to a private showing of a movie. Or so he initially thinks. Upon arrival at the theatre, he discovers that there's only one other person in the audience, a very attractive woman whom he's seated next to. Then things get a bit more mysterious. The movie he's been invited to see includes a scene showing him sitting in a park. Believing that he's an unwitting participant in a complicated hidden camera show, he goes along with the variety of setups he's faced with, which continue to get more involved and absurd. As the show develops, he becomes more and more paranoid and distrustful, but he keeps up the ruse to its thrilling conclusion.<br /><br /><br /><em>Hidden Camera</em> was nominated for the 2007 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award.",

But the challenges are many for the world's first family. Among their children are Cain and Abel, and soon they must discover how to be parents to one son who is everything they could hope for, and another who is sullen, difficult, and rife with insecurities and jealousies. In the background, always, is the incomprehensibility of God's motives as He watches over their faltering attempts to build a life. In <i>Fallen,</i> David Maine has drawn a convincing, wryly observant, and enthralling portrait of a family--one driven (and riven) by passions, irrationality, and love. The result is an intimate, in-depth story of brothers, a husband, and a wife--people whose struggles are both completely familiar and yet utterly original.",

    "description": "\"I like to play indoors better 'cause that's where all the electrical outlets are,\" reports a fourth-grader. Never before in history have children been so plugged in\u2014and so out of touch with the natural world. In this groundbreaking new work, child advocacy expert Richard Louv directly links the lack of nature in the lives of today's wired generation\u2014he calls it nature deficit\u2014to some of the most disturbing childhood trends, such as rises in obesity, Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), and depression.<br /><br /> Some startling facts: By the 1990s the radius around the home where children were allowed to roam on their own had shrunk to a ninth of what it had been in 1970. Today, average eight-year-olds are better able to identify cartoon characters than native species, such as beetles and oak trees, in their own community. The rate at which doctors prescribe antidepressants to children has doubled in the last five years, and recent studies show that too much computer use spells trouble for the developing mind.<br /><br /> Nature-deficit disorder is not a medical condition; it is a description of the human costs of alienation from nature. This alienation damages children and shapes adults, families, and communities. There are solutions, though, and they're right in our own backyards. <i>Last child in the Woods</i> is the first book to bring together cutting-edge research showing that direct exposure to nature is essential for healthy childhood development\u2014physical, emotional, and spiritual. What's more, nature is a potent therapy for depression, obesity, and ADD. Environment-based education dramatically improves standardized test scores and grade point averages and develops skills in problem solving, critical thinking, and decision making. Even creativity is stimulated by childhood experiences in nature. <br /><br /> Yet sending kids outside to play is increasingly difficult. Computers, television, and video games compete for their time, of course, but it's also our fears of traffic, strangers, even virus-carrying mosquitoes\u2014fears the media exploit\u2014that keep children indoors. Meanwhile, schools assign more and more homework, and there is less and less access to natural areas.<br /><br /> Parents have the power to ensure that their daughter or son will not be the \"last child in the woods,\" and this book is the first step toward that nature-child reunion.",

    "description": "Temperamentally and intellectually, Natan Sharansky is a man very much like many of us\u2014which makes this account of his arrest on political grounds, his trial, and ten years' imprisonment in the Orwellian universe of the Soviet gulag particularly vivid and resonant. <br /><br /> Since Fear No Evil was originally published in 1988, the Soviet government that imprisoned Sharansky has collapsed. Sharansky has become an important national leader in Israel\u2014and serves as Israel's diplomatic liaison to the former Soviet Union! New York Times Jerusalem Bureau Chief Serge Schmemann reflects on those monumental events, and on Sharansky's extraordinary life in the decades since his arrest, in a new introduction to this edition. But the truths Sharansky learned in his jail cell and sets forth in this book have timeless importance so long as rulers anywhere on earth still supress their own peoples. For anyone with an interest in human rights\u2014and anyone with an appreciation for the resilience of the human spirit\u2014he illuminates the weapons with which the powerless can humble the powerful: physical courage, an untiring sense of humor, a bountiful imagination, and the conviction that \"Nothing they do can humiliate me. I alone can humiliate myself.\" <br />",

    "description": "A powerfully redemptive story of escape from the Irish American ghetto.<br /><br />Michael Patrick MacDonald's All Souls: A Family Story from Southie told the story of the loss of four of his siblings to the violence, poverty, and gangsterism of Boston's Irish American ghetto. The question \"How did you get out?\" has haunted MacDonald ever since. In response he has written this new book, a searingly honest story of reinvention that begins with young MacDonald's breakaway from the soul-crushing walls of Southie's Old Colony housing project and ends with two healing journeys to Ireland that are unlike anything in Irish American literature.<br /><br />The story begins with MacDonald's first urgent forays outside Southie, into Boston and eventually to New York's East Village, where he becomes part of the club scene swirling around Johnny Rotten, Mission of Burma, the Clash, and other groups. MacDonald's one-of-a-kind 1980s social history gives us a powerful glimpse of what punk music is for him: a lifesaving form of subversion and self-education. But family tragedies draw him home again, where trauma and guilt lead to an emotional collapse. In a harrowing yet hilarious scene of self-discovery, MacDonald meets his father for the first time -- much too late. After this spectacularly failed attempt to connect, MacDonald travels to Ireland, first as an alienated young man who has learned to hate shamrocks with a passion, and then on a second trip with his extraordinary \"Ma,\" a roots journey laced with both rebellion and profound redemption.",

The Cheese Monkeys is a college novel that takes place over a tightly written two semesters. The book is set in the late 1950s at State U, where the young narrator, has decided to major in art, much to his parents\u2019 dismay. It is an autobiographical, coming-of-age novel which tells universally appealing stories of maturity, finding a calling in life, and being inspired by a loving, demanding, and highly eccentric teacher.",

    "description": "An instant blockbuster in Italy where it has sold over 700,000 copies, and now an international literary phenomenon, 100 Strokes of the Brush Before Bed is the fictionalized memoir of Melissa P., a Sicilian teenager whose quest for love rapidly devolves into a shocking journey of sexual discovery.<br /><br />Melissa begins her diary a virgin, but a stormy affair at the age of fourteen leads her to regard sex as a means of self-discovery, and for the next two years she plunges into a succession of encounters with various partners, male and female, her age and much older, some met through schoolmates, others through newspaper ads and Internet chat rooms. In graphic detail she describes her entry into a Dante-esque underworld of eroticism, where she willingly participates in group sex and sadomasochism, as well as casual pickups. Melissa's secret life is concealed from family and friends, revealed only in her diary entries.<br /><br />Told with disarming candor, Melissa P.'s bittersweet tour of extreme desires is as poignant as it is titillating. One Hundred Strokes of the Brush Before Bed is a stunning erotic debut, a Story of O for our times.",

For she is now Arha, the Eaten One, guardian of the ominous Tombs of Atuan. <br /><br />While she is learning her way through the dark labyrinth, a young wizard, Ged, comes to steal the Tombs' greatest hidden treasure, the Ring of Erreth-Akbe. But Ged also brings with him the light of magic, and together, he and Tenar escape from the darkness that has become her domain.",

    "description": "The midnight sun illumines more than fishing and fjords in this remote northern Norwegian village. In fact, half-baked schemes and hilarity abound. Big Ove Rolandsen, telegraph operator, mad scientist, and local Casanova, trades wits, fists, and kisses with a host of quirky neighbors. He serenades the curate's wife and fights a drunken giant, but taking on Trader Mack, the town's fish-glue magnate, is a more difficult matter. Knut Hamsun, author of the acclaimed Hunger and winner of the 1920 Nobel Prize for Literature, renders the dreams and dramas of these townsfolk with a delightfully light touch. Robert Bly has written that Hamsun \"has a magnifying glass on his eye, like a jeweler's,\" and Dreamers gleams like a perfect, semi-precious stone.",

    "description": "<i>The Dead Father </i>is a gargantuan half-dead, half-alive, part mechanical, wise, vain, powerful being who still has hopes for himself--even while he is being dragged by means of a cable toward a mysterious goal. In this extraordinary novel, marked by the imaginative use of language that influenced a generation of fiction writers, Donald Barthelme offered a glimpse into his fictional universe. As Donald Antrim writes in his introduction, \"Reading <i>The Dead Father</i>, one has the sense that its author enjoys an almost complete artistic freedom . . . a permission to reshape, misrepresent, or even ignore the world as we find it . . . Laughing along with its author, we escape anxiety and feel alive.\"",

    "description": "<b>From Mark Kurlansky, the bestselling author of Cod, Salt, and Birdseye\u2014the illuminating story of an ancient and enigmatic people.</b><br /><br />Straddling a small corner of Spain and France in a land that is marked on no maps except their own, the Basques are a puzzling contradiction\u2014they are Europe's oldest nation without ever having been a country. No one has ever been able to determine their origins, and even the Basques' language, Euskera\u2014the most ancient in Europe\u2014is related to none other on earth. For centuries, their influence has been felt in nearly every realm, from religion to sports to commerce. Even today, the Basques are enjoying what may be the most important cultural renaissance in their long existence.<br /><br />Mark Kurlansky's passion for the Basque people and his exuberant eye for detail shine throughout this fascinating book. Like <i>Cod</i>, <i>The Basque History of the World</i>,blends human stories with economic, political, literary, and culinary history into a rich and heroic tale.<br /><br />Among the Basques' greatest accomplishments:<br /><br /><br />Exploration\u2014the first man to circumnavigate the globe, Juan Sebastian de Elcano, was a Basque and the Basques were the second Europeans, after the Vikings, in North America Gastronomy and agriculture\u2014they were the first Europeans to eat corn and chili peppers and cultivate tobacco, and were among the first to use chocolate Religion\u2014Ignatius Loyola, a Basque, founded the Jesuit religious order Business and politics\u2014they introduced capitalism and modern commercial banking to southern Europe Recreation\u2014they invented beach resorts, jai alai, and racing regattas, and were the first Europeans to play sports with balls<br />\u201cA delectable portrait of an uncanny, indomitable nation.\u201d \u2013Newsday<br /><br />\u201cExciting, Illuminating, and thought provoking.\u201d \u2013The Boston Globe<br /><br />\"Entertaining and instructive\u2026 [Kurlansky\u2019s] approach is unorthodox, mixing history with anecdotes, poems with recipes.\u201d \u2013The New York Times Book Review",

It proposes enlightening similarities between, for instance, maneuvering in limited war and in a traffic jam; deterring the Russians and one's own children; the modern strategy of terror and the ancient institution of hostages.",

    "description": "\"Schelling here offers an early analysis of 'tipping' in social situations involving a large number of individuals.\" \u2014official citation for the 2005 Nobel Prize<br /><br /><br /><em>Micromotives and Macrobehavior</em> was originally published over twenty-five years ago, yet the stories it tells feel just as fresh today. And the subject of these stories\u2014how small and seemingly meaningless decisions and actions by individuals often lead to significant unintended consequences for a large group\u2014is more important than ever. In one famous example, Thomas C. Schelling shows that a slight-but-not-malicious preference to have neighbors of the same race eventually leads to completely segregated populations.<br /><br /><br />The updated edition of this landmark book contains a new preface and the author's Nobel Prize acceptance speech.",

    "description": "In 1855, Walt Whitman published \u2014 at his own expense \u2014 the first edition of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, a visionary volume of twelve poems. Showing the influence of a uniquely American form of mysticism known as Transcendentalism, which eschewed the general society and culture of the time, the writing is distinguished by an explosively innovative free verse style and previously unmentionable subject matter. Exalting nature, celebrating the human body, and praising the senses and sexual love, the monumental work was condemned as \"immoral.\" Whitman continued evolving <i>Leaves of Grass</i> despite the controversy, growing his influential work decades after its first appearance by adding new poems with each new printing.<br />This edition presents the original twelve poems from Whitman's premier 1855 publication of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. Included are some of the greatest poems of modern times: \"Song of Myself,\" \"I Sing the Body Electric,\" and \"There Was a Child Went Forth,\" works that continue to upset conventional notions of beauty and originality even today.",

    "description": "Jim, a young British seaman, becomes first mate on the Patna, a ship full of pilgrims travelling to Mecca for the hajj. When the ship starts rapidly taking on water and disaster seems imminent, Jim joins his captain and other crew members in abandoning the ship and its passengers. A few days later, they are picked up by a British ship. However, the Patna and its passengers are later also saved, and the reprehensible actions of the crew are exposed. The other participants evade the judicial court of inquiry, leaving Jim to the court alone. He is publicly censured for this action and the novel follows his later attempts at coming to terms with his past. The novel is counted as one of 100 best books of the 20th century.<br /><br />Joseph Conrad (1857-1924), was a Polish author who wrote in English after settling in England. Conrad is regarded as one of the greatest novelists in English, though he did not speak the language fluently until he was in his twenties. He wrote stories and novels, often with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of an indifferent universe. He was a master prose stylist who brought a distinctly non-English tragic sensibility into English literature.<br /><br />Contents: <br /><br />Lord Jim<br /><br />Memoirs &amp; Letters:<br /><br />A Personal Record; or Some Reminiscences<br /><br />The Mirror of the Sea<br /><br />Notes on Life &amp; Letters<br /><br />Biography &amp; Critical Essays:<br /><br />Joseph Conrad (A Biography) by Hugh Walpole<br /><br />Joseph Conrad by John Albert Macy<br /><br />A Conrad Miscellany by John Albert Macy<br /><br />Joseph Conrad by Virginia Woolf",

    "description": "Written in a time when criminal biographies enjoyed great success, Daniel Defoe\u2019s <i>Moll Flanders</i> details the life of the irresistible Moll and her struggles through poverty and sin in search of property and power. Born in Newgate Prison to a picaresque mother, Moll propels herself through marriages, periods of success and destitution, and a trip to the New World and back, only to return to the place of her birth as a popular prostitute and brilliant thief. The story of Moll Flanders vividly illustrates Defoe\u2019s themes of social mobility and predestination, sin, redemption and reward. <br /><br />This Modern Library Paperback Classic is set from the 1721 edition printed by Chetwood in London, the only edition approved by Defoe.",

    "description": "In the old century, they called them the Gentry: ancient spirits of the land, magical, amoral, and dangerous. When the Irish emigrated to North America, some of the Gentry followed...only to find that the New World already had spirits of its own, called <i>manitou</i> and other such names by the Native tribes.<br /><br />Now generations have passed, and the Irish have made homes in the new land, but the Gentry still wander homeless on the city streets. Gathering in the city shadows, they bide their time and dream of power. As their dreams grow harder, darker, fiercer, so do the Gentry themselves -- appearing, to those with the sight to see them, as hard and dangerous men, invariably dressed in black.<br /><br />Bettina can see the Gentry, and knows them for what they are. Part Indian, part Mexican, she was raised by her grandmother to understand the spirit world. Now she lives in Kellygnow, a massive old house run as an arts colony on the outskirts of Newford, a world away from the Southwestern desert of her youth. Outside her nighttime window, she often spies the dark men, squatting in the snow, smoking, brooding, waiting. She calls them <i>los lobos</i>, the wolves, and stays clear of them -- until the night one follows her to the woods, and takes her hand....<br /><br />Ellie, and independent young sculptor, is another with magic in her blood, bus she refuses to believe it, even though she, too, sees the dark men. A strange old woman has summoned Ellie to Kellygnow to create a mask for her based on an ancient Celtic artifact. It is the mask of the mythic Summer King -- another thing that Ellie does not believe in. Yet lack of belief won't dim the power of the mask, or its dreadful intent.<br /><br />Once again Charles de Lint weaves the mythic traditions of many cultures into a seamless cloth, bringing folklore, music, and unforgettable characters to life on modern city streets.",

In a late-night showdown after a near-fatal car chase, San Francisco police lieutenant Lindsay Boxer has to make an instantaneous decision: in self-defense, she fires her weapon-and sets off a chain of events that leaves a police force disgraced, an entire city divided, and a family destroyed. Now everything she's worked her entire life for hinges on the decision of twelve jurors. To escape scrutiny during breaks from her trial, Lindsay retreats to the picturesque town of Half Moon Bay.<p>But soon after her arrival, a string of grisly murders punches through the peaceful community. There are no witnesses and there is no discernible pattern. But a key detail recalls a case Lindsay worked on as a rookie years before-an unsolved murder that has haunted her ever since. As summer comes into full swing, Lindsay and her friends in the Women's Murder Club battle for her life on two fronts: before a judge and jury as her trial comes to a climax, and facing unknown adversaries who will do anything to keep her from the truth about the killings-including killing again.</p><p>James Patterson fine-tunes the tension as never before in this breathtaking addition to the best-selling detective series to debut in a decade.</p>",

Now that Lizzie has been promoted, can she still keep her pumps firmly on the ground in the city of stars? With a viperish subordinate after her job, the world?s hottest teen starlet to keep out of trouble and a boyfriend on location with a beautiful actress, she certainly has her hands full. <br /><br /> The satire is sharper than ever as Naylor and Hare take another wry and hilarious look at the wheeling, dealing, schmoozing, and snubbing that make Hollywood the cutthroat capital of the world. <i>The First Assistant</i> is a lesson in how to survive in a town where tonight?s Oscar frock is tomorrow?s laughing stock.",

    "description": "<b>The Barnes &amp; Noble Review - La Musa de la Patria</b> <p> In recent years, novelists Mona Simpson (<i>Anywhere But Here</i>), Karla Kuban (<i>Marchlands</i>) and Susannah Moore (<i>My Old Sweetheart</i>), among numerous others, have memorably explored the mother-daughter relationship, showing us the conflicted, often painful intersections of the lives of their multigenerational characters. But in Julia Alvarez's new novel, <i>In the Name of Salome</i>, the mother, Dominican poet and political muse Salom\u00e9 Ure\u00f1a, only lives long enough to hear her three-year-old daughter Camila recite one of her consumptive mother's poems. What we get, then, is a compelling work of fiction based on remarkably tireless research and shaped by Camila's reach into the past, into her mother's history and her mother's place in history, in order to make sense of the choices she has made about her own. </p><p> A masterful manipulator of time, Alvarez alternates points of view, shuttling us not only back and forth between Salom\u00e9 and Camila, but also moving us forward in Salome's life as she moves us backward in Camila's. Salom\u00e9 writes in secret as a child, publishes briefly under a pseudonym and soon emerges as herself, a figure of inspiration for a nation. But all the while she longs for that other kind of passion, the one her family and her readers would like to believe she is above: the passionate love of a man. Sadly, though she finds that love in Papancho, he is never fully hers. He belongs in turn to his country, to his studies, and inevitably to another woman. How Salom\u00e9 withstands losing this managain andagain has to do with what we all withstand \u0097 wisely and unwisely \u0097 in the name of love. </p><p> Camila writes poetry only as a mature woman. As a child her life is shaped by the political values that shape Papancho's life. Those values find only cautious expression in the U.S. where she studies at the University of Minnesota and later becomes a professor at Vassar. But in Cuba, where she spends the last 13 years of her life, she fulfills the dream of both her mother and father as a vital and dedicated participant in Fidel Castro's \"revolutionary experiment.\" </p><p> Through skillful mechanics Alvarez makes characters of time itself and the history that marks it. And what troubling history it is, spanning over 100 years (1856-1973) in the life of the Dominican Republic, where the government changes hands with as much frequency as a se\u00f1orita changes her linens, and \"Depending on the president, the pantheon of heroes changes, one regime's villain is the next one's hero, until the word <i>hero</i>, like the word <i>patria</i>, begins to mean nothing.\". </p><p> But if history renders language meaningless, what is left? Only the struggle to make meaning, and only love makes that struggle real and worthwhile; on this matter mother and daughter agree. So this is also a love story, in which Salom\u00e9 discovers that she will give up everything \u0097 her writing, her social activism, finally her health \u0097 for the man she loves, and Camilla discovers that she will sacrifice her secure teaching position in the U.S., the approval of family, friends and erstwhile lovers for the very thing her mother's passionate poetry taught her: love for the land and the people who give life to it. </p><p> Alvarez's skillful prose styling distinguishes the two women not only through the details of their lives but also through their meticulously wrought voices. Moreover, just as interesting as what distinguishes them from one another is what unites them: the pull of public life on their private lives and the challenges presented by the conventions that govern their lives as women. And they and we thrill equally to the ultimate discovery we're all reaching for, \"that hushed and holy moment...when the word becomes flesh.\" </p><p> In a book rich in extended metaphor, where poetry and idealism play a huge role, we are never encumbered with abstraction. This is a writer going at full tilt: wry, wise, ironic, forgiving. She, like both the women of this novel, is an educator, though neither didactic nor condescending. Even though we know from the beginning the details about the end of both mother's and daughter's lives, Alvarez manages to sustain an air of suspense throughout, the point being not what happens, but how it comes about, and at what cost. </p><p> <i>Susan Thames is the author of a book of short stories, AS MUCH AS I KNOW. Her novel </i>I'll Be Home Late Tonight was a Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Great New Writers selection.</p>",

All of them have something to hide\u2014if not from the Nazis, then from their fellow detainees and, inevitably, from themselves. For in this claustrophobic antechamber to the death camps, everyone is guilty. And perhaps none more so than those who can walk away alive.In <b>Incident at Vichy</b>, Arthur Miller re-creates Dante's hell inside the gaping pit that is our history and populates it with sinners whose crimes are all the more fearful because they are so recognizable.<br /><br />\"One of the most important plays of our time . . . <b>Incident at Vichy</b> returns the theater to greatness.\" \u2014<b>The New York Times</b>",

Here, Johnston brings to life a breathtaking love story - between the Blackthornes' oldest son and the Creeds' beautiful daughter - a magnificent novel of passion, vengeance, and star-crossed love.<p>Trace Blackthorne was taught from the cradle to take what he wanted. And he wanted Callie Creed. Eleven years ago, the feud between their families had torn them apart. But now Trace has come home, a ruthless hard-eyed stranger, making her an offer she couldn't refuse: marry him and save her struggling family from financial ruin. But the secrets of the past return to haunt them. And Callie is once again compelled to make an impossible choice - between the family who desperately needs her and the only man she has ever loved.</p>",

Set in the heart of the modern-day West, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Joan Johnston brings to passionate life the clash of wills between Blackthorne and Creed . . . as a man and woman discover a love stronger than the forces trying to tear them apart.<br /><br />Summer Blackthorne swore she'd never forgive Billy Coburn for running out on her and their future together. But that was before she found out she wasn't Jackson Blackthorne's child-Billy was. And now the \"Blackthorne Bastard\" has come home for a final day of reckoning...to the town that damned him and the woman he had always wanted. Only Summer can satisfy the hunger burning deep within him. Only she can help him hold on to his own unwanted son. It will be a marriage of expedience only. Until doubts and mistrust vanish in the heat of passion...and a man and a woman who never stopped loving each other fight bitter blood and impossible odds for a glorious second chance....",

But Sloan, eldest daughter of a wealthy cotton planter, belonged to another man--until the day she came to him, a woman in trouble on the lawless frontier ...and he made her an offer she could not refuse. Now he is ready to claim what is rightfully his--even as a long-ago betrayal threatens to tear her from his arms forever.<br /><br />Sloan swore never to be used by a man again. Only sheer desperation made her strike a bargain with the aristocratic nobleman. Now he has come to collect on the vow they made together, seducing her with tender words, determined to make her want him as he wants her. Caught in the bitter cross fire of a traitorous enemy and an embattled republic, a man bound by honor and a woman wounded by passion must dare to trust in a love that's strong and wild and true...",

    "description": "W.G. Sebald completed this controversial book before his death in December 2001. <i>On the Natural History of Destruction</i> is his harrowing and precise investigation of one of the least examined silences of our time. In it, the novelist examines the devastation of German cities by Allied bombardment and the reasons for the astonishing absence of this unprecedented trauma from German history and culture. This historical void is in part a repression of things -- such as the death by fire of the city of Hamburg at the hands of the RAF -- too terrible to bear. But rather than record the crises about them, writers sought to retrospectively justify their actions under the Nazis. For Sebald, this is an example of deliberate cultural amnesia. His analysis of its effects in and outside Germany has already provoked angry painful debate.<br /><br />Sebald's novels are rooted in meticulous observation. His essays are novelistic. They include his childhood recollections of the war that spurred his horror at the collective amnesia around him. There are moments of black humor and, throughout, the sensitivity of his intelligence. This book is a study of suffering and forgetting, of the morality hidden in artistic decisions, and of both compromised and genuine heroics.",

    "description": "\"A German cruise ship turned refugee carrier, it was attacked by a Soviet submarine in January 1945. Some 9,000 people went down in the Baltic Sea, making it the deadliest maritime disaster of all time.\" Born to an unwed mother on a lifeboat the night of the attack, Paul Pokriefke is a middle-aged journalist trying to piece together the tragic events. While his mother sees her whole existence in terms of that calamitous moment, Paul wishes their life could have been less touched by the past. For his teenage son, who dabbles in the dark, far-right corners of the Internet, the Gustloff embodies the denial of Germany's wartime suffering.",

    "description": "A naive girl from a humble background meets an ambitious city boy, and a torrid romance ensues. Despite her pride, independence, and honesty, Charity Royall feels shadowed by her past--especially in her ardent relationship with the educated and refined Lucius Harney. Can passion overcome the effects of heredity and environment?<br /><br />With its frank treatment of a woman's sexual awakening, <i>Summer</i> created a sensation upon its 1917 publication. Edith Wharton \u2014 the author of <i>Ethan Frome</i> and a peerless observer and chronicler of society \u2014 completely shattered the standards of conventional love stories with this novel's candor and realism. The Pulitzer Prize-winning author declared <i>Summer</i> a personal favorite among her works, and liked to refer to it as \"the Hot Ethan.\" Over a century later, it remains fresh and relevant.",

    "description": "It's Clean. It's Simple. It's pure Cathy. And it's still totally cool. Cathy Zielske, creative director for Simple Scrapbooks magazine, is back with the sequel to her best-selling book, Clean&amp;Simple Scrapbooking. In her new book, she revisits the core tenets of the hobby: telling good stories, making well-designed pages, letting go of unrealistic expectations, and remembering to have a really good time while you're at it. She reminds us that scrapbooking isn't an obligation, but an opportunity to capture the bits and pieces that make up our lives. From scrapbooking about her intense love of paper towels to her obsession with heavily-tattooed rock stars, Cathy throws open the window on her life and shares how she chooses to record it. You'll laugh, connect, and be inspired to record your own life with pictures, paper, adhesive and above all, authenticity.",

    "description": "Charles Haddon Spurgeon's classic Morning and Evening collection of daily devotionals was written in England more than a century ago. For generations, its cherished gems of daily strength and meditation inspired millions. However, in recent times, its archaic words, English spellings, and 19th-century expressions had become a barrier to many of today's readers and had obscured the vitality of this magnificent volume. In this new revised and updated version, Spurgeon's work is returned to its former brilliance and polish. The language has been remarkably updated without losing Spurgeon's knack for writing the well-turned phrase with well-chosen words. His themes emerge as fresh and relevant to our day as they were in his day. Urban poverty, troubling foreign political events, the role of church and state, troubling developments in public education - these issues were as much in his thoughts and prayers as they are in ours today. Morning and Evening offers two devotionals a day that will take you on an inspirational, year-long journey through every part of God's Word. It's a work that stands ready to help in your daily walk of faith in a language that a new generation can understand.",

    "description": "Once and Always, one of Judith McNaught's most masterful and moving love stories, powerfully brings to life the fiery passion of a free-spirited American beauty and a troubled English lord.<br /><br />Suddenly orphaned and alone, Victoria Seaton sails the vast ocean, eager to reclaim her heritage at Wakefield, the sumptuous English estate of a distant cousin, the notorious Lord Jason Fielding. Bewildered by his arrogance yet drawn to his panther-like grace, she senses the painful memories that smolder in his eyes. When he gathers her at last into his arms, arousing a sweet, insistent hunger, they wed and are embraced by fierce, consuming joy -- free from the past's cruel grasp. Then, in a moment of anguish, Victoria discovers the treachery at the heart of their love . . . a love she had dreamed would triumph not just once, but always.",

    "description": "Sheridan Bromleigh had spent most of her early life as a happy vagabond with her unruly American father and his vagrant friends. Then, given over to the care of a strict maiden aunt, she was taught to be a lady\u2014poor but genteel\u2014and finally a teacher. When she was hired to act as chaperone to a pretty but spoilt heiress travelling to England to join an aristocratic fiance, Sheridan was delighted. Now, at last, she could visit her family's country. But somehow everything went wrong.<br /><br />For Miss Charise Lancaster, not over-gifted with intelligence, eloped with a stranger before she could meet her suitor. And Sheridan was left with the horrid task of telling Lord Burleton she had somehow misplaced his bride. As she gazed at the tall, confident man before her, her courage failed. She was doubly shocked when she heard his news. Lord Burleton, a drunkard and a wastrel, had been killed the night before. At which point fate took over. Sheridan was knocked unconscious on the quayside, and recovered to find herself in the handsome stranger's care, not knowing who she was.<br /><br />It was to be the beginning of a dazzling, witty, dramatic, and romantic sequence of events in which every possible confusion was to take place.",

    "description": "As the entire Malory family gathers at Haverston to celebrate the season, a mysterious present arrives anonymously. The gift is an old journal -- a tender and tempestuous account of the love affair between the second Marquis, Christopher Malory, and a dark gypsy beauty named Anastasia, who seeks a love match with a non-gypsy in order to save herself from a prearranged marriage to a brute. Though the dashing English lord Anastasia sets her sight upon burns for the exquisite, exotic miss, Christopher could never consent to wed such a lowborn lady. But miracles have been known to happen in this season of peace and giving and love, as two extraordinary people seperated by cicumstance of birth begin a passionate dance of will and wiles. And in the miraculous blossoming of a glorious romance at a long ago Christmastime, there are wise and well-learned lessons that will enrich the hearts of the Malory descendants -- and, indeed, of everyone who has ever dreamed.",

    "description": "Winner of the <b>National Book Award</b> in 1985, <b>White Noise</b> is the story of Jack and Babette and their children from their six or so various marriages. They live in a college town where Jack is Professor of Hitler Studies (and conceals the fact that he does not speak a word of German), and Babette teaches posture and volunteers by reading from the tabloids to a group of elderly shut-ins. They are happy enough until a deadly toxic accident and Babette's addiction to an experimental drug make Jake question everything.<b>White Noise</b> is considered a postmodern classic and its unfolding of themes of consumerism, family and divorce, and technology as a deadly threat have attracted the attention of literary scholars since its publication. This Viking Critical Library edition, prepared by scholar Mark Osteen, is the only edition of <b>White Noise</b> that contains the entire text along with an extensive critical apparatus, including a critical introduction, selected essays on the author, the work and its themes, reviews, a chronology of DeLillo's life and work, a list of discussion topics, and a selected bibliography.",

Happy in her marriage, she tries to look the other way when her genial husband, Alec, takes to the bottle. When Elspeth, Margaret's sister, comes to live with them, the young woman is immediately captivated by the beauty and vitality of the farm, and by the affection she receives from those around her. But as summer turns into fall, and the friendship between Alec and Elspeth deepens, Margaret finds her spirit tested by a series of events that seem as cruel and inevitable as the endless prairie winters.Long out of print, <b>Remembering Laughter</b> (1937) marked Wallace Stegner's brilliant literary debut.",

But Leo's mother isn't. She knows her son will do all those things, and more, when he's ready.<br /><br />This heartwarming story of how a little tiger named Leo bloomed is told by bestselling author Robert Kraus and is accompanied by the wonderfully bold illustrations of Jose Aruego.<br /><br />With its message of patience and humor, <em>Leo the Late Bloomer</em> is more timely than ever. As <em>Children's Books and Their Creators</em> commented: \"Leo's reassuring 'I made it!' at the end delights young listeners who may have been scrutinized for early blooming by well-intentioned moms and dads. Deserves space on any parenting shelf.\"",

    "description": "This book is still required reading at Forts Benning and Leavenworth (and some Marine commands), because it fully details the Islamists' yet-to-be-defeated 4GW method. That method is best countered by \"light\" infantry tactics, but America has had only \"line\" infantry since 1943. Its modern sequel travels mostly by truck and fights mostly with supporting arms. That's because the Pentagon still practices a \"higher-tech\" version of 2GW (killing as many enemy as possible). How to operate the latest equipment takes up so much of the young infantryman's day that he never learns how to sneak up on an expert defender. He and his buddies don't become any less visible by donning advanced electronics, so their traditional small-unit maneuvers remain just as predictable. Instead of historical artifacts, all Posterity Press books should be viewed as vehicles of long-overdue change.",

    "description": "View a collection of videos on Professor Wilson entitled \"On the Relation of Science and the Humanities\"<br /><br />Harvard University Press is proud to announce the re-release of the complete original version of <i>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis</i>--now available in paperback for the first time. When this classic work was first published in 1975, it created a new discipline and started a tumultuous round in the age-old nature versus nurture debate. Although voted by officers and fellows of the international Animal Behavior Society the most important book on animal behavior of all time, <i>Sociobiology</i> is probably more widely known as the object of bitter attacks by social scientists and other scholars who opposed its claim that human social behavior, indeed human nature, has a biological foundation. The controversy surrounding the publication of the book reverberates to the present day.<br /><br />In the introduction to this Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Edition, Edward O. Wilson shows how research in human genetics and neuroscience has strengthened the case for a biological understanding of human nature. Human sociobiology, now often called evolutionary psychology, has in the last quarter of a century emerged as its own field of study, drawing on theory and data from both biology and the social sciences.<br /><br />For its still fresh and beautifully illustrated descriptions of animal societies, and its importance as a crucial step forward in the understanding of human beings, this anniversary edition of <i>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis</i> will be welcomed by a new generation of students and scholars in all branches of learning.",

    "description": "<b>The first collection of essays from renowned scientist and best-selling author Richard Dawkins.</b><br /><br />Richard Dawkins's essays are an enthusiastic testament to the power of rigorous, scientific examination, and they span many different corners of his personal and professional life. He revisits the meme, the unit of cultural information that he named and wrote about in his groundbreaking work <i>The Selfish Gene</i>. He makes moving tributes to friends and colleagues, including a eulogy for novelist Douglas Adams; he shares correspondence with the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould; and he visits with the famed paleoanthropologists Richard and Maeve Leakey at their African wildlife preserve. He concludes the essays with a vivid note to his ten-year-old daughter, reminding her to remain curious, to ask questions, and to live the examined life.",

It is a fiction about fiction-writing in which the invented world is as much infused with wit and genius as the theme of inventing it. It is a joyful celebration of the infinite possibilities of the art of fiction, and a wry demonstration of its limitations. This Penguin Classic contains Christopher Ricks's introductory essay, itself a classic of English literary criticism, together with a new introduction on the recent critical history and influence of Tristram Shandy by Melvyn New. The text and notes are based on the acclaimed Florida Edition, making the scholarship of the Florida editors readily available for the first time.",

Hilariously candid, shows that the roller coaster ride of being a teenager is every bit as fun as we remember--and every bit as harrowing.<br /><br />Life is pretty complicated for Elizabeth Clarry. Her best friend Celia keeps disappearing, her absent father suddenly reappears, and her communication with her mother consists entirely of wacky notes left on the fridge. On top of everything else, because her English teacher wants to rekindle the \"Joy of the Envelope,\" a Complete and Utter Stranger knows more about Elizabeth than anyone else. <br /><br />But Elizabeth is on the verge of some major changes. She may lose her best friend, find a wonderful new friend, kiss the sexiest guy alive, and run in a marathon. So much can happen in the time it takes to write a letter\u2026 <br /><br />A #1 bestseller in Australia, this fabulous debut is a funny, touching, revealing story written entirely in the form of letters, messages, postcards - and bizarre missives from imaginary organizations like The Cold Hard Truth Association. <br /><br />Feeling Sorry for Celia captures, with rare acuity, female friendship and the bonding and parting that occurs as we grow. Jaclyn Moriarty's hilariously candid novel shows that the roller coaster ride of being a teenager is every bit as fun as we remember -- and every bit as harrowing.",

She has a pair of size 8 feet and such a fondness for recreational drugs that her family has forked out the cash for a spell in Cloisters \u2013 Dublin\u2019s answer to the Betty Ford Clinic. She\u2019s only agreed to her incarceration because she\u2019s heard that rehab is wall-to-wall jacuzzis, gymnasiums and rock stars going tepid turkey \u2013 and it\u2019s about time she had a holiday.<br /><br />But what Rachel doesn\u2019t count on are the toe-curling embarrassments heaped on her by family and group therapy, the dearth of sex, drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll \u2013 and missing Luke, her ex. What kind of a new start in life is this?",

    "description": "Maggie has always been the white sheep of the Walsh family.Unlike her comically dysfunctional sisters,Rachel(heroine of Rachel's Holiday) and Claire (heroine of Watermelon), she married a decent man who adored her and found herself a solid career. Where Rachel was reckless and Claire dramatic, Maggie settled early for safety. Or so she believed until she discovers that her husband is having an affair and her boss is going to fire her. Suddenly, her perfectly organized life has become a perfect mess.<br /><br />Devastated, she decides the only thing to do is to run for the shelter of her best friend, Emily, who lives in Los Angeles. There, with the help of sunshine and long days at the beach, she will lick her wounds and decide where life will take her next.But from the moment she lands in the City of Angels, things are not quite what she expected. Overnight, she's mixing with movie stars,even pitching film scripts to studios.Most unexpectedly of all,she finds that just because her marriage is over,it doesn't mean her life is. In the end neither the City of Angels nor Maggie Walsh will ever be the same again.",

    "description": "Americans have lost touch with their history, and in <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i> Professor James Loewen shows why. After surveying eighteen leading high school American history texts, he has concluded that not one does a decent job of making history interesting or memorable. Marred by an embarrassing combination of blind patriotism, mindless optimism, sheer misinformation, and outright lies, these books omit almost all the ambiguity, passion, conflict, and drama from our past.<br /><br />In this revised edition, packed with updated material, Loewen explores how historical myths continue to be perpetuated in today's climate and adds an eye-opening chapter on the lies surrounding 9/11 and the Iraq War. From the truth about Columbus's historic voyages to an honest evaluation of our national leaders, Loewen revives our history, restoring the vitality and relevance it truly possesses.<br /><br />Thought provoking, nonpartisan, and often shocking, Loewen unveils the real America in this iconoclastic classic beloved by high school teachers, history buffs, and enlightened citizens across the country.",

    "description": "Janey lived in the locked room. Twice a day the Persian slave trader came in and taught her to be a whore. Otherwise there was nothing. One day she found a pencil stub and scrap of paper in a forgotten corner of the room. She began to write down her life, starting with \"Parents stink\" (her father, who is also her boyfriend, has fallen in love with another woman and is about to leave her). <br /><br />With <i>Blood and Guts in High School</i>, Kathy Acker, whose work has been labeled everything from post-punk porn to post-punk feminism, has created a brilliantly subversive narrative built from conversation, description, conjecture, and moments snatched from history and literature.<br /><br />~ groveatlantic.com",

    "description": "Proust dec\u00eda que todas las novelas de Dostoievski pudieron titularse Crimen y castigo. Efectivamente, la obra entera del gran escritor ruso gira alrededor de dos ideas fundamentales: la transgresi\u00f3n de las leyes morales y sociales, basada en el supuesto de la libertad humana, y el sometimiento posterior e inevitable a dichas leyes, dram\u00e1tica consecuencia de la negaci\u00f3n de esa misma libertad.<br />Sin embargo, es en la presente narraci\u00f3n donde este ciclo de osad\u00eda y arrepentimiento se expresa en su m\u00e1s perfecta forma. Crimen y castigo tiene muy pocos rivales en la novel\u00edstica mundial, y aun se ha juzgado aqu\u00ed al arte de Dostoievski como superior al de un Henry James.",

    "description": "No artist ever led a stranger life than Joseph Cornell, the self-taught American genius prized for his disquieting shadow boxes, who stands at the intersection of Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism and Pop art. Legends about Cornell abound--as the shy hermit, the devoted family caretaker, the artistic innocent--but never before <i>Utopia Parkway</i> has he been presented for what he was: a brilliant, relentlessly serious artist whose stature has now reached monumental proportions. Cornell was haunted by dreams and visions, yet the site of his imaginings couldn't have been more ordinary: a small house he shared with his mother and invalid brother in Queens, New York. In its cluttered basement, he spent his nights arranging photographs, cut-outs and other humble disjecta into some of the most romantic works to exist in three dimensions. Cornell was no recluse, however: admired by successive generations of vanguard artists, he formed friendships with figures as diverse as Duchamp, de Kooning, and Warhol and had romantically charged encounters with Susan Sontag and Yoko Ono--not to mention unrequited crushes on countless shop girls and waitresses. All this he recorded compulsively in a diary that, along with his shadow boxes, forms one of the oddest and most affecting records ever made of a life. It is from such documents, and from a decade of sustained attention to Cornell, that Deborah Solomon has fashioned the definitive biography of one of America's most powerful and unusual modern artists.",

An engraving of a woman giving birth to rabbits, a plague ballad, theological pamphlets, and an articulated skeleton are ingeniously fleshed out into rollicking tales. Whether she's spinning the tale of a soldier tricked into marrying a dowdy spinster, or a Victorian surgeon's attempts to \"improve\" women, Donoghue fills us with the sights and smells of the period as she summons the ghosts of ordinary people, bringing them to unforgettable life in fiction.",

This poignant tribute to the eleven-bedroom jumble of gables, bays, and dormers that watched over weddings, divorces, deaths, anniversaries, birthdays, breakdowns, and love affairs for five generations interweaves Colt's final visit with memories of a lifetime of summers.<br /><br />Run-down yet romantic, <i>The Big House</i> stands not only as a cherished reminder of summer's ephemeral pleasures but also as a powerful symbol of a vanishing way of life.",

Let's thank Mr. and Mrs. Consumer and their little Consumerlings who have seized power from the corporations and are now firmly in control.<br /><br />In <em>Punk Marketing</em>, Laermer and Simmons take an irreverent, penetrating look at the seismic change in the relationship between the people who sell stuff\u2014products, services, entertainment\u2014and those who purchase it. They demonstrate that to survive in business, a revolutionary approach is needed\u2014one they have branded \"Punk Marketing\"\u2014and it's one we all need to understand, for the traditional divisions among commerce, content, and consumers are continuing to blur ever more rapidly.<br /><br />Never dull, sometimes controversial, but always a helluva lot of fun, <em>Punk Marketing</em> presents a manifesto for any businessperson needing to engage consumers\u2014or any consumer seeking to understand and employ their newfound power. And here's the good news: It's based on principles that have existed forever. In an age of digital video recorders, \"branded\" entertainment, cell-phone TV, multiplayer online games, and never-ending social networking, a coherent approach to marketing has never been more vital. With <em>Punk Marketing</em>, there's a built-in plan to equip you with tools to make all this change work out just fine, thanks.<br /><br /><em>Punk Marketing</em> is the first shot\u2014soon to be heard 'round the world\u2014of a long-awaited and breathless uprising that businesses want, deserve, and desperately need.",

Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal - and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. And only the dead are above suspicion.",

She has a small group of like-minded Goth friends who wear black, dabble in the dark arts, and thrive outside the norm. They're considered the \"freaks\" of their high school. But when Jade's smart mouth lands her in trouble -- again -- her principal decides to teach her a lesson she'll never forget. <br /><br /> Taken to a remote location where she is strapped down and sedated, Jade wakes up in an alternate universe where she rules the school. But her best friends won't talk to her, and the people she used to hate are all Goth. Only Clarik, the mysterious new boy in town, operates outside all the cliques. And only Mercedes, the Barbie clone Jade loathes, believes that Jade's stuck in a virtual reality game -- because she's stuck there, too, now living the life of a \"freak.\" Together, they realize they might never get back to reality...and that even if they do, things might never be the same.",

    "description": "In August 1984, Michigan housewife Betty Mahmoody accompanied her husband to his native Iran for a two-week vacation. To her horror, she found herself and her four-year-old daughter, Mahtob, virtual prisoners of a man rededicated to his Shiite Moslem faith, in a land where women are near-slaves and Americans are despised. Their only hope for escape lay in a dangerous underground that would not take her child...<br /><br />Now the true story of this courageous woman and her breathtaking odyssey bursts upon the screen in the Pathe Entertainment production starring Academy Award-winner Sally Field!<br />(back cover)",

Could the town prattle actually ring true? Are they vampires? Raven, who secretly covets a vampire kiss, both at the risk of her own mortality and Alexander's loving trust, is dying to uncover the truth. </p><p>Ellen Schreiber's spooky and stirring romance tells the story of two outsiders who fall in love in a town where conformity reigns, and ends with a shocking surprise.</p>",

Expedition leader Arlene Blum here tells their dramatic story: the logistical problems, storms, and hazardous ice climbing; the conflicts and reconciliations within the team; the terror of avalanches that threatened to sweep away camps and climbers.<br />On October 15, two women and two Sherpas at last stood on the summit\u2014but the celebration was cut short, for two days later, the two women of the second summit team fell to their deaths.<br />Never before has such an account of mountaineering triumph and tragedy been told from a woman\u2019s point of view. By proving that women had the skill, strength, and courage necessary to make this difficult and dangerous climb, the 1978 Women's Himalayan Expedition\u2019s accomplishment had a positive impact around the world, changing perceptions about women\u2019s abilities in sports and other arenas. And <i>Annapurna: A Woman\u2019s Place</i> has become an acknowledged classic in the annals of women\u2019s achievements\u2014a story of challenge and commitment told with passion, humor, and unflinching honesty.",

    "description": "Shel Silverstein shook the staid world of children's poetry in 1974 with the publication of this collection, and things haven't been the same since. More than four and a half million copies of <i>Where the Sidewalk Ends</i> have been sold, making it the bestselling children's poetry book ever. With this and his other poetry collections (<i>A Light in the Attic</i> and <i>Falling Up</i>), Silverstein reveals his genius for reaching kids with silly words and simple pen-and-ink drawings. What child can resist a poem called \"Dancing Pants\" or \"The Dirtiest Man in the World\"? Each of the 130 poems is funny in a different way, or touching ... or both. Some approach naughtiness or are a bit disgusting to squeamish grown-ups, but that's exactly what kids like best about Silverstein's work. Jim Trelease, author of <i>The New Read-Aloud Handbook,</i> calls this book \"without question, the best-loved collection of poetry for children.\" <i>(Ages 4 to 10)</i>",

    "description": "Without risk, say mountaineers, there would be none of the self-knowledge that comes from pushing life to its extremes. For them, perhaps, it is worth the cost. But when tragedy strikes, what happens to the people left behind? Why would anyone choose to invest in a future with a high-altitude risk-taker? What is life like in the shadow of the mountain? Such questions have long been taboo in the world of mountaineering. Now, the spouses, parents and children of internationally renowned climbers finally break their silence, speaking out about the dark side of adventure.<br /><br />Maria Coffey confronted one of the harshest realities of mountaineering when her partner Joe Tasker disappeared on the Northeast Ridge of Everest in 1982. In <i>Where the Mountain Casts Its Shadow</i>, Coffey offers an intimate portrait of adventure and the conflicting beauty, passion, and devastation of this alluring obsession. Through interviews with the world's top climbers, or their widows and families-Jim Wickwire, Conrad Anker, Lynn Hill, Joe Simpson, Chris Bonington, Ed Viesturs, Anatoli Boukreev, Alex Lowe, and many others-she explores what compels men and women to give their lives to the high mountains. She asks why, despite the countless tragedies, the world continues to laud their exploits. With an insider's understanding, Coffey reveals the consequences of loving people who pursue such risk-the exhilarating highs and inevitable lows, the stress of long separations, the constant threat of bereavement, and the lives shattered in the wake of climbing accidents.<br /><br /><i>Where the Mountain Casts Its Shadow</i> is a powerful, affecting and important book that exposes the far reaching personal costs of extreme adventure.",

    "description": "Published when Truman Capote was only twenty-three years old, <i>Other Voices, Other Rooms</i> is a literary touchstone of the mid-twentieth century. In this semiautobiographical coming-of-age novel, thirteen-year-old Joel Knox, after losing his mother, is sent from New Orleans to live with the father who abandoned him at birth. But when Joel arrives at Skully\u2019s Landing, the decaying mansion in rural Alabama, his father is nowhere to be found. Instead, Joel meets his morose stepmother, Amy, eccentric cousin Randolph, and a defiant little girl named Idabel, who soon offers Joel the love and approval he seeks.<br /><br />Fueled by a world-weariness that belied Capote\u2019s tender age, this novel tempers its themes of waylaid hopes and lost innocence with an appreciation for small pleasures and the colorful language of its time and place.<br /><br />This new edition, featuring an enlightening Introduction by John Berendt, offers readers a fresh look at Capote\u2019s emerging brilliance as a writer of protean power and effortless grace.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

A seductive con artiste stumbles into a scam that promises more cool cash than the lottery. A shotgun-toting mobile home salesman is about to close a deal with disaster. A law school dropout will be chasing one Gaboon viper, a troop of storm-shocked monkeys, and a newfound love life, while tourists by the thousands bail from the Florida Keys. We're now entering the hurricane zone, where hell and hilarity rule. And in the hands of the masterful, merciless Carl Hiaasen, we're going to have some weather.<br />",

    "description": "This is the life and times of T. S. Garp, the bastard son of Jenny Fields--a feminist leader ahead of her times. This is the life and death of a famous mother and her almost-famous son; theirs is a world of sexual extremes--even of sexual assassinations. It is a novel rich with \"lunacy and sorrow\"; yet the dark, violent events of the story do not undermine a comedy both ribald and robust. In more than thirty languages, in more than forty countries--with more than ten million copies in print--this novel provides almost cheerful, even hilarious evidence of its famous last line: \"In the world according to Garp, we are all terminal cases.\"<br /><br /><i>The World According to Garp</i> is a comic and compassionate coming-of-age novel that established John Irving as one of the most imaginative writers of his generation. A worldwide bestseller since its publication in 1978, Irving's classic is filled with stories inside stories about the life and times of T. S. Garp, novelist and bastard son of Jenny Fields--a feminist leader ahead of her time. Beyond that, <i>The World According to Garp</i> virtually defies synopsis.<br /><br />(From author's website: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.john-irving.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.john-irving.com</a>)",

    "description": "Like Frida Kahlo and Georgia O'Keefee, Diane Arbus exerts a fascination rooted in both her art and her life. Her startling photographic images of dwarfs, twins, transvestites, and freaks seemed from the first to redefine both the normal and the abnormal in our lives and they were already becoming part of the iconography of the age when Arbus committed suicide in 1971. Arbus herself remained an enigma until the publication of this first full biography. Patricia Bosworth examines the life behind the eerie, mesmerizing photographs: Diane's pampered childhood; her passionate marriage to Allan Arbus and their work together as fashion photographers during the fifties; the emotional upheaval surrounding the end of that marriage; and the radically dark, liberating, and ultimately tragic turn Diane's art took during the sixties. Bosworth's engrossing book is a compassionate portrait of the woman behind some of the most powerful photographs of our time.",

    "description": "<b>The definitive refutation to the argument of The Bell Curve.</b><br /><br />How smart are you? If that question doesn't spark a dozen more questions in your mind (like \"What do you mean by 'smart,'\" \"How do I measure it\" and \"Who's asking?\"), then <i>The Mismeasure of Man</i>, Stephen Jay Gould's masterful demolition of the IQ industry, should be required reading. Gould's brilliant, funny, engaging prose dissects the motivations behind those who would judge intelligence, and hence worth, by cranial size, convolutions, or score on extremely narrow tests. How did scientists decide that intelligence was unipolar and quantifiable? Why did the standard keep changing over time? Gould's answer is clear and simple: power maintains itself. European men of the 19th century, even before Darwin, saw themselves as the pinnacle of creation and sought to prove this assertion through hard measurement. When one measure was found to place members of some \"inferior\" group such as women or Southeast Asians over the supposedly rightful champions, it would be discarded and replaced with a new, more comfortable measure. The 20th-century obsession with numbers led to the institutionalization of IQ testing and subsequent assignment to work (and rewards) commensurate with the score, shown by Gould to be not simply misguided--for surely intelligence is multifactorial--but also regressive, creating a feedback loop rewarding the rich and powerful. The revised edition includes a scathing critique of Herrnstein and Murray's <i>The Bell Curve</i>, taking them to task for rehashing old arguments to exploit a new political wave of uncaring belt tightening. It might not make you any smarter, but <i>The Mismeasure of Man</i> will certainly make you think.--Rob Lightner",

Nearly all of Earth's 75 billion live in the hundreds of monolithic structures scattered across the globe, with the exception of the small agricultural communes that supply the Urbmons with food. When a restless Urbmon computer engineer begins to think unblessworthy thoughts of making a trip outside, he risks being labeled a flippo, for whom there is only one punishment.",

    "description": "The 2003 Iraq war remains among the most mysterious armed conflicts of modernity. In <b>The Iraq War</b><i>, </i>John Keegan offers a sharp and lucid appraisal of the military campaign, explaining just how the coalition forces defeated an Iraqi army twice its size and addressing such questions as whether Saddam Hussein ever possessed weapons of mass destruction and how it is possible to fight a war that is not, by any conventional measure, a war at all.<br /><br />Drawing on exclusive interviews with Donald Rumsfeld and General Tommy Franks, Keegan retraces the steps that led to the showdown in Iraq, from the highlights of Hussein\u2019s murderous rule to the diplomatic crossfire that preceded the invasion. His account of the combat in the desert is unparalleled in its grasp of strategy and tactics. The result is an urgently needed and up-to-date book that adds immeasurably to our understanding of those twenty-one days of war and their long, uncertain aftermath.",

    "description": "In his final book and his first full-length original title since <b>Full House</b> in 1996, the eminent paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould offers a surprising and nuanced study of the complex relationship between our two great ways of knowing: science and the humanities, twin realms of knowledge that have been divided against each other for far too long. In building his case, Gould shows why the common assumption of an inescapable conflict between science and the humanities is false, mounts a spirited rebuttal to the ideas that his intellectual rival E. O. Wilson set forth in his book <b>Consilience</b>, and explains why the pursuit of knowledge must always operate upon the bedrock of nature' s randomness. <b>The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister\u2019s Pox</b> is a controversial discourse, rich with facts and observations gathered by one of the most erudite minds of our time.",

    "description": "\"A dazzling journey across the sciences and humanities in search of deep laws to unite them.\" --<b>The Wall Street Journal</b>\u00a0<br /><br />One of our greatest living scientists--and the winner of two Pulitzer Prizes for\u00a0<b>On Human Nature</b>\u00a0and\u00a0<b>The Ants</b>--gives us a work of visionary importance that may be the crowning achievement of his career. In\u00a0<b>Consilience</b>\u00a0\u00a0(a word that originally meant \"jumping together\"), Edward O. Wilson renews the Enlightenment's search for a unified theory of knowledge in disciplines that range from physics to biology, the social sciences and the humanities.<br /><br />Using the natural sciences as his model, Wilson forges dramatic links between fields. He explores the chemistry of the mind and the genetic bases of culture. He postulates the biological principles underlying works of art from cave-drawings to Lolita. Presenting the latest findings in prose of wonderful clarity and oratorical eloquence, and synthesizing it into a dazzling whole,\u00a0<b>Consilience</b>\u00a0is science in the path-clearing traditions of Newton, Einstein, and Richard Feynman.",

    "description": "\"The philosophy of mind is unique among contemporary philosophical subjects,\" writes John Searle, \"in that all of the most famous and influential theories are false.\" One of the world's most eminent thinkers, Searle dismantles these theories as he presents a vividly written, comprehensive introduction to the mind. He begins with a look at the twelve problems of philosophy of mind--which he calls \"Descartes and Other Disasters\"--problems which he returns to throughout the volume, as he illuminates such topics as materialism, consciousness, the mind-body problem, intentionality, mental causation, free will, and the self. The book offers a refreshingly direct and engaging introduction to one of the most intriguing areas of philosophy.<br />",

    "description": "What is consciousness? How do physical processes in the brain give rise to the self-aware mind and to feelings as profoundly varied as love or hate, aesthetic pleasure or spiritual yearning? These questions today are among the most hotly debated issues among scientists and philosophers, and we have seen in recent years superb volumes by such eminent figures as Francis Crick, Daniel C. Dennett, Gerald Edelman, and Roger Penrose, all firing volleys in what has come to be called the consciousness wars. Now, in <i>The Conscious Mind</i>, philosopher David J. Chalmers offers a cogent analysis of this heated debate as he unveils a major new theory of consciousness, one that rejects the prevailing reductionist trend of science, while offering provocative insights into the relationship between mind and brain.<br />Writing in a rigorous, thought-provoking style, the author takes us on a far-reaching tour through the philosophical ramifications of consciousness. Chalmers convincingly reveals how contemporary cognitive science and neurobiology have failed to explain how and why mental events emerge from physiological occurrences in the brain. He proposes instead that conscious experience must be understood in an entirely new light--as an irreducible entity (similar to such physical properties as time, mass, and space) that exists at a fundamental level and cannot be understood as the sum of its parts. And after suggesting some intriguing possibilities about the structure and laws of conscious experience, he details how his unique reinterpretation of the mind could be the focus of a new science. Throughout the book, Chalmers provides fascinating thought experiments that trenchantly illustrate his ideas. For example, in exploring the notion that consciousness could be experienced by machines as well as humans, Chalmers asks us to imagine a thinking brain in which neurons are slowly replaced by silicon chips that precisely duplicate their functions--as the neurons are replaced, will consciousness gradually fade away? The book also features thoughtful discussions of how the author's theories might be practically applied to subjects as diverse as artificial intelligence and the interpretation of quantum mechanics.<br />All of us have pondered the nature and meaning of consciousness. Engaging and penetrating, <i>The Conscious Mind</i> adds a fresh new perspective to the subject that is sure to spark debate about our understanding of the mind for years to come.",

    "description": "A manifesto by America's most controversial and celebrated town planners, proposing an alternative model for community design.<br /><br />There is a growing movement in North America to put an end to suburban sprawl and to replace the automobile-based settlement patterns of the past fifty years with a return to more traditional planning principles. This movement stems not only from the realization that sprawl is ecologically and economically unsustainable but also from a growing awareness of sprawl's many victims: children, utterly dependent on parental transportation if they wish to escape the cul-de-sac; the elderly, warehoused in institutions once they lose their driver's licenses; the middle class, stuck in traffic for two or more hours each day.<br /><br />Founders of the Congress for the New Urbanism, Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk are at the forefront of this movement, and in Suburban Nation they assess sprawl's costs to society, be they ecological, economic, aesthetic, or social. It is a lively, thorough, critical lament, and an entertaining lesson on the distinctions between postwar suburbia-characterized by housing clusters, strip shopping centers, office parks, and parking lots-and the traditional neighborhoods that were built as a matter of course until mid-century. It is an indictment of the entire development community, including governments, for the fact that America no longer builds towns. Most important, though, it is that rare book that also offers solutions.",

    "description": "<i>Asphalt Nation</i> is a powerful examination of how the automobile has ravaged America's cities and landscape over the past 100 years together with a compelling strategy for reversing our automobile dependency. Jane Holtz Kay provides a history of the rapid spread of the automobile and documents the huge subsidies commanded by the highway lobby, to the detriment of once-efficient forms of mass transportation. Demonstrating that there are economic, political, architectural, and personal solutions to the problem, she shows that radical change is entirely possible. This book is essential reading for everyone interested in the history of our relationship with the car, and in the prospect of returning to a world of human mobility.",

The reward? An adventure that Eben's been craving -- a trip to Colorado. <br /><br /> Even doesn't think he'll have any luck -- he can't think of one single thing that could be considered wondrous in Sassafras -- but he's willing to try. Little does he know that the Wonders he'll discover among his neighbors, friends, relatives, and family will give him the adventure of a lifetime...without ever leaving his home.",

    "description": "In this pithy and hilarious book, Karl Pilkington is in conversation with (the often bewildered) Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, the writers and stars of <em>The Office</em> and <em>Extras</em>, unwittingly outwitting even those comedy Goliaths as he struggles in vain to make sense of the world around him. Unencumbered by erudition and impervious to logic, Karl ambles down a heuristic path to enlightenment under the edifying influence of Ricky and Steve. His pronouncements on such diverse and contentious topics as population control, simian affairs within human society, the sartorial deliberations of solitary spacemen and how long you can stay alive with your head chopped off, are matched in the vehemence with which they are proposed only by the degree to which they are ill-conceived. Featuring Karl's original illustrations, imaginative scribblings and the best conversations of the world record-breaking Podcasts, <em>The Ricky Gervais Show</em>, this is a unique trip into the world of one of our most innovative thinkers, visionaries and prophets, or as Gervais knows him, \"the funniest man I've ever met.\"",

    "description": "Set in 14th-century England, Avi's (The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle) 50th book begins with a funeral, that of a village outcast whose past is shrouded in mystery and whose adolescent son is known only as \"Asta's son.\" Mired in grief for his mother, the boy learns his given name, Crispin, from the village priest, although his presumably dead father's identity remains obscure. The words etched on his mother's treasured lead cross may provide some clue, but the priest is murdered before he can tell the illiterate lad what they say. Worse, Crispin is fingered for the murder by the manor steward, who declares him a \"wolf's head\" wanted dead or alive, preferably dead. Crispin flees, and falls in with a traveling juggler. \"I have no name,\" Crispin tells Bear, whose rough manners and appearance mask a tender heart. \"No home, no kin, no place in this world.\" How the boy learns his true identity (he's the bastard son of the lord of the manor) and finds his place in the world makes for a rattling fine yarn. Avi's plot is engineered for maximum thrills, with twists, turns and treachery aplenty, but it's the compellingly drawn relationship between Crispin and Bear that provides the heart of this story.",

Had he been able to resist his fatal psychosexual attraction?<br /><br /><br />What of Sasha, the dashing, prize-winning French novelist with writers block and a penchant for exploiting women? In the end, did his art prevail or his life?<br /><br /><br />And what became of Mary--did she ever \"murder\" again?<br /><br /><br />Like a brilliant psychological detective novel, this book tells its stories in fascinating detail while raising fundamental questions about psychotherapy.<br />",

    "description": "In a book that completely changes the terms of the pornography debate, Laura Kipnis challenges the position that porn perpetuates misogyny and sex crimes. First published in 1996, <i>Bound and Gagged</i> opens with the chilling case of Daniel DePew, a man convicted\u2014in the first computer bulletin board entrapment case\u2014of conspiring to make a snuff film and sentenced to thirty-three years in prison for merely trading kinky fantasies with two undercover cops.<br />Using this textbook example of social hysteria as a springboard, Kipnis argues that criminalizing fantasy\u2014even perverse and unacceptable fantasy\u2014has dire social consequences. Exploring the entire spectrum of pornography, she declares that porn isn\u2019t just about gender and that fantasy doesn\u2019t necessarily constitute intent. She reveals Larry Flynt\u2019s <i>Hustler</i> to be one of the most politically outspoken and class-antagonistic magazine in the country and shows how fetishes such as fat admiration challenge our aesthetic prejudices and socially sanctioned disgust. Kipnis demonstrates that the porn industry\u2014whose multibillion-dollar annual revenues rival those of the three major television networks combined\u2014know precisely how to tap into our culture\u2019s deepest anxieties and desires, and that this knowledge, more than all the naked bodies, is what guarantees its vast popularity.<br /><i>Bound and Gagged</i> challenges our most basic assumptions about America\u2019s relationship with pornography and questions what the calls to eliminate it are really attempting to protect.",

Comprising a range of voices from both within and outside the academy, this collection draws from traditional feminisms, postmodern feminism, queer theory, libertarianism, and sex radicalism. Through essay and personal narrative, the contributors liberate the exchange of sex for money from its arranged ideological marriage with sexist oppression, highlighting instead more local questions about particular sex work practices and their interface with feminist thought.",

    "description": "Did Newton \"unweave the rainbow\" by reducing it to its prismatic colors, as Keats contended? Did he, in other words, diminish beauty? Far from it, says acclaimed scientist Richard Dawkins; Newton's unweaving is the key to much of modern astronomy and to the breathtaking poetry of modern cosmology. Mysteries don't lose their poetry because they are solved: the solution often is more beautiful than the puzzle, uncovering deeper mysteries. With the wit, insight, and spellbinding prose that have made him a best-selling author, Dawkins takes up the most important and compelling topics in modern science, from astronomy and genetics to language and virtual reality, combining them in a landmark statement of the human appetite for wonder.<br /> This is the book Richard Dawkins was meant to write: a brilliant assessment of what science is (and isn't), a tribute to science not because it is useful but because it is uplifting.",

    "description": "The renowned biologist and thinker Richard Dawkins presents his most expansive work yet: a comprehensive look at evolution, ranging from the latest developments in the field to his own provocative views. Loosely based on the form of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Dawkins's Tale takes us modern humans back through four billion years of life on our planet. As the pilgrimage progresses, we join with other organisms at the forty \"rendezvous points\" where we find a common ancestor. The band of pilgrims swells into a vast crowd as we join first with other primates, then with other mammals, and so on back to the first primordial organism.<br /><br />Dawkins's brilliant, inventive approach allows us to view the connections between ourselves and all other life in a bracingly novel way. It also lets him shed bright new light on the most compelling aspects of evolutionary history and theory: sexual selection, speciation, convergent evolution, extinction, genetics, plate tectonics, geographical dispersal, and more. The Ancestor's Tale is at once a far-reaching survey of the latest, best thinking on biology and a fascinating history of life on Earth. Here Dawkins shows us how remarkable we are, how astonishing our history, and how intimate our relationship with the rest of the living world.",

    "description": "<b>In <i>Climbing Mount Improbable</i>, Richard Dawkins, author of <i>The God Delusion</i>, builds a powerful and carefully reasoned argument for evolutionary adaptation as the force behind all life on earth. </b><br /><br />What drives species to evolve? How can intricate structures such as the human eye, the spider's web or the wings of birds develop, seemingly by chance? Regarding evolution's most complex achievements as peaks on a metaphorical mountain, <i>Climbing Mount Improbable</i> reveals the ways in which the theory of natural selection can precisely explain the beautiful, bizarre and seemingly 'designed' complexity of living things.<br /><br />And through it all runs the thread of DNA, the molecule of life, responsible for its own destiny on an unending pilgrimage through time. Accompanied by evocative illustrations, Dawkins's eloquent descriptions of the living world's astonishing adaptations throw back the curtain on the mysteries of 'Mount Improbable'.<br /><br /><i>An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32436549-climbing-mount-improbable\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</i>",

In his book, Gioia more fully addressed the question: Is there a place for poetry to be part of modern American mainstream culture? Ten years later, the debate is as lively and heated as ever. Graywolf is pleased to re-issue this highly acclaimed collection in a handsome new edition, which includes a new Introduction by distinguished critic and poet, Dana Gioia.",

    "description": "An innovative thinker tackles the controversial question of why we believe in God and how religion shapes our lives and our future.<br /><br />For a growing number of people, there is nothing more important than religion. It is an integral part of their marriage, child rearing, and community. In this daring new book, distinguished philosopher Daniel C. Dennett takes a hard look at this phenomenon and asks why. Where does our devotion to God come from and what purpose does it serve? Is religion a blind evolutionary compulsion or a rational choice? In \"Breaking the Spell,\" Dennett argues that the time has come to shed the light of science on the fundamental questions of faith. In a spirited narrative that ranges widely through history, philosophy, and psychology, Dennett explores how organized religion evolved from folk beliefs and why it is such a potent force today. Deftly and lucidly, he contends that the \"belief in belief\" has fogged any attempt to rationally consider the existence of God and the relationship between divinity and human need.<br /><br />\"Breaking the Spell\" is not an antireligious screed but rather an eyeopening exploration of the role that belief plays in our lives, our interactions, and our country. With the gulf between rationalists and adherents of \"intelligent design\" widening daily, Dennett has written a timely and provocative book that will be read and passionately debated by believers and nonbelievers alike.",

The twenty-six-year-old Prince Myshkin, following a stay of several years in a Swiss sanatorium, returns to Russia to collect an inheritance and \u201cbe among people.\u201d Even before he reaches home he meets the dark Rogozhin, a rich merchant\u2019s son whose obsession with the beautiful Nastasya Filippovna eventually draws all three of them into a tragic denouement. In Petersburg the prince finds himself a stranger in a society obsessed with money, power, and manipulation. Scandal escalates to murder as Dostoevsky traces the surprising effect of this \u201cpositively beautiful man\u201d on the people around him, leading to a final scene that is one of the most powerful in all of world literature.",

    "description": "<b>Peter Hennessy's <i>The Secret State: Preparing for the Worst 1945-2010 </i>is the story of secret government plans for combatting attacks on Britain, from the Cold War to modern counter-terrorism.</b><br /><br />Now completely revised and updated, Peter Hennessy's acclaimed account of the secret state includes material from a host of recently declassified documents, to give an up-to-date picture of Whitehall's efforts to defend the safety of the realm.<br /><br />What were the secret plans for Britain if World War Three had erupted and 'breakdown' had occurred? When would the Queen have been informed and where would she have gone? How does the contingency planning for a national emergency work today? By what procedures would the Prime Minister authorise a nuclear strike and how would those orders be carried out? This book now gives the most detailed and authoritative answers to all these questions.<br /><br />'Riveting, path-breaking and wonderfully readable' <br />\u00a0\u00a0Christopher Andrew, <i>The Times</i><br /><br />'Effective and vivid ... One of the fascinations of this book is the bureaucratic aridity to which Whitehall reduced concepts of bloodcurdling awfulness' <br />\u00a0\u00a0Philip Ziegler, <i>Daily Telegraph</i><br /><br />'An insider's insider, if ever there was one' <br />\u00a0\u00a0Anthony Howard, <i>New Statesman</i><br /><br />'One of those rare books that reflects credit not only on the author but on its subjects too' <br />\u00a0\u00a0John Crace, <i>Guardian</i><br /><br /><b>Peter Hennessy </b>is Attlee Professor of History at Queen Mary College, London, and the Director of the Mile End Institute of Contemporary British Government, Intelligence and Society. He is the author of <i>Never Again: Britain 1945-51 </i>(winner of the NCR and Duff Cooper Prizes); the bestselling <i>The Prime Minister</i> and The <i>Secret State.</i>",

The illegitimate son of a dissipated landowner, he is torn between his desire to expose his father\u2019s wrongdoing and the desire to win his love. He travels to St. Petersburg to confront the father he barely knows, inspired by an inchoate dream of communion and armed with a mysterious document that he believes gives him power over others. This new English version by the most acclaimed of Dostoevsky\u2019s translators is a masterpiece of pathos and high comedy.",

    "description": "Widely considered the greatest novel ever written in any language, <b>War and Peace</b> has as its backdrop Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Russia and at its heart three of the most memorable characters in literature: Pierre Bezukhov, a quixotic young man in search of spiritual joy; Prince Andrey Bolkonsky, a cynical intellectual transformed by the suffering of war; and the bewitching and impulsive Natasha Rostov, daughter of a count. As they seek fulfillment, fall in love, make mistakes, and become scarred by battle in different ways, these characters and their stories interweave with those of a huge cast, from aristocrats to peasants, from soldiers to Napoleon himself.<br /><br />In this first English translation in more than forty years, Anthony Briggs faithfully reveals Tolstoy\u2019s art in stirring prose, clearing up ambiguities that have plagued many modern translations. This volume also includes an afterword by eminent historian Orlando Figes, a list of characters, descriptions of the three main battles, chapter summaries, and notes. Both epic and intimate, a compassionate portrait of humanity and an engrossing read, this is the <b>War and Peace</b> of choice for a whole new generation.",

Materialism, pressure to achieve, perfectionism, and disconnection are combining to create a perfect storm that is devastating children of privilege and their parents alike.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this eye-opening, provocative, and essential book, clinical psychologist Madeline Levine explodes one child-rearing myth after another. With empathy and candor, she identifies toxic cultural influences and well-intentioned, but misguided, parenting practices that are detrimental to a child's healthy self-development. Her thoughtful, practical advice provides solutions that will enable parents to help their emotionally troubled \"star\" child cultivate an authentic sense of self.",

    "description": "In spite of the double burden of racial and gender discrimination, African-American women have developed a rich intellectual tradition that is not widely known. In <strong></strong><strong>\n  <em>Black Feminist Thought, </em>\n</strong><strong></strong> Patricia Hill Collins explores the words and ideas of Black feminist intellectuals as well as those African-American women outside academe. She provides an interpretive framework for the work of such prominent Black feminist thinkers as Angela Davis, bell hooks, Alice Walker, and Audre Lorde. The result is a superbly crafted book that provides the first synthetic overview of Black feminist thought.",

    "description": "Jos\u00e9 Saramago is a master at pacing. Readers unfamiliar with the work of this Portuguese Nobel Prize winner would do well to begin with The Cave, a novel of ideas, shaded with suspense. Spare and pensive, The Cave follows the fortunes of an aging potter, Cipriano Algor, beginning with his weekly delivery of plates to the Center, a high-walled, windowless shopping complex, residential community, and nerve center that dominates the region. What sells at the Center will sell everywhere else, and what the Center rejects can barely be given away in the surrounding towns and villages. The news for Cipriano that morning isn't good. Half of his regular pottery shipment is rejected, and he is told that the consumers now prefer plastic tableware. Over the next week, he and his grown daughter Marta grieve for their lost craft, but they gradually open their eyes to the strange bounty of their new condition: a stray dog adopts them, and a lovely widow enters Cipriano's life. When they are invited to live at the Center, it seems ungracious to refuse, but there are strange developments under the complex and a troubling increase in security, and Cipriano changes all their fates by deciding to investigate. In Saramago's able hands, what might have become a dry social allegory is a delicately elaborated story of individualism and unexpected love. --Regina Marler.",

Although they could never marry, their young passion grows into a love that sustains them through war, personal tragedy, and the dangerous heights of political triumph. </p><p> Anne Easter Smith's impeccable research provides the backbone of an engrossing and vibrant debut from a major new historical novelist.</p>",

    "description": "From Brittany's fog-shrouded forests to the elegant dark heart of Paris's royal court, one woman must challenge a country's destiny-and her own dangerous fate.<br /><br />France, 1585. She is the youngest and most powerful of the \"Sisters of Faire Isle,\" women known far and wide for their extraordinary mystical abilities. Skilled in healing and able to forecast the future of those around her, Miri Cheney has returned to her ancestral home to take refuge from a land devastated by civil war-and to grieve for her family, driven to exile. But she cannot hide from the formidable new power threatening to seize control of France from the dread \"Dark Queen,\" Catherine de Medici-a diabolical woman known only as the Silver Rose. Miri has no choice but to turn to the one man she distrusts as much as she desires: Simon Aristide, the charismatic witch-finder who is now himself the hunted, and who has reluctantly made an unholy pact with Catherine. Miri must defy throne and family to save all that she loves most-and command a future greater than she could ever imagine.<br /><br />Vibrant with stunning historical detail, alive with characters as richly passionate as they are compelling, The Silver Rose is a sweeping, exquisitely wrought tale from a mesmerizing storyteller.",

But this is a time when women of ability are deemed sorceresses, when Renaissance France is torn by ruthless political intrigues, and all are held in thrall to the sinister ambitions of Queen Catherine de Medici. Then a wounded stranger arrives on Faire Isle, bearing a secret the Dark Queen will do everything in her power to possess. The only person Ariane can turn to is the comte de Renard, a nobleman with fiery determination and a past as mysterious as his own unusual gifts.<br /><br />Riveting, vibrant, and breathtaking, The Dark Queen follows Ariane and Renard as they risk everything to prevent the fulfillment of a dreadful prophecy even if they must tempt fate and their own passions.",

She is carving out a life for herself and her daughters despite the hostility and greed of her in-laws. But when Gregory is captured in France and held for ransom, Margaret knows she must take action\u2014her in-laws are too tight with money to be of any use\u2014so she teams up with her old friends Mother Hilde, the herbalist, and Brother Malachi, an alchemist on a quest for the secret of changing base metals into gold. Together, the trio plan to rescue Gregory and bring him back to London, where he and Margaret can start a new life away from his meddling family. And thus begins a wild romp across fourteenth-century Europe. Murderous noblemen, scheming ladies, truculent ghosts, and a steady stream of challenges plague the journey. Margaret will need not only her special gift of healing, her quick mind, and her independent spirit but the loyalty of her friends and the love of her new husband to carry them all safely home.",

    "description": "The bestselling novel that introduces Margaret of Ashbury and launches a trilogy featuring this irrepressible woman.<br /><br />Margaret of Ashbury wants to write her life story. However, like most women in fourteenth-century England, she is illiterate. Three clerics contemptuously decline to be Margaret\u2019s scribe, and only the threat of starvation persuades Brother Gregory, a Carthusian friar with a mysterious past, to take on the task. As she narrates her life, we discover a woman of startling resourcefulness. Married off at the age of fourteen to a merchant reputed to be the Devil himself, Margaret was left for dead during the Black Plague. Incredibly, she survived, was apprenticed to an herbalist, and became a midwife. But most astonishing of all, Margaret has experienced a Mystic Union\u2014a Vision of Light that endows her with the miraculous gift of healing. Because of this ability, Margaret has become suddenly different\u2014to her tradition-bound parents, to the bishop\u2019s court that tries her for heresy, and ultimately to the man who falls in love with her.",

    "description": "Fans of Antonia Fraser and Margaret George will love this witty, intelligent page-turner from Judith Merkle Riley. The year is 1556 and the setting is Paris -- capital city to a country on the brink of civil war. Catherine de Medici is queen, and her astrologer, the prophet Nostradamus, has divined the secret evil of the Undying Head of Menander, the Master of All Desires. The Queen wants to use Menander to get rid of the king's mistress, and a spirited young poet named Sibille Artaud de la Roque is tempted by Menander to obtain all her desires. But only Nostradamus knows that evil befalls all who wish upon this accursed object. Can he stop these determined women before they unwittingly destroy the entire kingdom of France?",

    "description": "The book opens in Tudor England, where Henry VIII and his Machiavellian counselor Cardinal Wolsey are scheming to put an English heir on the French throne. They are arranging to marry Henry's pretty, frivolous younger sister, Mary, to the aging king of France, and they are succeeding thanks in no small measure to a breathtaking miniature of Mary that has been delivered secretly into the king's hands. Everyone wants to know the identity of the painter who created this small miracle, and speculation is rampant. Because women are not allowed in the painters' guild, no one suspects that the artist is a woman, Susanna Dallet, who has been bitterly disappointed by her cad of a husband, who left her widowed and penniless with only her nearly divine talent for portrait painting to sustain herself. Susanna catches the eye and not-quite-benign protection of the manipulative, scheming, brilliant Wolsey - who is utterly captivated by her wit, her independence, and her uncanny gift for capturing character with the delicate strokes of her tiny brush. Placed in the entourage of the princess-bride as she travels stormy seas to the royal wedding, Susanna unknowingly carries with her to France the key to a secret that will embroil her in the diabolical plots swirling through the French court. But high in the rigging of the princess's silk-bannered ship sits the angel of art, who not only snatches Susanna from danger but rewards her courage and feisty resourcefulness with the love of an intelligent - and devastatingly attractive - hero.",

    "description": "The final adventure in the beloved and bestselling Margaret of Ashbury trilogy, which began with <i>A Vision of Light</i> and <i>In Pursuit of the Green Lion</i>.<br /><br />Margaret of Ashbury is ready to settle down; the medieval healer is looking forward to an uneventful life in the country. And, indeed, life with her true love and a brood of rambunctious children is nearly perfect\u2014except for her husband Gregory\u2019s ever-meddling family. Finding himself deep in debt once again, Gregory\u2019s father has plotted to sell Margaret\u2019s daughter off in marriage to save his woodlands from a greedy abbot. In a panic, Margaret turns to her old friend Brother Malachi to help save her daughter by whatever means necessary. The tension within the feuding family rouses an ancient being that dwells in a spring at the center of the disputed woodland. The watery creature has its own plans, and its eye is on Margaret\u2019s infant son.<br /><br />Favorite characters return, the stakes are high, and the air is thick with intrigue and danger. Written with the historical accuracy, supernatural plot twists, and humor that Riley\u2019s readers have grown to love, <b>The Water Devil</b> is a high-spirited adventure that brings Margaret\u2019s odyssey to a satisfying conclusion.",

Covered by F-14 fighters, accompanied by security men, the planes carry warriors, pacifists, lovers, enemies, dignitaries -- and a bomb planted by a terrorist mastermind. Suddenly they're forced to crash-land at an ancient desert site. Here, with only a handful of weapons, the men and women of the peace mission must make a desperate stand against an army of crack Palestinian commandos -- while the Israeli authorities desperately attempt a rescue mission. In a land of blood and tears, in a windswept place called Babylon, it will be a battle of bullets and courage, and a war to the last death.",

Which means Gerti - his wife and property. Gerti is not asked how she feels about the use Hermann puts her to. She is a receptacle into which Hermann pours his juices, nastily, briefly, brutally. The long-suffering and battered Gerti thinks she has found her saviour and love in Michael, a student who rescues her after a day of vigorous use by her husband. But Michael is on his way up the Austrian political ladder, and he is, after all, a man.",

At first Talbot is suspected of killing European agents. Then a street-smart ex-cop uncovers a storm of espionage and murder on the streets of New York, while in a Long Island suburb a civic demonstration against the Russian mission masks a desperate duel of nerves and wits.<br /><br />Engineered by Talbot, a shadow world of suspicion and deceit is spilling onto the streets -- leading to a new Soviet weapon and a first-strike war plan threatening the foundations of American government.<br /><br />For the U.S., time is running out. For Talbot, the time is now.",

            "description": "During the bloodthirsty French Revolution, the \"League of the Scarlet Pimpernel\", a secret society of 20 English aristocrats, is engaged in rescuing their French counterparts from the daily executions. Their leader, the mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel, takes his nickname from the drawing of a small red flower with which he signs his messages.
