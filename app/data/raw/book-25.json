Most of the similarities end there. Max and the other kids in Maximum Ride are NOT the same Max and kids featured in those two books. Nor do Frannie and Kit play any part in Maximum Ride. I hope you enjoy the ride anyway.\"",

    "description": "Light Yagami is an ace student with great prospects - and he's bored out of his mind. But all that changes when he finds the Death Note, a notebook dropped by a rogue Shinigami, a death god. Any human whose name is written in the notebook dies, and now Light has vowed to use the power of the Death Note to rid the world of evil. But when criminals begin dropping dead, the authorities send the legendary detective L to track down the killer. With L hot on his heels, will Light lose sight of his noble goal... or his life?<br /><br />Boredom<br />Light tests the boundaries of the Death Note's powers as L and the police begin to close in. Luckily, Light's father is the head of the Japanese National Police Agency and leaves vital information about the case lying around the house. With access to his father's files, Light can keep one step ahead of the authorities. But who is the strange man following him, and how can Light guard against enemies whose names he doesn't know?",

    "description": "In 1942, the logician Kurt Godel and Albert Einstein became close friends; they walked to and from their offices every day, exchanging ideas about science, philosophy, politics, and the lost world of German science. By 1949, Godel had produced a remarkable proof: <i>In any universe described by the Theory of Relativity, time cannot exist</i>. Einstein endorsed this result reluctantly but he could find no way to refute it, since then, neither has anyone else. Yet cosmologists and philosophers alike have proceeded as if this discovery was never made. In <i>A World Without Time</i>, Palle Yourgrau sets out to restore Godel to his rightful place in history, telling the story of two magnificent minds put on the shelf by the scientific fashions of their day, and attempts to rescue the brilliant work they did together.",

    "description": "Skilled in passion, artful in deception, and driven by betrayal, she is the glittering center of the royal court-but the most desired woman of Renaissance France will draw the wrath of a dangerous adversary.<br /><br />Paris, 1575. The consort of some of Europe's most influential men, Gabrielle Cheney is determined to secure her future by winning the heart of Henry, the Huguenot king of Navarre. As his mistress, Gabrielle hopes she might one day become the power behind the French throne. But her plans are jeopardized by Captain Nicolas Remy, a devoted warrior whose love Gabrielle desires-and fears-above all. She will also incur the malevolence of the Dark Queen, Catherine de' Medici, whose spies and witch-hunters are legion, and who will summon the black arts to maintain her authority. With the lives of those she loves in peril, Gabrielle must rebel against her queen to fulfill a glorious destiny she has sacrificed everything to gain.<br /><br />Alive with vivid period detail and characters as vibrant as they are memorable, The Courtesan<i> </i>is a sweeping historical tale of dangerous intrigues, deep treachery, and one woman's unshakable resolve to honor her heart.",

    "description": "From the Pulitzer Prize-winning culture critic for Time magazine comes the tremendously controversial, yet highly persuasive, argument that our devotion to the largely unexamined myth of egalitarianism lies at the heart of the ongoing \"dumbing of America.\"<br /><br />Americans have always stubbornly clung to the myth of egalitarianism, of the supremacy of the individual average man. But here, at long last, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic William A. Henry III takes on, and debunks, some basic, fundamentally ingrained ideas: that everyone is pretty much alike (and should be); that self-fulfillment is more important than objective achievement; that everyone has something significant to contribute; that all cultures offer something equally worthwhile; that a truly just society would automatically produce equal success results across lines of race, class, and gender; and that the common man is almost always right. Henry makes clear, in a book full of vivid examples and unflinching opinions, that while these notions are seductively democratic they are also hopelessly wrong.",

    "description": "The world according to David Ives is a very odd place, and his plays constitute a virtual stress test of the English language -- and of the audience's capacity for disorientation and delight. Ives's characters plunge into black holes called \"Philadelphias,\" where the simplest desires are hilariously thwarted. Chimps named Milton, Swift, and Kafka are locked in a room and made to re-create Hamlet. And a con man peddles courses in a dubious language in which \"hello\" translates as \"velcro\" and \"fraud\" comes out as \"freud.\"<br /><br />At once enchanting and perplexing, incisively intelligent and side-splittingly funny, this original paperback edition of Ives's plays includes \"Sure Thing,\" \"Words, Words, Words,\" \"The Universal Language,\" \"Variations on the Death of Trotsky,\" \"The Philadelphia,\" \"Long Ago and Far Away,\" \"Foreplay, or The Art of the Fugue,\" \"Seven Menus,\" \"Mere Mortals,\" \"English Made Simple,\" \"A Singular Kinda Guy,\" \"Speed-the-Play,\" \"Ancient History,\" and \"Philip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread.\"",

    "description": "A swashbuckling adventure story that reveals for the first time how Diego de la Vega became the masked man we all know so well Born in southern California late in the eighteenth century, Diego de la Vega is a child of two worlds. His father is an aristocratic Spanish military man turned landowner; his mother, a Shoshone warrior. At the age of sixteen, Diego is sent to Spain, a country chafing under the corruption of Napoleonic rule. He soon joins La Justicia, a secret underground resistance movement devoted to helping the powerless and the poor. Between the New World and the Old, the persona of Zorro is formed, a great hero is born, and the legend begins. After many adventures -- duels at dawn, fierce battles with pirates at sea, and impossible rescues -- Diego de la Vega, a.k.a. Zorro, returns to America to reclaim the hacienda on which he was raised and to seek justice for all who cannot fight for it themselves.",

    "description": "From Nora Roberts, the incomparable New York Times bestselling author of Sanctuary and Montana Sky, comes a mesmerizing story of a woman trapped by a dangerous desire and threatened by a murderous secret, one of Nora Roberts's most popular novels. <br />Emma. Beautiful, intelligent, radiantly talented, she lives in a star-studded world of wealth and privilege. But she is about to discover that fame is no protection at all when someone wants you dead.... <br />All she has to do is close her eyes and she remembers the magical day her father came into her life. She was a frightened, lonely toddler, hiding, always hiding, from her mother's wrath, when Brian McAvoy swept in and took her away. She didn't know then that she was his illegitimate daughter or that she had just been rescued by pop music's rising new star. All she knew was that suddenly she felt safe. <br />And there wasn't only Brian...his new wife became Emma's loving stepmother, his band members became her surrogate uncles, and soon Emma even had a new baby brother to care for. Then just when everything seemed perfect, a horrifying event shattered all their lives: a botched kidnapping attempt, shocking the<br />world, traumatizing Emma, leaving her bereft of her newfound happiness. <br />Yet now, after so many years of pain and guilt, of being overprotected and hounded by the press, Emma finally feels as if she's put the tragedy behind her. A determined, self-sufficient young woman, she has carved out a thrilling career, and even dared to fall rapturously in love. But the man who will become her husband isn't all that he seems. And Emma is about to awaken to the chilling knowledge that the darkest secret of all is the one buried inher mind--a secret that someone may kill to keep. <br />With Public Secrets, Nora Roberts has woven an absorbing tale of a woman you can't help but care for, trapped in a terrifying web of suspense that will<br />keep you reading long into the night.",

    "description": "<b>\n  <i>He came to me first in a dream, as a crippled dog angling down a country lane, puzzled by his sudden age, his bum paw, the dry stick clamped between his teeth. I'd been expecting this dream for a very long time, and I woke up moving. . . .<br /></i>\n</b><br />Rita Rosario has a gift, a way with people. She listens to them and really sees them for who they are-warts and all. And sometimes, she even knows how to guide them toward a new beginning. Women, even men, come to Rita's beauty shop for perms, town gossip, and the makeovers of their very lives.<br /><br />John Reed first appears to Rita in one of her dreams. When they meet at a town gathering a few days later, she immediately offers him a haircut, and her heart. As they share their stories, Rita senses she can help John fill a void by reconnecting him to his only family-a young niece he nearly lost in a heartbreaking tragedy. While inspiring John on a journey out of loneliness and into reconciliation, Rita begins to come to terms with events in her past . . . and discovers things about herself she never realized, including her own intimate role in John's unfolding story.",

Manette Ansay re-creates a stifling world of guilty and pain, and the tormented souls who inhabit it. It is 1972 when circumstance carries Ellen Grier and her family back to Holly's Field, Wisconsin. Dutifully accompanying her newly unemployed husband, Ellen has brought her two children into the home of her in-laws on Vinegar Hill -- a loveless house suffused with the settling dust of bitterness and routine -- where calculated cruelty is a way of life preserved and perpetuated in the service of a rigid, exacting and angry God. Behind a facade of false piety, there are sins and secrets in this place that could crush a vibrant young woman's passionate spirit. And here Ellen must find the straight to endure, change, and grow in the all-pervading darkness that threatens to destroy everything she is and everyone she loves.",

    "description": "Published in rapid succession in the middle 1930s, <i>Journey to the End of the Night</i> and <i>Death on the Installment Plan</i> shocked European literature and world consciousness. Nominally fiction but more rightly called \"creative confessions,\" they told of the author's childhood in excoriating Paris slums, of service in the mud wastes of World War I and African jungles. Mixing unmitigated despair with Gargantuan comedy, they also created a new style, in which invective and obscenity were laced with phrases of unforgettable poetry. C\u00e9line's influence revolutionized the contemporary approach to fiction. Under a cloud for a period, his work is now acknowledged as the forerunner of today's \"black comedy.\"<br /><br /><i>Death on the Installment Plan</i> is the story of young Ferdinand's first 18 years. His life is one of hatred, of the grinding struggle of small shopkeepers to survive, of childhood sensations and fantasies \u2013 lusty, scatological, violent, but also poetic. There is a running battle with his ineffectual insurance clerk of a father, with his mother, who lives and whines around the junkshop she runs for the boys benefit; there is also the superbly funny Meanwell College in England, where the boy went briefly, a Dickensian, nightmare institution. Always there is humiliation, failure, and boredom, at least until he teams up with the \"scientist\" des Pereires. This inventor, con-man, incorrigible optimist \u2013 whose last project is to grow enormous potatoes by electricity \u2013 rescues him, if only temporarily; for the reader he is one of the most lovable charlatans in French literature.",

    "description": "In seventeenth-century Delft, there's a strict social order<b>\u2014</b>rich and poor, Catholic and Protestant, master and servant<b>\u2014</b>and all know their place. When Griet becomes a maid in the household of the painter Johannes Vermeer, she thinks she knows her role: housework, laundry, and the care of his six children. She even feels able to handle his shrewd mother-in-law; his restless, sensual wife; and their jealous servant. What no one expects is that Griet's quiet manner, quick perceptions, and fascination with her master's paintings will draw her inexorably into his world. Their growing intimacy sparks whispers; and when Vermeer paints her wearing his wife's pearl earrings, the gossip escalates into a full-blown scandal that irrevocably changes Griet's life.<br /><br />Written with the precision and focus of an Old Master painting, <b>Girl With a Pearl Earring</b> is a vivid portrait of colorful seventeenth-century Delft, as well as the hauntingly poignant story of one young girl's rite of passage.",

    "description": "<i>The Four Insights</i> are the wisdom teachings that have been protected by secret societies of Earthkeepers, the medicine men and women of the Americas. The Insights state that all creation\u2014humans, whales, and even stars\u2014is made from light manifest through the power of intention. The Earthkeepers mastered the Insights, and used them to heal disease, eliminate emotional suffering, and even grow new bodies that age and heal differently.<br /><br /><br />Mastery of the Insights allows you to reinform your DNA and participate consciously in your biological, emotional, and spiritual evolution. According to the prophecies of the Maya, Hopi, and Inka Earthkeepers, we\u2019re at a turning point in human history, when a new species of human will give birth to itself. We\u2019re going to take a quantum leap into what we\u2019re becoming and will no longer be Homo sapiens but Homo luminouos. The Four Insights reveal ancient technologies we can practice for becoming beings of light with the ability to perceive the energy and vibration that make up the physical universe at a much higher level.",

This is a fascinating work that will intrigue readers from all walks of life!",

    "description": "Inspired by a traditional ballad, Juniper, Gentian, and Rosemary is the tale of a mysterious young man and three ordinary young girls, of ancient magic and the modern world. <br />Three sisters live comfortably with their parents: Juniper, 16, who likes cooking and computer chats; Gentian, 13, who likes plays and astronomy; Rosemary, 11, who likes Girl Scouts. Enter Dominic, handsome as the night, quoting poetry, telling riddles, and asking help for a complex and fascinating science project. <br />Gentian isn't interested at first--she has her own life. But gradually her life, and her time, belong more and more to Dominic and his project, and her father begins to fear that the lad may be more than a charmer. . . . <br />",

    "description": "<b>From the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Mama's Last Hug</i> and <i>Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?</i>, a provocative argument that apes have created their own distinctive culture</b><br /><br />In <i>The Ape and the Sushi Master</i>, eminent primatologist Frans de Waal corrects our arrogant assumption that humans are the only creatures to have made the leap from the natural to the cultural domain. The book's title derives from an analogy de Waal draws between the way behavior is transmitted in ape society and the way sushi-making skills are passed down from sushi master to apprentice. Like the apprentice, young apes watch their group mates at close range, absorbing the methods and lessons of each of their elders' actions. Responses long thought to be instinctive are actually learned behavior, de Waal argues, and constitute ape culture. A delightful mix of intriguing anecdote, rigorous clinical study, adventurous field work, and fascinating speculation, <i>The Ape and the Sushi Master</i> shows that apes are not human caricatures but members of our extended family with their own resourcefulness and dignity.<br /><br />",

    "description": "Development, it is generally assumed, is good and necessary, and in its name the West has intervened, implementing all manner of projects in the impoverished regions of the world. When these projects fail, as they do with astonishing regularity, they nonetheless produce a host of regular and unacknowledged effects, including the expansion of bureaucratic state power and the translation of the political realities of poverty and powerlessness into \"technical\" problems awaiting solution by \"development\" agencies and experts. It is the political intelligibility of these effects, along with the process that produces them, that this book seeks to illuminate through a detailed case study of the workings of the \"development\" industry in one country, Lesotho, and in one \"development\" project. Using an anthropological approach grounded in the work of Foucault, James Ferguson analyzes the institutional framework within which such projects are crafted and the nature of \"development discourse,\" revealing how it is that, despite all the \"expertise\" that goes into formulating development projects, they nonetheless often demonstrate a startling ignorance of the historical and political realities of the locale they are intended to help. In a close examination of the attempted implementation of the Thaba-Tseka project in Lesotho, Ferguson shows how such a misguided approach plays out, how, in fact, the \"development\" apparatus in Lesotho acts as an \"anti-politics machine,\" everywhere whisking political realities out of sight and all the while performing, almost unnoticed, its own pre-eminently political operation of strengthening the state presence in the local region.James Ferguson is an associate professor of anthropology at the University of California at Irvine.",

It doesn\u2019t take much--just hearing of someone else\u2019s accomplishments, being criticized, getting into an argument, making a mistake at work--to make us feel that we are not okay. Beginning to understand how our lives have become ensnared in this trance of unworthiness is our first step toward reconnecting with who we really are and what it means to live fully. <br /></i>--<i>from</i> <b>Radical Acceptance<br /><br />Radical Acceptance<br /><br /></b>\u201cBelieving that something is wrong with us is a deep and tenacious suffering,\u201d says Tara Brach at the start of this illuminating book. This suffering emerges in crippling self-judgments and conflicts in our relationships, in addictions and perfectionism, in loneliness and overwork--all the forces that keep our lives constricted and unfulfilled. Radical Acceptance offers a path to freedom, including the day-to-day practical guidance developed over Dr. Brach\u2019s twenty years of work with therapy clients and Buddhist students.<br /><br />Writing with great warmth and clarity, Tara Brach brings her teachings alive through personal stories and case histories, fresh interpretations of Buddhist tales, and guided meditations. Step by step, she leads us to trust our innate goodness, showing how we can develop the balance of clear-sightedness and compassion that is the essence of <b>Radical Acceptance</b>. <b>Radical Acceptance</b> does not mean self-indulgence or passivity. Instead it empowers genuine change: healing fear and shame and helping to build loving, authentic relationships. When we stop being at war with ourselves, we are free to live fully every precious moment of our lives.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

It is a masterpiece from one of the world's most innovative writers.",

A curse that began with his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather and has since followed generations of Yelnatses. Now Stanley has been unjustly sent to a boys\u2019 detention center, Camp Green Lake, where the boys build character by spending all day, every day digging holes exactly five feet wide and five feet deep. There is no lake at Camp Green Lake. But there are an awful lot of holes.<br /><br />It doesn\u2019t take long for Stanley to realize there\u2019s more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake. The boys are digging holes because the warden is looking for something. But what could be buried under a dried-up lake? Stanley tries to dig up the truth in this inventive and darkly humorous tale of crime and punishment\u2014and redemption.",

Even those who know <i>vi</i> often make use of only a small number of its features.<br /><br /><i>Learning the vi Editor</i> is a complete guide to text editing with <i>vi</i>. Topics new to the sixth edition include multiscreen editing and coverage of four <i>vi</i>clones: <i>vim</i>, <i>elvis</i>, <i>nvi</i>, and <i>vile</i> and their enhancements to <i>vi</i>, such as multi-window editing, GUI interfaces, extended regular expressions, and enhancements for programmers. A new appendix describes <i>vi</i>'s place in the Unix and Internet cultures.<br /><br />Quickly learn the basics of editing, cursor movement, and global search and replacement. Then take advantage of the more subtle power of <i>vi</i>. Extend your editing skills by learning to use <i>ex</i>, a powerful line editor, from within <i>vi</i>. For easy reference, the sixth edition also includes a command summary at the end of each appropriate chapter.<br /><br />Topics covered include:<br /><br /><br />Basic editing Moving around in a hurry Beyond the basics Greater power with <i>ex</i> Global search and replacement Customizing <i>vi</i> and <i>ex</i> Command shortcuts Introduction to the <i>vi</i> clones' extensions The <i>nvi</i>, <i>elvis</i>, <i>vim</i>, and <i>vile</i> editors Quick reference to <i>vi</i> and <i>ex</i> commands<br /><i>vi</i> and the Internet",

    "description": "Apache is far and away the most widely used web server platform in the world. This versatile server runs more than half of the world's existing web sites. Apache is both free and rock-solid, running more than 21 million web sites ranging from huge e-commerce operations to corporate intranets and smaller hobby sites.<br /><br />With this new third edition of <i>Apache: The Definitive Guide</i>, web administrators new to Apache will come up to speed quickly, and experienced administrators will find the logically organized, concise reference sections indispensable, and system programmers interested in customizing their servers will rely on the chapters on the API and Apache modules.<br /><br />Updated to cover the changes in Apache's latest release, 2.0, as well as Apache 1.3, this useful guide discusses how to obtain, set up, secure, modify, and troubleshoot the Apache software on both Unix and Windows systems. Dozens of clearly written examples provide the answers to the real-world issues that Apache administrators face everyday. In addition to covering the installation and configuration of mod_perl and Tomcat, the book examines PHP, Cocoon, and other new technologies that are associated with the Apache web server. Additional coverage of security and the Apache 2.0 API make <i>Apache: The Definitive Guide</i>, Third Edition essential documentation for the world's most popular web server.",

Ballard's voice and vision have long served as a font of inspiration for today's cyber-punks, the authors and futurist who brought the information age into the mainstream.<br /></div>",

Now, in the compelling sequel, Jean Sasson and Princess Sultana turn the spotlight on Sultana's two teenage daughters, Maha and Amani. <br /><br />As second-generation members of the royal family who have benefited from Saudi oil wealth, Maha and Amani are surrounded by untold opulence and luxury from the day they were born. And yet, they are stifled by the unbearably restrictive lifestyle imposed on them, driving them to desperate measures. <br /><br />Throughout, Sultana and Sasson never tire of their quest to expose the injustices which society levels against women. Princess Sultana once more strikes a chord among all women who are lucky enough to have the freedom to speak out for themselves.",

    "description": "The Bride and the Bachelors, published here in a revised and expanded edition, is one of the essential art books of the last half-century. Its witty and readable accounts of the lives and work of Marcel Duchamp, John Cage, Jean Tinguely, Robert Rauschenberg, and Merce Cunningham reveal the ways in which they influenced one another, and opened the way to new perspectives on the nature and purpose of art. The addition of Tomkins's more recent profile of Jasper Johns, as he reflects on his six-decade career, completes the cycle and provides fresh insights on the ever-shifting relationships between art and contemporary life. This edition also includes a new introduction by the author.",

    "description": "Ever wondered who you are? Who you <i>really</i> are? This collection of writings and reflections by some of today's most notable thinkers is designed to enliven this most central, and most baffling, question in the philosophy of mind. In some ways, the questions posed and bantered about in this book are at the heart of all philosophical reasoning. They are the ultimate questions about the self. <i>The Mind's I</i> contains an astonishing variety of approaches to answering the question, \"Who am I?\" Between the covers of this book one encounters the literary erudition of Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges alongside the analytic rigor of John Searle. There are sophisticated metaphorical pieces (such as \"The Princess Ineffabelle\" by Polish philosopher and writer Stanislaw Lem), intriguing dialogues (like Raymond Smullyan's \"Is God a Taoist?\"), and serious but engaging philosophical essays from a host of thinkers (see Thomas Nagel's \"What Is It Like to Be a Bat?\"). <p> Editors Hofstadter and Dennett--leading lights in the study of cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and the philosophy of mind--follow each selection with a short reflection designed to elaborate on their main themes. <i>The Mind's I</i> admirably broadens their fields to a more general audience. The book's essays are grouped into six categories, each successively raising the philosophical stakes by introducing new levels of complexity. Ultimately, one confronts some of the thorniest questions in modern philosophy here, such as the nature of free will, our place in the metaphysical world, and the possibility of genuine artificial intelligence. The book closes with a playful and perplexing piece by Robert Nozick, an adequate summation to <i>The Mind's I</i>. He writes, \"Perhaps God has not decided yet whether he has created, in this world, a fictional world or a real one.... Which decision do you hope for?\" <i>--Eric de Place</i></p>",

As with every art, love demands practice and concentration, as well as genuine insight and understanding.<br /><br />In his classic work, <i>The Art of Loving</i>, renowned psychoanalyst and social philosopher Erich Fromm explores love in all its aspects\u2014not only romantic love, steeped in false conceptions and lofty expectations, but also brotherly love, erotic love, self-love, the love of God, and the love of parents for their children.",

    "description": "One of the greatest philosophers of the nineteenth century, Schopenhauer believed that human action is determined not by reason but by 'will' - the blind and irrational desire for physical existence. This selection of his writings on religion, ethics, politics, women and many other themes is taken from Schopenhauer's last work, <i>Parerga and Paralipomena</i>, which he published in 1851. He depicts humanity as locked in a struggle beyond good and evil, each individual absolutely free within a Godless world in which art, morality and self-awareness are our only salvation. This innovative and pessimistic view proved powerfully influential upon philosophy and art, affecting the work of Nietzsche and Wittgenstein among others.",

    "description": "\"On Television\" exposes the invisible mechanisms of manipulation and censorship that determine what appears on the small screen. Bourdieu shows how the ratings game has transformed journalism -- and hence politics -- and even such seemingly removed fields as law, science, art, and philosophy. Bourdieu had long been concerned with the role of television in cultural and political life when he bypassed the political and commercial control of the television networks and addressed his country's viewers from the television station of the College de France. \"On Television,\" which expands on that lecture, not only describes the limiting and distorting effect of television on journalism and the world of ideas, but offers the blueprint for a counterattack.",

    "description": "Kiran Desai's first novel, <i>Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard</i>, was published to unanimous acclaim in over twenty-two countries. Now Desai takes us to the northeastern Himalayas where a rising insurgency challenges the old way of life. In a crumbling, isolated house at the foot of Mount Kanchenjunga lives an embittered old judge who wants to retire in peace when his orphaned granddaughter Sai arrives on his doorstep. The judge's chatty cook watches over her, but his thoughts are mostly with his son, Biju, hopscotching from one New York restaurant job to another, trying to stay a step ahead of the INS, forced to consider his country's place in the world. When a Nepalese insurgency in the mountains threatens Sai's new-sprung romance with her handsome Nepali tutor and causes their lives to descend into chaos, they, too, are forced to confront their colliding interests. The nation fights itself. The cook witnesses the hierarchy being overturned and discarded. The judge must revisit his past, his own role in this grasping world of conflicting desires-every moment holding out the possibility for hope or betrayal. A novel of depth and emotion, Desai's second, long-awaited novel fulfills the grand promise established by her first.",

    "description": "<b>A landmark American drama that inspired a classic film and a Broadway revival\u2014featuring an introduction by David Mamet<br /></b><br />A blistering character study and an examination of the American melting pot and the judicial system that keeps it in check,\u00a0<i>Twelve Angry Men</i>\u00a0holds at its core a deeply patriotic faith in the U.S. legal system. The play centers on Juror Eight, who is at first the sole holdout in an 11-1 guilty vote. Eight sets his sights not on proving the other jurors wrong but rather on getting them to look at the situation in a clear-eyed way not affected by their personal prejudices or biases. Reginald Rose deliberately and carefully peels away the layers of artifice from the men and allows a fuller picture to form of them\u2014and of America, at its best and worst.<br /> \u00a0<br /> After the critically acclaimed teleplay aired in 1954, this landmark American drama went on to become a cinematic masterpiece in 1957 starring Henry Fonda, for which Rose wrote the adaptation. More recently, <i>Twelve Angry Men </i>had a successful, and award-winning, run on Broadway.<br /><br />For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700\u00a0titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the\u00a0series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date\u00a0translations by award-winning translators.",

    "description": "The 1990s seems to be the decade of revelation. What used to be private is becoming increasingly public. All is aired on talk shows whose guests are no longer celebrities hawking their latest film, book, or album, but ordinary citizens selling their personal traumas. Mothers Who Sleep with Their Daughters' Boyfriends; Men Who Wear Their Girlfriends' Clothes; People Whose Families Have Been Murdered Before Their Eyes - no subject is too salacious or too shameful for public consumption. <br />And now here comes a true story about A Woman Who Slept with Her Father - prime fodder for the TV talk show feeding frenzy. Certainly it would be easy to lump <i>Kathryn Harrison's</i> new memoir, <i>The Kiss</i> into this same category of titillating topics, but that would be a mistake. <br />There is nothing remotely titillating about Harrison's book; instead, it reads like a slow descent into hell - one that compels and repels in almost equal measure at times. Harrison, who did not really meet her father until she was 20, takes the reader on a difficult journey into her loveless childhood, her bouts with anorexia and bulimia, and, eventually, the incestuous 4-year affair with her father. <br />Her prose is deceptively simple; her choice of present tense to describe events that occurred many years ago forces an immediacy - almost a complicity - upon the reader that heightens both revulsion and compassion. <br /><i>The Kiss</i> is not for everybody. Some readers will be outraged by its subject matter; others will find it just too painful to read. <br />But for those who make it through, this harrowing tale promises the reward of a life reclaimed and a tragedy transcended.",

    "description": "Ann Rogers appears to be a happily married, successful young woman. A talented photographer, she creates happy memories for others, videotaping weddings, splicing together scenes of smiling faces, editing out awkward moments. But she cannot edit her own memories so easily; images of a childhood spent as her father's model and muse, the subject of his celebrated series of controversial photographs. To cope, Ann slips into a secret life of shame and vice. But when the Museum of Modern Art announces a retrospective of her father's shocking portraits, Ann finds herself teetering on the edge of self-destruction, desperately trying to escape the psychological maelstrom that threatens to consume her.",

    "description": "In her first trial by fire, Cordelia Naismith captained a throwaway ship of the Betan Expeditionary Force on a mission to destroy an enemy armada. Discovering deception within deception, treachery within treachery, she was forced into a separate peace with her chief opponent, Lord Aral Vorkosigan - he who was called \"The Butcher of Komarr\" - and would consequently become an outcast on her own planet and the Lady Vorkosigan on his. <br /><br />Sick of combat and betrayal, she was ready to settle down to a quiet life, interrupted only by the occasional ceremonial appearances required of the Lady Vorkosigan. But when the Emperor died, Aral suddenly became guardian of the infant heir to the imperial throne of Barrayar - and the target of high-tech assassins in a dynastic civil war that was reminiscent of earth's Middle Ages, but fought with up-to-the minute biowar technology. Neither Aral nor Cordelia guessed the part that their cell-damaged unborn son would play in Barrayar's bloody legacy. This edition includes an author's afterword, and a chronology of the events in the Vorkosigan Saga series. Cover art by Gary Ruddell.",

    "description": "Why have we come to revere Francis of Assisi, a simple thirteenth-century Italian merchant's son, as a saint? Why has his appeal endured over eight hundred years and even expanded beyond the world of Catholicism to make him one of the most beloved religious figures of all time? This penetrating meditation on Francis's life gently but sure-handedly cuts through every pious legend to uncover what is timeless and universally true about him. Christian Bobin's unexpected and thoroughly original work presents a compelling image of a man whose power is found in humility, whose radical casting aside of wealth, honor, and even personal identity is inseparable from his overwhelming intimacy with God. Poetic, luminous, utterly hypnotic, <i>The Very Lowly </i> is a unique modern variation on the saint's life that will entrance everyone, whether \"religious\" or\u2014almost especially\u2014not.",

Brin's tales are set in a future universe in which no species can reach sentience without being \"uplifted\" by a patron race. But the greatest mystery of all remains unsolved: who uplifted humankind?<br /><br />The Terran exploration vessel <i>Streaker</i> has crashed in the uncharted water world of Kithrup, bearing one of the most important discoveries in galactic history. Below, a handful of her human and dolphin crew battles armed rebellion and a hostile planet to safeguard her secret--the fate of the Progenitors, the fabled First Race who seeded wisdom throughout the stars.",

But he's about to come face-to-face with proof that God does indeed exist. Merging with a bizarre spiritual force called Genesis, Jesse now possesses the power of \"the Word,\" an ability to make people do whatever he utters. He begins a violent and riotous journey across the country in search of answers from the elusive deity.",

    "description": "Compelling evidence that the Chinese were the first great maritime explorers -- not the Europeans. Rewrite the history books!<br /><br />In 1421, the largest fleet the world had ever seen sailed from its base in China. The ships, huge junks nearly 500 feet long and built from the finest teak, were under the command of Emperor Zhu Di\u2019s loyal eunuch admirals. Their mission was to proceed all the way to the end of the earth to collect tribute from the barbarians beyond the seas and unite the whole world in Confucian harmony. Their journey would last over two years and circle the globe.<br /><br />When they returned, Zhu Di had lost power and China was beginning its long, self-imposed isolation from the world. The great ships rotted and the records of their journeys were destroyed. Lost was the knowledge that Chinese ships had reached America 70 years before Columbus and circumnavigated the globe a century before Magellan. They had also discovered Antarctica, reached Australia 350 years before Cook, and solved the problem of longitude 300 years before the Europeans.<br /><br />In this fascinating historical detective story, Gavin Menzies shares the remarkable account of his discoveries and the incontrovertible evidence supporting them.",

The series first appeared in French in Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me, a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le XXe Si\u00e8cle  on 10 January 1929. The success of the series saw the serialised strips collected into a series of twenty-four albums, spun into a successful magazine and adapted for film, radio, television and theatre. \n    \n    Set during a largely realistic 20th century, the hero of the series is <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/characters/1770-tintin\">Tintin</a>, a young Belgian reporter. He is aided in his adventures from the beginning by his faithful fox terrier dog <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/characters/33343-snowy\">Snowy</a> (Milou in French). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash, cynical and grumpy <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/characters/3080-captain-archibald-haddock\">Captain Haddock</a>, the highly intelligent but hearing-impaired <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/characters/86001-professeur-tournesol\">Professor Calculus</a> (Professeur Tournesol) and other supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/characters/3083-thomson-thompson\">Thomson and Thompson</a> (Dupont et Dupond). Herg\u00e9 himself features in several of the comics as a background character, as do his assistants in some instances.",

But when Rei overpays for a beautiful chest of drawers, she's in for the worst deal of her life. The con man who sold her the Tansu is found dead, and like it or not Rei's opened a pandora's box of mystery, theft, and murder.<br /><br />Only Rei sees the Tansu as the key. It will take a quick wit, fast feet, and above all a Zen Attitude for Rei to discover what a young monk, a judo star, and an ancient scroll have in common, and why her own life hangs in the balance.",

    "description": "Aldous Huxley's lifelong concern with the dichotomy between passion and reason finds its fullest expression both thematically and formally in his masterpiece <i>Point Counter Point</i>. By presenting a vision of life in which diverse aspects of experience are observed simultaneously, Huxley characterizes the symptoms of \"the disease of the modern man\" in the manner of a composer--themes and characters are repeated, altered slightly, and played off one another in a tone that is at once critical and sympathetic.<br /><br />First published in 1928, Huxley's satiric view of intellectual life in the '20s is populated with characters based on such celebrities as D.H. Lawrence, Katherine Mansfield, Nancy Cunard, and John Middleton Murry, as well as Huxley himself.",

At stake were not only the reputations of two historians but the record of history itself.",

    "description": "The three met in the aftermath of San Francisco's devastating 1906 earthquake--the Mandarin Lai Tsin, a runaway American heiress, and a young Englishwoman. Against all odds they made their dreams come true, building one of the world's largest trading companies and most luxurious hotels... They had only each other--and bloody secrets to bury even as they rose to dizzying heights, wary of love yet vulnerable to passion in its most dangerous forms... The Mandarin would pass his multi-billion-dollar empire only to the women in the Lai Tsin dynasty--along with one last devastating truth....<br /><br />Sweeping from the turn of the century through the 1960's, from the Orient to San Francisco and New York, Elizabeth Adler has written a magnificent novel of new wealth and old privilege, family passions and secret shame, of women surviving, triumphant, in the riveting saga of romantic intrigue.",

Alma Winemiller, the sheltered daughter of a minister, secretly harbors a lifelong love for the boy next door, Dr. John Buchanan. Alma seeks a spiritual love with just one man, but the rakish John is focused solely on sexual conquest. Their intense relationship degenerates into a battle for his body and her soul.",

    "description": "Johnson reveals little-known facts about Oates's personal and family history and debunks many of the myths that have arisen about this brilliant, enigmatic woman. Johnson takes readers from Oates's impoverished childhood in upstate New York and the birth of her autistic sister through Oates's studies at Syracuse University, where her talent was immediately recognized, to the full breadth of her astonishingly productive career. His astute examination of Oates's novels, short stories, and plays demonstrates how her art has been informed by her life.",

Her Slightly Significant Other, Will, will be returning from summer stock in September, to pick up where they left off. (Or will he?)</p> <p>But, in the days after Will's departure, Tracey decides it's time for a reality check. Her un-air-conditioned East Village apartment is a dump, her entry-level ad job sucks, her thighs don't seem to be getting any thinner, and Will seems to have dropped off the face of the earth. So, Tracey, with the help of her friends and one very attentive guy, decides to spend her summer reinventing herself . . . and taking a chance on liking the new woman she becomes.</p> <p>A refreshingly honest account of universal female dilemmas, <i>Slightly Single</i> is an engaging story of one young woman's search for happiness.</p>",

Like others in the French Resistance, winemakers mobilized to oppose their occupiers, but the tale of their extraordinary efforts has remained largely unknown-until now. This is the thrilling and harrowing story of the French wine producers who undertook ingenious, daring measures to save their cherished crops and bottles as the Germans closed in on them. <i>Wine and War</i> illuminates a compelling, little-known chapter of history, and stands as a tribute to extraordinary individuals who waged a battle that, in a very real way, saved the spirit of France.",

There he introduces us to Liir, an adolescent boy last seen hiding in the shadows of the castle after Dorothy did in the Witch. Bruised, comatose, and left for dead in a gully, Liir is shattered in spirit as well as in form. But he is tended at the Cloister of Saint Glinda by the silent novice called Candle, who wills him back to life with her musical gifts.<br /><br />What dark force left Liir in this condition? Is he really Elphaba's son? He has her broom and her cape -- but what of her powers? Can he find his supposed half-sister, Nor, last seen in the forbidding prison, Southstairs? Can he fulfill the last wishes of a dying princess? In an Oz that, since the Wizard's departure, is under new and dangerous management, can Liir keep his head down long enough to grow up?<br /><br />For the countless fans who have been dazzled and entranced by Maguire's Oz, <em>Son of a Witch</em> is the rich reward they have awaited so long.",

    "description": "<b>Where Do You Worship? </b><br /><br />Not everyone may frequent the church on the corner, but we each have a place of worship. For some, it\u2019s at the office. For others, before the mirror. Still others, on the basketball court. You were created to worship! So you naturally find a place to do it. But to worship anything less than God robs both Him and us. It\u2019s at the foot of the cross where we reel, trying to comprehend how a holy God could chase us down with kindness and redeem us from an eternity of futile gods. In this newly revised and refreshed edition of the original <i>The Air I Breathe</i>, you\u2019ll find your sense of worship increasing beyond church walls or a Sunday routine. Soon all of life becomes your delighted response to God! <br /><br /><b>Everybody Worships Something </b><br /><br /><b>What captures your time and attention?</b> <br /><br />We are all worshipers\u2026of something. But are we spending our lives and filling our days with what matters most? <br /><br />Newly revised, <i>The Air I Breathe</i> will awaken you to the reality that worship is more than a service on Sunday. It\u2019s every moment reflecting God\u2019s glory and grace. <br /><br />\u201cSome of the most inspiring teaching on worship I\u2019ve ever heard has come from Louie Giglio. This book has inspired me as a worshiper and as a worship leader.\u201d<br /><b>\n  <i><b><i>\u2014</i></b>Matt Redman, Author of The Unquenchable Worshipper and The Heart of Worship <br /></i>\n</b><br />\u201cIt\u2019s about time we had a book from Louie Giglio! Read it, and find out why.\u201d <br /><b>\n  <i><b><i>\u2014</i></b>Beth Moore, Bestselling author, speaker, and founder of Living Proof Ministries <br /></i>\n</b><br />\u201cA message that has sent shock waves through the church.\u201d <br /><b>\n  <i><b><i>\u2014</i></b>Andy Stanley, Senior pastor, North Point Community Church <br /></i>\n</b><br />\u201cDon\u2019t read <i>The Air I Breathe</i> unless you want to reexamine your life to see whom or what you are truly worshiping on a daily basis.\u201d<br /><b>\n  <i>\u2014Billy Ray Hearn, Founder of Sparrow Records</i>\n</b>",

    "description": "Jean-Paul Sartre's famous autobiography of his first ten years has been widely compared to Rousseau's Confessions. Written when he was fifty-nine years old, The Words is a masterpiece of self-analysis. Sartre the philosopher, novelist and playwright brings to his own childhood the same rigor of honesty and insight he applied so brilliantly to other authors. Born into a gentle, book-loving family and raised by a widowed mother and doting grandparents, he had a childhood which might be described as one long love affair with the printed word. Ultimately, this book explores and evaluates the whole use of books and language in human experience.",

    "description": "Announcing a brand new, cover-to-cover revision of America's pregnancy bible. <i>What to Expect When You're Expecting</i> is a perennial New York Times bestseller and one of USA Today's 25 most influential books of the past 25 years. It's read by more than 90% of pregnant women who read a pregnancy book\u2014the most iconic, must-have book for parents-to-be, with over 14.5 million copies in print.<br /><br /> Now comes the Fourth Edition, a new book for a new generation of expectant moms\u2014featuring a new look, a fresh perspective, and a friendlier-than-ever voice. It's filled with the most up-to-date information reflecting not only what's new in pregnancy, but what's relevant to pregnant women. Heidi Murkoff has rewritten every section of the book, answering dozens of new questions and including loads of new asked-for material, such as a detailed week-by-week fetal development section in each of the monthly chapters, an expanded chapter on pre-conception, and a brand new one on carrying multiples. More comprehensive, reassuring, and empathetic than ever, the Fourth Edition incorporates the most recent developments in obstetrics and addresses the most current lifestyle trends (from tattooing and belly piercing to Botox and aromatherapy). There's more than ever on pregnancy matters practical (including an expanded section on workplace concerns), physical (with more symptoms, more solutions), emotional (more advice on riding the mood roller coaster), nutritional (from low-carb to vegan, from junk food\u2013dependent to caffeine-addicted), and sexual (what's hot and what's not in pregnant lovemaking), as well as much more support for that very important partner in parenting, the dad-to-be.<br /><br /> Overflowing with tips, helpful hints, and humor (a pregnant woman's best friend), this new edition is more accessible and easier to use than ever before. It's everything parents-to-be have come to expect from What to Expect...only better?.",

    "description": "Some things about babies, happily, will never change. They still arrive warm, cuddly, soft, and smelling impossibly sweet. But how moms and dads care for their brand-new bundles of baby joy has changed\u2014and now, so has the new-baby bible. <br /><br /> Announcing the completely revised third edition of <i>What to Expect the First Year</i>. With over 10.5 million copies in print, <i>First Year</i> is the world\u2019s best-selling, best-loved guide to the instructions that babies don\u2019t come with, but should. And now, it\u2019s better than ever. Every parent\u2019s must-have/go-to is completely updated. <br /><br /> Keeping the trademark month-by-month format that allows parents to take the potentially overwhelming first year one step at a time, <i>First Year</i> is easier-to-read, faster-to-flip-through, and new-family-friendlier than ever\u2014packed with even more practical tips, realistic advice, and relatable, accessible information than before. Illustrations are new, too. <br /><br /> Among the changes: Baby care fundamentals\u2014crib and sleep safety, feeding, vitamin supplements\u2014are revised to reflect the most recent guidelines. Breastfeeding gets more coverage, too, from getting started to keeping it going. Hot-button topics and trends are tackled: attachment parenting, sleep training, early potty learning (elimination communication), baby-led weaning, and green parenting (from cloth diapers to non-toxic furniture). An all-new chapter on buying for baby helps parents navigate through today\u2019s dizzying gamut of baby products, nursery items, and gear. Also new: tips on preparing homemade baby food, the latest recommendations on starting solids, research on the impact of screen time (TVs, tablets, apps, computers), and \u201cFor Parents\u201d boxes that focus on mom\u2019s and dad\u2019s needs. Throughout, topics are organized more intuitively than ever, for the best user experience possible.",

    "description": "Warum Nick Hornby seinen neuen Roman <i>About a Boy</i> genannt hat, ist eigentlich am Ende der Lekt\u00fcre nicht ganz klar, denn eigentlich beschreibt er zwei Jungs. Der eine, Will, ist zwar schon 35 Jahre alt und Marcus erst 12. Doch Will ist in seiner Art, sich vor Verantwortung zu dr\u00fccken und andere f\u00fcr seine Zwecke zu benutzen kaum \u00e4lter als Marcus. Wie die beiden sich fanden und warum sie sich wunderbar erg\u00e4nzen, erz\u00e4hlt Nick Hornby in einer rasanten Geschichte.<p> Will hat es nicht n\u00f6tig zu arbeiten, er kann ganz gut von den geerbten Tantiemen seines Vaters leben und mit festen Freundschaften zu Frauen oder gar die Gr\u00fcndung einer Familie hat er herzlich wenig am Hut. Am meisten ha\u00dft er es, wenn wieder einmal eine Beziehung tr\u00e4nenreich zu Ende geht. Bis er auf einen genialen Einfall kommt. Er m\u00fc\u00dfte sich einfach um die schm\u00e4hlich vernachl\u00e4ssigten, alleinerziehenden Frauen k\u00fcmmern. Es mu\u00df Tausende von ihnen \u00fcberall in London geben, -- \"alleinerziehende M\u00fctter, intelligente, attraktive, willige Frauen\", die \"tollen Sex, reichlich Streicheleinheiten f\u00fcrs Ego, Vaterschaft auf Zeit ohne Tr\u00e4nen und eine Trennung ohne Schuldgef\u00fchle -- was konnte ein Mann sich Besseres w\u00fcnschen?\" So beginnt Nicks Karriere als Seriensoftie.</p><p> In seiner Rolle als Will, der Erl\u00f6ser, trifft er Marcus und seine Mutter. Sie gef\u00e4llt ihm auf Anhieb ganz gut, doch Marcus ist ganz und gar nicht der Zw\u00f6lfj\u00e4hrige, wie ihn sich Will vorgestellt hat. Sein Musikgeschmack ist bei Joni Mitchell stehen geblieben, von Curt Cobain hat er keine Ahnung, er tr\u00e4gt die v\u00f6llig verkehrten Schuhe, von Turnschuhen hat er noch nicht geh\u00f6rt, und vor allem nicht davon, da\u00df es darum geht, die Richtigen zu tragen. Sein Haarschnitt ist eher schlicht und von seinen Hosen ganz zu Schweigen. F\u00fcr Marcus ist das Leben in seiner Klasse, wie man sich vorstellen kann, nicht ganz leicht. Und nachdem er sich auch noch in das sch\u00f6nste M\u00e4dchen der Schule verliebt hat, mu\u00df ihm Will schleunigst auf die Spr\u00fcnge helfen. Sonst wird da nichts Vern\u00fcnftiges draus.</p><p> Die Mutter von Marcus ist zwar attraktiv, doch in einer depressiven Stimmung unternimmt sie einen Selbstmordversuch. Ehe er sich versieht hat Will pl\u00f6tzlich, nachdem er wirklich nur an gutem Sex und etwas Unterhaltung interessiert war, eine ganz Menge Probleme am Hals, die sich nicht einfach ignorieren lassen, wenn er sich nur lange genug nicht r\u00fchrt.</p><p> <i>About A Boy</i> handelt vom Erwachsenwerden zweier ganz unterschiedlicher M\u00e4nner. Ihre Schwierigkeiten dabei schildert der Engl\u00e4nder Nick Hornby, der schon mit <i>High Fidelity</i> und <i>Fever Pich -- Ballfieber</i> gro\u00dfe Erfolge gelandet hat, in einem unangestrengten, schnodderigen Ton. Er geht sein Thema locker an, doch immer wieder werden seine beiden Helden vom Ernst des Alltags eingeholt. Mitten in der sch\u00f6nsten Slapstick-Einlage bleibt dabei dem Leser das Lachen im Halse stecken. Gut geschriebene Unterhaltung. <i>--Manuela Haselberger</i></p>",

The potential wealth of the universe is now in malevolent army hands. <br /><br />Rebel billionaire Dan Randolph, possessor of the largest privately owned company in space, intends to weaken the stranglehold the new despotic masters of the solar system have on the lucrative ore industry. But when the mineral-rich asteroid he sets in orbit around the Earth is commandeered by the enemy, and his unarmed workers are slaughtered in cold blood, the course of Randolph's life is changed forever. <br /><br />Now cataclysm is aimed at the exposed heart of America -- a potential catastrophe that Randolph himself inadvertently set in motion. The maverick entrepreneur must use his skills, cunning, and vast resources to strike out at his foes hard, fast, with ruthless precision -- and wear proudly the mantle that fate thrust upon him -- <i>\n  <b>space pirate</b>\n</i>.",

    "description": "Miles Ryan's life seemed to end the day his wife was killed in a hit-and-run accident two years ago. Missy had been his first love, and Miles fervently believes she will be his last. As a deputy in the North Carolina town of New Bern, Miles Ryan not only grieves for Missy, but also longs to bring the unknown driver to justice. Then Miles meets Sarah Andrews. The second grade teacher of his son, Jonah, Sarah had left Baltimore after a difficult divorce to start over in the gentler surroundings of New Bern. Perhaps it's her own emotional wounds that make her sensitive to the hurt she first sees in Jonah's eyes, and then his father's.<br />Tentatively, Sarah and Miles reach out to each other. Soon they are both laughing for the first time in years . . . and falling in love. Neither will be able to guess how closely linked they are to a shocking secret -- one that will force them to question everything they ever believed in . . . and make a heartbreaking choice that will change their lives forever.<br />In A Bend in the Road, Nicholas Sparks writes with a luminous intensity about life's bitter turns and incomparable sweetness. His affirming message carries a powerful lesson about the imperfections of being human, the mistakes we all make, and the joy that comes when we give ourselves to love.<br /><br /><br /><i>Did You Know?---<br /><br />The final draft of A Bend in the Road was 30,000 words shorter than the first draft?<br /><br />Most of the places described in the novel are real?<br /><br />The main character was named after Nicholas's two oldest sons, Miles and Ryan?</i>",

    "description": "This classic of Christian devotional literature has brought understanding and comfort to millions for centuries. Both Protestants and Catholics \u2014 as well as mystics and historians of religious thought \u2014 have studied these meditations on the life and teachings of Jesus, finding in them a path to prayer and spiritual guidance. Written in a candid and conversational style, <i>The Imitation of Chris</i>t discusses liberation from worldly inclinations, recollection as a preparation for prayer, the consolations of prayer, and the place of eucharistic communion in a devout life. With its simple, readable text, this translation will appeal to new readers as well as to those already familiar with this religious classic.",

Now pretty Cassie Connor was free . . .but vulnerable. Devin knew he'd have to tread slowly, all the while wondering if <i>The Heart of Devin MacKade</i> could ever claim the woman he loved. </p><p>The youngest MacKade, Shane, was a man of the land, so the last woman he expected to catch his eye was a Ph.D.-toting academic. But Rebecca Knight had caught much more than that. One beautiful lady didn't mean <i>The Fall of Shane MacKade</i> from bachelorhood was a sure thing. But it was definitely a possibility . . .</p>",

    "description": "Ten years later and the bad boy of the bunch had returned home. Appealing as ever, no even lovely Regan Joners, the town's reserved antiques dealer, was immune to Rafe MacKade. Regan claimed her plans didn't include relationships with rebels, but her reaction to <i>\n  <b>The Return of Rafe MacKade</b>\n</i> - and his sizzling kisses - said something quite different.<br /><br />Attorney Jared MacKade had his pick of women. His dealings with Savannah Morningstar were strictly business, but thoughts of the outragious, direct and sinfully sexy woman kept him coming back for more. With Savannah's incendiary attitude, plus <b>\n  <i>The Pride of Jared MacKade</i>\n</b> something - good or bad - was bound to erupt.",

    "description": "In these pages, <em>Rent</em> offers what most theater books can't: a chance to step behind the curtain and feel the electricity of a stage phenomenon as it unfolds.<em>Rent</em> has single-handedly reinvigorated Broadway and taken America by storm. Sweeping all major theater awards, including the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for drama, as well as four 1996 Tony Awards including Best Musical, Best Book, and Best Score for a Musical, <em>Rent</em> captures the heart and spirit of a generation, refleting it onstage through the emotion of its stirring words and music, and the energy of its young cast. Now, for the first time, <em>Rent</em> comes to life on the page -- through vivid color photographs, the full libretto, and an utterly compelling behind-the-scenes oral history of the show's creation. Here is the exclusive and absolutely complete companion to <em>Rent,</em> told in the voices of the extraordinary talent behind its success: the actors, the director, the producers, and the librettist and composer himself, Jonathan Larson, whose sudden death, on the eve of the first performance, has made <em>Rent's</em> life-affirming message all the more poignant.",

Now she takes on a new chapter in the life of Elizabeth and Nathaniel Bonner--as their brave and beautiful oldest daughter comes of age with a challenge that will change her forever. . . .<br /><br />It is the spring of 1802 and the village of Paradise is still reeling from the typhoid epidemic of the previous summer. But despite a devastating personal loss, the Bonners persevere, with Hannah, Nathaniel's half-Indian daughter, working as a doctor in training. A gifted healer, this striking young woman of two worlds finds herself in peril when a dangerously ill runaway slave is discovered near the family home and Hannah insists on nursing the outlaw. Her determination places both her family and her heart in jeopardy, for a bounty hunter is afoot--and he is none other than Hannah's childhood friend and first love. So begins a journey that will test the strength of the Bonners' love for one another--and bring Hannah to face the decision she has always dreaded: will she make a life for herself in a white world, or among her mother's people?",

    "description": "<i>The Deed of Paksenarrion</i> revolves around the life of Paksenarrion Dorthansdotter, known as Paks. It takes place in a fictional medieval world comprised of kingdoms of humans, dwarves, and elves. The story begins by introducing Paks as a headstrong girl of 18, who leaves her home (fleeing a marriage arranged by her father) to join a mercenary company. Through her journeys and hardships she comes to realize that she has been gifted as a paladin. The novel was originally published in three volumes in 1988 and 1989 and as a single trade edition of that name in 1992. The three books included are <i>The Sheepfarmer's Daughter, Divided Allegiance</i> and <i>Oath of Gold.</i><br /><br />From publisher Baen: \"Paksenarrion, a simple sheepfarmer's daughter, yearns for a life of adventure and glory, such as was known to heroes in songs and story. At age seventeen she runs away from home to join a mercenary company and begins her epic life . . . Book One: Paks is trained as a mercenary, blooded, and introduced to the life of a soldier . . . and to the followers of Gird, the soldier's god. Book Two: Paks leaves the Duke's company to follow the path of Gird alone\u2014and on her lonely quests encounters the other sentient races of her world. Book Three: Paks the warrior must learn to live with Paks the human. She undertakes a holy quest for a lost elven prince that brings the gods' wrath down on her and tests her very limits.\"",

Keturah follows a legendary hart into the king's forest, where she becomes hopelessly lost. Her strength diminishes until, finally, she realizes that death is near. Little does she know that he is a young, handsome lord, melancholy and stern. Renowned for her storytelling, Keturah is able to charm Lord Death with a story and thereby gain a reprieve but only for twenty-four hours. She must find her one true love within that time or all is lost. Keturah searches desperately while the village prepares for an unexpected visit from the king, and Keturah is thrust into a prominent role as mysterious happenings alarm her friends and neighbors. Lord Death's presence hovers over this all until Keturah confronts him one last time in the harrowing climax.",

    "description": "In <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>, J.K. Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season's premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder.<p> Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders? </p><p> But Quidditch buffs need not go into mourning: we get our share of this great game at the World Cup. Attempting to go incognito as Muggles, 100,000 witches and wizards converge on a \"nice deserted moor.\" As ever, Rowling magicks up the details that make her world so vivid, and so comic. Several spectators' tents, for instance, are entirely unquotidian. One is a minipalace, complete with live peacocks; another has three floors and multiple turrets. And the sports paraphernalia on offer includes rosettes \"squealing the names of the players\" as well as \"tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves.\" Needless to say, the two teams are decidedly different, down to their mascots. Bulgaria is supported by the beautiful veela, who instantly enchant everyone--including Ireland's supporters--over to their side. Until, that is, thousands of tiny cheerleaders engage in some pyrotechnics of their own: \"The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field.\"</p><p> Long before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it's true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry's life, the book's emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This <i>Daily Prophet</i> scoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.) And at her bedazzling close, Rowling leaves several plot strands open, awaiting book 5. This fan is ready to wager that the author herself is part veela--her pen her wand, her commitment to her world complete. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>",

    "description": "<i>Eating Well When You're Expecting</i> provides moms-to-be with a realistic approach to navigating healthily and deliciously through the nine months of pregnancy\u2014at home, in the office, over the holidays, in restaurants. Thorough chapters are devoted to nutrition, weight gain, food safety, the postpartum diet, and how to eat when trying to conceive again. And, very exciting, the book comes with 150 contemporary, tasty, and healthy recipes that feed mom and baby well, take little time to prepare, and are gentle on queasy tummies.<br /><br /><i>Eating Well</i> comes with a light, reader-friendly tone while delivering the most up-to-date information. At the heart of the book are hundreds of pressing questions every mother-to-be has:<i> Is it true I shouldn\u2019t eat any food cooked with alcohol? Will the caffeine in coffee cross into my baby\u2019s bloodstream? Help!\u2014I\u2019m entering my second trimester, and I\u2019m losing weight, not gaining. Is all sushi off limits? How do I get enough calcium if I\u2019m lactose intolerant? I keep dreaming about a hot fudge sundae\u2014can I indulge?</i> Guess what: The answer is yes.",

    "description": "Artist's daughter Penelope Keeling can look back on a full and varied life: a Bohemian childhood in London and Cornwall, an unhappy wartime marriage, and the one man she truly loved. She has brought up three children - and learned to accept them as they are. Yet she is far too energetic and independent to settle sweetly into pensioned-off old-age. And when she discovers that her most treasured possession, her father's painting, The Shell Seekers, is now worth a small fortune, it is Penelope who must make the decisions that will determine whether her family can continue to survive as a family, or be split apart.",

    "description": "Against the backdrop of an elegant Cornwall mansion before World War II and a vast continent-spanning canvas during the turbulent war years, this involving story tells of an extraordinary young woman's coming of age, coming to grips with love and sadness, and in every sense of the term, coming home...<br /><br />In 1935, Judith Dunbar is left behind at a British boarding school when her mother and baby sister go off to join her father in Singapore. At Saint Ursula's, her friendship with Loveday Carey-Lewis sweeps her into the privileged, madcap world of the British aristocracy, teaching her about values, friendship, and wealth. But it will be the drama of war, as it wrenches Judith from those she cares about most, that will teach her about courage...and about love.<br /><br />Teeming with marvelous, memorable characters in a novel that is a true masterpiece, <i>Coming Home</i> is a book to be savored, reread, and cherished forever.",

His parents were wizards, killed by a Dark Lord's curse when Harry was just a baby, and which he somehow survived. Escaping from his unbearable Muggle guardians to Hogwarts, a wizarding school brimming with ghosts and enchantments, Harry stumbles into a sinister adventure when he finds a three-headed dog guarding a room on the third floor. Then he hears of a missing stone with astonishing powers which could be valuable, dangerous, or both.<br />(front flap)",

    "description": "For centuries mystical creatures of all description were gathered into a hidden refuge called Fablehaven to prevent their extinction. The sanctuary survives today as one of the last strongholds of true magic. Enchanting? Absolutely. Exciting? You bet. Safe? Well, actually, quite the opposite.<br /><br />Kendra and her brother, Seth, have no idea that their grandfather is the current caretaker of Fablehaven. Inside the gated woods, ancient laws keep relative order among greedy trolls, mischievous satyrs, plotting witches, spiteful imps, and jealous fairies. However, when the rules get broken -- Seth is a bit too curious and reckless for his own good -- powerful forces of evil are unleashed, and Kendra and her brother face the greatest challenge of their lives. To save their family, Fablehaven, and perhaps even the world, Kendra and Seth must find the courage to do what they fear most.",

    "description": "Keith Johnstone's involvement with the theatre began when George Devine and Tony Richardson, artistic directors of the Royal Court Theatre, commissioned a play from him. This was in 1956. A few years later he was himself Associate Artistic Director, working as a play-reader and director, in particular helping to run the Writers' Group. The improvisatory techniques and exercises evolved there to foster spontaneity and narrative skills were developed further in the actors' studio then in demonstrations to schools and colleges and ultimately in the founding of a company of performers, called The Theatre Machine. Divided into four sections, 'Status', 'Spontaneity', 'Narrative Skills', and 'Masks and Trance', arranged more or less in the order a group might approach them, the book sets out the specific techniques and exercises which Johnstone has himself found most useful and most stimulating. The result is both an ideas book and a fascinating exploration of the nature of spontaneous creativity.",

    "description": "With her bestsellers <i>Longitude</i> and <i>Galileo's Daughter</i>, Dava Sobel introduced readers to her rare gift for weaving complex scientific concepts into a compelling narrative. Now Sobel brings her full talents to bear on what is perhaps her most ambitious topic to date-the planets of our solar system. Sobel explores the origins and oddities of the planets through the lens of popular culture, from astrology, mythology, and science fiction to art, music, poetry, biography, and history.

His experience as founder of the acclaimed Annoyance Theatre/Annoyance Productions, as well as Resident Director and Artistic Consultant for The Second City, has led him to continually question why and how scenes work or don't work and what one must do in order for a scene to be successful.<br /><br />In this book, Napier takes an irreverent, but constructive look at the art and practice of improvised scenes. He covers such topics as: two-person scenes group scenes entering scenes techniques to achieve richer, more layered scenes auditioning solo exercises for practice at home. Napier also challenges the conventional wisdom of the \"rules\" of improvisation, examining what's behind them and how they came to be in the first place.<br /><br />Get helpful, tangible guidelines for bringing strength and direction to your scenes. Just \"Improvise.\"",

    "description": "Con su Inteligencia intuitiva Malcolm Gladwell se ha propuesto revolucionar la forma de entender nuestro mundo interior. Es un libro sobre c\u00f3mo pensamos sin pensar, sobre decisiones que parece que se toman en dos segundos, pero que no son tan simples como aparentan. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 algunas personas son brillantes tomando decisiones y otras son torpes una y otra vez? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 algunos siguen su instinto y triunfan, mientras que otros acaban siempre dando un paso en falso? \u00bfCu\u00e1l es el funcionamiento real del cerebro en el trabajo, en clase, en la cocina o en la cama? \u00bfY por qu\u00e9 las mejores decisiones suelen ser las m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles de explicar? Gladwell nos presenta a un psic\u00f3logo que ha aprendido a predecir si un matrimonio puede durar con s\u00f3lo observarles unos minutos; a un entrenador de tenis que sabe cu\u00e1ndo un jugador har\u00e1 doble falta antes incluso de que la raqueta toque la bola; a un experto en antig\u00fcedades que reconoce una falsificaci\u00f3n de un solo vistazo.Este libro revela que quienes son buenos tomando decisiones no son aquellos que procesan m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n o que dedican m\u00e1s tiempo a deliberar, sino aquellos que han perfeccionado el arte de hilar fino, de extraer los pocos factores que realmente importan a partir de una cantidad desmesurada de variables. Por medio de la neurolog\u00eda y la psicolog\u00eda, y exhibiendo todo el esplendor del que este autor es capaz, Inteligencia intuitiva cambia nuestra forma de ver las decisiones que tomamos. Nunca m\u00e1s volver\u00e1s a pensar en pensar de la misma manera",

    "description": "<b>\"A fine, well-rounded portrait of Harper Lee. Mockingbird is good reading.\"\u2014Star-Tribune (Minneapolis)</b><br /><br /><i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>\u2014the twentieth century's most widely read American novel\u2014has sold thirty million copies and still sells a million yearly. Yet despite her book's perennial popularity, its creator, Harper Lee, has become a somewhat mysterious figure. Now, after years of research, Charles J. Shields brings to life the warmhearted, high-spirited, and occasionally hardheaded woman who gave us two of American literature's most unforgettable characters\u2014Atticus Finch and his daughter, Scout.<br /><br />At the center of Shields's evocative, lively book is the story of Lee's struggle to create her famous novel, but her colorful life contains many highlights\u2014her girlhood as a tomboy in overalls in tiny Monroeville, Alabama; the murder trial that made her beloved father's reputation and inspired her great work; her journey to Kansas as Truman Capote's ally and research assistant to help report the story of <i>In Cold Blood</i>. <i>Mockingbird</i>\u2014unique, highly entertaining, filled with humor and heart\u2014is a wide-ranging, idiosyncratic portrait of a writer, her dream, and the place and people whom she made immortal.",

    "description": "In \"Matter and Consciousness,\" Paul Churchland clearly presents the advantages and disadvantages of such difficult issues in philosophy of mind as behaviorism, reductive materialism, functionalism, and eliminative materialism. This new edition incorporates the striking developments that have taken place in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence and notes their expanding relevance to philosophical issues.<br /><br />Churchland organizes and clarifies the new theoretical and experimental results of the natural sciences for a wider philosophical audience, observing that this research bears directly on questions concerning the basic elements of cognitive activity and their implementation in real physical systems. (How is it, he asks, that living creatures perform some cognitive tasks so swiftly and easily, where computers do them only badly or not at all?) Most significant for philosophy, Churchland asserts, is the support these results tend to give to the reductive and the eliminative versions of materialism.<br /><br />\"A Bradford Book\"",

How did it happen? Where is it headed?<br /><br /> In <i>Smartbomb</i>, journalists Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby take the reader behind the scenes at gaming conventions, into powerhouse think tanks where new games are created, into the thick of the competition at cyberathlete tournaments, and into the homes of gamers for whom playing a role in a virtual world has assumed more relevance and reality than life in the real world.",

    "description": "This captivating little pictorial autobiography for adults, a life told through clothes, features Beckerman's brightly colored drawings of the vestments she wore at different times in her life, accompanied by diarylike entries. She grew up in Manhattan in the 1940s and '50s, and we see her elementary school outfit, ballet costume, prom dress, etc. After her mother died, her grandparents, not wanting her to live with her father, took in Ilene and her sister; she never saw her father again. In 1955, at 20, she married her 37-year-old sociology professor in Boston. They soon divorced, and in her second marriage, which also ended in divorce, she had six children, losing one in infancy. She is now v-p of an advertising agency. Beckerman's extremely reticent text never illuminates these events, but her minimalist self-portrait is a wry commentary on the pressures women constantly face to look good. <br />Source: PW",

    "description": "Bestselling author Jamie Oliver finally devotes an entire book to America's favorite cuisine -- Italian! Italy and its wonderful flavors have always had a major influence on Jamie Oliver\u2019s food and cooking. In <i>Jamie\u2019s Italy</i>, he travels this famously gastronomic country paying homage to the classic dishes of each region and searching for new ideas to bring home. The result is a sensational collection of Italian recipes, old and new, that will ensure that Italy\u2019s influence reaches us all. <p>Italy has inspired Jamie Oliver throughout his career. His ambition has always been to travel across the country on a quest to capture the very essence of Italian cooking -- and to produce the best and simplest Italian cookbook for everybody anywhere to enjoy. </p><p><i>Jamie\u2019s Italy</i> is the result of that journey -- and it\u2019s a land of plenty. As well as providing more than 120 brand-new recipes for everything from risotto to roasts and spaghetti to stews, structured as traditional trattoria menus, Jamie takes you all over Italy to cook with and learn from the real masters of Italian cuisine: the locals. Far from the standard \"lemons and olives\" version of Italian cooking, <i>Jamie\u2019s Italy</i> is a cookbook by the people for the people. From Sicily to Tuscany, it\u2019s about the local fishermen, family bakers, and, of course, the \"Mamas,\" sharing their recipes and the tips that have gone into their cooking for generations. But it\u2019s not only mouthwatering food that Jamie brings back home: it\u2019s also the spirit that makes cooking and eating absolutely central to family life, whichever part of Italy you\u2019re in. </p><p>Bursting with the warmth and hospitality of real family life, this is both a superbly accessible cookbook and a unique travelogue and diary, in which you\u2019ll find the authentic flavor of Italy and the people who live there. If you love quality food prepared with genuine passion -- you\u2019ll never want to leave <i>Jamie\u2019s Italy</i>.</p>",

    "description": "This compelling and fundamentally liberating book shows us that examining our attitudes toward money\u2014earning it, spending it, and giving it away\u2014can offer surprising insight into our lives, our values, and the essence of prosperity. Through personal stories and practical advice, global activist Lynne Twist demonstrates how we can replace feelings of scarcity, guilt, and burden with experiences of sufficiency, freedom, and purpose. Twist takes an honest and critical look at the extraordinary power that money wields over our lives and its profound and often destructive influence on our self-image and relationships. In a consumer society that glorifies the pitch, the sale, and the insatiable appetite for more as a measure of self-worth, <em>?The Soul of Money</em>? asks us to step back, to examine our relationship with money, to assess our connection with core human values, and to change this relationship and, in so doing, to transform our lives.",

    "description": "For many, trying to discover \"God's will\" is a confusing and frustrating process. In an effort to divine God's will, people try praying harder, meditating more on Scripture, or briefly living a better life. But as this insightful book shows, such activities have more in common with paganism than with biblical Christianity.<br /><br />Exploring a misunderstood area of Christian concern, Bruce Waltke asks, Can we ever know God's will? In pursuit of a satisfying answer, he examines many practices that Christians pass off as divine guidance -- following hunches, casting lots, looking for signs, and others -- and suggests that such practices actually bear an unsettling resemblance to the ways pagans seek divine guidance. Instead, Waltke gently shows readers that the truest course to the will of God is found in faithfully answering the call to walk close to the Lord and be conformed to his likeness. Only then will we have the heart of God and know what pleases him.<br /><br />Packed with clear, practical advice for meaningful Christian living, <i>Finding the Will of God</i> will be valued by all.",

    "description": "<i>Flipped</i> is a romance told in two voices. The first time Juli Baker saw Bryce Loski, she flipped. The first time Bryce saw Juli, he ran. That\u2019s pretty much the pattern for these two neighbors until the eighth grade, when, just as Juli is realizing Bryce isn\u2019t as wonderful as she thought, Bryce is starting to see that Juli is pretty amazing. How these two teens manage to see beyond the surface of things and come together makes for a comic and poignant romance.",

    "description": "The philosophy of utilitarianism can trace its origins back thousands of years but it's most famously associated with the 18th century English philosopher Jeremy Bentham. The basic principle of utilitarianism is that ones actions should be guided towards outcomes that create the greatest good for the greatest numbers of people. This simple guiding principle creates a host of challenging moral dilemmas. John Stuart Mill's \"Utilitarianism\" is the classic exposition of this simple and yet complex philosophy.",

    "description": "These works, as the subtitle makes clear, are unfinished sketches for Philosophical Investigations, among the most important &amp; influential philosophical work of modern times. The 'Blue Book' is a set of notes dictated to Witgenstein's Cambridge students in 1933-34. The 'Brown Book' was a draft for what eventually became the growth of the first part of Philosophical Investigations. This book reveals the germination &amp; growth of the ideas which found their final expression in Witgenstein's later work. It's indispensable therefore to students of Witgenstein's thought &amp; to all those who wish to study at firsthand the mental processes of a thinker who fundamentally changed the course of modern philosophy.<br />Preface<br />The Blue Book<br />The Brown Book<br />Index",

    "description": "Peter Winch's translation of Wittgenstein's remarks on culture &amp; value presents all entries chronologically, with the German text alongside the English &amp; a subject index for reference.<br /> \"It was Wittgenstein's habit to record his thoughts in sequences of more or less closely related 'remarks' which he kept in notebooks throughout his life. The editor of this collection has gone through these notebooks in order to select those 'remarks' which deal with Wittgenstein's views about the less technical issues in his philosophy. So here we have Wittgenstein's thoughts about religion, music, architecture, the nature of philosophy, the spirit of our times, genius, being Jewish &amp; so on. The work is a masterpiece by a mastermind.\"\u2014Leonard Linsky",

    "description": "In 1892 Stephen Crane (1871-1900) published <i>Maggie, Girl of the Streets</i> at his own expense. Considered at the time to be immature, it was a failure. Since that time it has come to be considered one of the earliest American realistic novels. <i>Maggie</i> is the story of a pretty child of the Bowery which is written with the same intensity and vivid scenes of his masterpiece -- <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i>. In her short life, Maggie \"blossomed in a mud puddle\", was driven to prostitution, and died by her own hand while still a teenager.<br /><p><br />Crane, who worked as a free lance reporter, was in many ways addicted to the low life of the cities. He died at the age of 29.</p>",

    "description": "For sixty years, Jews have prospered in the Federal District of Sitka, a \"temporary\" safe haven created in the wake of revelations of the Holocaust and the shocking 1948 collapse of the fledgling state of Israel. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown.<br /><br />For sixty years, Jewish refugees and their descendants have prospered in the Federal District of Sitka, a \"temporary\" safe haven created in the wake of revelations of the Holocaust and the shocking 1948 collapse of the fledgling state of Israel. Proud, grateful, and longing to be American, the Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant, gritty, soulful, and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. For sixty years they have been left alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown. <br /><br />But homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. He and his half-Tlingit partner, Berko Shemets, can't catch a break in any of their outstanding cases. Landsman's new supervisor is the love of his life\u2014and also his worst nightmare. And in the cheap hotel where he has washed up, someone has just committed a murder\u2014right under Landsman's nose. Out of habit, obligation, and a mysterious sense that it somehow offers him a shot at redeeming himself, Landsman begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy. But when word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, Landsman soon finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, hopefulness, evil, and salvation that are his heritage\u2014and with the unfinished business of his marriage to Bina Gelbfish, the one person who understands his darkest fears. <br /><br />At once a gripping whodunit, a love story, an homage to 1940s noir, and an exploration of the mysteries of exile and redemption, The Yiddish Policemen's Union is a novel only Michael Chabon could have written.<br />(front flap)",

    "description": "For several terms at Cambridge in 1939, Ludwig Wittgenstein lectured on the philosophical foundations of mathematics. A lecture class taught by Wittgenstein, however, hardly resembled a lecture. <br /><br />He sat on a chair in the middle of the room, with some of the class sitting in chairs, some on the floor. He never used notes. He paused frequently, sometimes for several minutes, while he puzzled out a problem. He often asked his listeners questions and reacted to their replies. Many meetings were largely conversation. <br /><br />These lectures were attended by, among others, D. A. T. Gasking, J. N. Findlay, Stephen Toulmin, Alan Turing, G. H. von Wright, R. G. Bosanquet, Norman Malcolm, Rush Rhees, and Yorick Smythies. Notes taken by these last four are the basis for the thirty-one lectures in this book. <br /><br />The lectures covered such topics as the nature of mathematics, the distinctions between mathematical and everyday languages, the truth of mathematical propositions, consistency and contradiction in formal systems, the logicism of Frege and Russell, Platonism, identity, negation, and necessary truth. The mathematical examples used are nearly always elementary.",

    "description": "<i>The Worldly Philosophers</i> not only enables us to see more deeply into our history but helps us better understand our own times. In this seventh edition, Robert L. Heilbroner provides a new theme that connects thinkers as diverse as Adam Smith and Karl Marx. The theme is the common focus of their highly varied ideas\u2014namely, the search to understand how a capitalist society works. It is a focus never more needed than in this age of confusing economic headlines.<br />In a bold new concluding chapter entitled \u201cThe End of the Worldly Philosophy?\u201d Heilbroner reminds us that the word \u201cend\u201d refers to both the purpose and limits of economics. This chapter conveys a concern that today\u2019s increasingly \u201cscientific\u201d economics may overlook fundamental social and political issues that are central to economics. Thus, unlike its predecessors, this new edition provides not just an indispensable illumination of our past but a call to action for our future. (amazon.com)",

Knight granted Feinstein an unprecedented inside look at college basketball -- with complete access to every moment of the season. Feinstein saw and heard it all -- practices, team meetings, strategy sessions, and mid-game huddles -- during Knight's struggle to avoid a losing season.<br /><br />\"A Season on the Brink\" not only captures the drama and pressure of big-time college basketball but paints a vivid portrait of a complex, brilliant coach walking a fine line between genius and madness.",

Getting lost in her high powered career provides the sense of purpose she yearns for. Until the day she's downsized out of her job and the doctor tells her the cancer may be back. It's a double blow that would send anyone reeling. It also sends Karen to Grandma Rose's old farm, where her sister has made a seemingly perfect life. Opening herself to the unexpected, Karen finds a lonely child in need of nurturing and insights into her family's past. And in the quiet of the Missouri Ozarks, she begins to discover the joy to make her life complete.",

    "description": "Tatyana Tolstaya's short stories \u2014 with their unpredictable fairy-tale plots, appealingly eccentric characters, and stylistic abundance and flair \u2014 established her in the 1980s as one of modern Russia's finest writers. Since then her work has been translated throughout the world. Edna O'Brien has called Tolstaya \"an enchantress.\" Anita Desai has spoken of her work's \"richness and ardent life.\" Mixing heartbreak and humor, dizzying flights of fantasy and plunging descents to earth, Tolstaya is the natural successor in a great Russian literary lineage that includes Gogol, Yuri Olesha, Bulgakov, and Nabokov.<br /><br /><i>White Walls</i> is the most comprehensive collection of Tolstaya's short fiction to be published in English so far. It presents the contents of her two previous collections, <i>On the Golden Porch</i> and <i>Sleepwalker in a Fog</i>, along with several previously uncollected stories. Tolstaya writes of lonely children and lost love, of philosophers of the absurd and poets working as janitors, of angels and halfwits. She shows how the extraordinary will suddenly erupt in the midst of ordinary life, as she explores the human condition with a matchless combination of unbound imagination and unapologetic sympathy.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i>A New York Review Books Original</i>\n</b><br /><br />\"Tolstaya carves indelible people who roam the imagination long after the book is put down.\" --<i>Time</i>",

It was her refuge from the deep wounds inflicted by a devastating war, her sanctuary where she knelt before a loving God and prayed for the children who couldn\u2019t understand her silent sacrifices.<br /><br />Now, eighty-four-year-old Leota Reinhardt is alone, her beloved garden in ruins. All her efforts to reconcile with her adult children have been fruitless, and she voices her despair to a loving Father, her only friend.<br /><br />Then God brings a wind of change through unlikely means: one, a college student who thinks he has all the answers; the other, the granddaughter Leota never hoped to know. But can the devastation wrought by keeping painful family secrets be repaired before she runs out of time?",

It has been a celebrated classic of Indian literature for 1,700 years and a window for the West into the culture and mysticism of the East. <br /><br />This Modern Library Paperback Classic reprints the authoritative text of Sir Richard F.

    "description": "<b>From the author of <i>Music for Torching</i>-an uplifting and apocalyptic tale set in Los Angeles about one man's efforts to bring himself back to life</b> <br /><br /> Since her debut in 1989, A. M. Homes has been among the boldest and most original voices of her generation, acclaimed for the psychological accuracy and unnerving emotional intensity of her storytelling. Her keen ability to explore how extraordinary the ordinary can be is at the heart of her touching and funny new novel, her first in six years. <p> Richard Novak is a modern-day Everyman, a middle-aged divorc\u00e9 trading stocks out of his home. He has done such a good job getting his life under control that he needs no one- except his trainer, nutritionist, and housekeeper. He is functionally dead and doesn't even notice until two incidents-an attack of intense pain that lands him in the emergency room, and the discovery of an expanding sinkhole outside his house-conspire to hurl him back into the world. On his way home from the hospital, Richard forms the first of many new relationships: He meets Anhil, the doughnut shop owner, an immigrant who dreams big. He finds a weeping housewife in the produce section of the supermarket, helps save a horse that has fallen into the sinkhole, daringly rescues a woman from the trunk of her kidnapper's car, and, after the sinkhole claims his house and he has to relocate to a Malibu rental, he befriends a reluctant counterculture icon. In the end, Richard is also brought back in closer touch with his family-his aging parents, his brilliant brother, the beloved ex-wife whom he still desires, and finally, before the story's breathtaking finale, with his estranged son Ben. </p><p> The promised land of Los Angeles-a surreal city of earthquakes, wildfires, mudslides, and feral Chihuahuas-is also very much a character in <i>This Book Will Save Your Life</i>. A vivid, revealing novel about compassion, transformation, and what can happen if you are willing to lose yourself and open up to the world around you, it should significantly broaden Homes's already substantial audience.</p>",

So begins Thisbe Nissen\u2019s breathtaking debut novel, a decidedly urban fairy tale that follows Roz and Edwin as they move from improbable courtship to marriage to the birth of daughter Miranda\u2013the locus of all Roz\u2019s attention, anxiety, and often smothering affection. <br />As Miranda comes of age and begins to chafe against the intensity of her mother\u2019s neurotic love, Roz must do her best to let those she cherishes move into the world without her. On crowded subways, in strange bedrooms, at Bar Mitzvahs, in brownstone basements and high school gymnasiums, Nissen\u2019s unforgettable characters make their hilarious and wrenching way\u2013and prove, indeed, that good things thrive in New York City.",

In Taormina, Sicily, they cheerfully disagree with Mrs. Tweedie's 1904 assertion that the beautiful town \"is being spoilt,\" and skip the Grand Tour in favor of swimming holes, table soccer, and taureaux piscine. In Paris, they spend a day on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es comparing Freetime's \"le Hitburger\" to McDonald's Big Mac. In Spain, Trillin wonders whether he will run out of Spanish \"the way someone might run out of flour or eggs.\" Filled with Trillin's characteristic humor, <i>Travels with Alice</i> is the perfect book for summer travelers.",

She has also published a short story collection, <i>Travellers in Magic</i>, and numerous short stories. Her novels and short stories have been finalists for the Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy awards. \"She has given us the kind of magic and adventure that once upon a time made us look for secret panels in the walls of wardrobes, or brush our teeth with a book held in front of our eyes, because we couldn't bear to put it down,\" said <i>The New Yorker.</i><br /><br />In her most ambitious novel yet, Lisa Goldstein tells the story of Ruthie, a young journalist sent to interview Jerry, an older man who as a child was the central character of a series of classic childrens books written by his mother, the Adventures of Jeremy in Neverwas. But Jerry's scary fantastic world is real and sucks them in to strange adventures underground, where love and death threaten.",

Landes's acclaimed, best-selling exploration of one of the most contentious and hotly debated questions of our time: Why do some nations achieve economic success while others remain mired in poverty? The answer, as Landes definitively illustrates, is a complex interplay of cultural mores and historical circumstance. Rich with anecdotal evidence, piercing analysis, and a truly astonishing range of erudition, <em>The Wealth and Poverty of Nations\u00a0</em>is a \"picture of enormous sweep and brilliant insight\" (Kenneth Arrow) as well as one of the most audaciously ambitious works of history in decades.<br /><br /><br />For the paperback edition, Landes has written a new epilogue, in which he takes account of Asian financial crisises and the international tension between overconfidence and reality.",

    "description": "An award-winning journalist breaks through the wall of secrecy to reveal the many astonishing ways Wal-Mart's power affects our lives and reaches all around the world. <br /> The Wal-Mart Effect: The overwhelming impact of the world's largest company--due to its relentless pursuit of low prices--on retailers and manufacturers, wages and jobs, the culture of shopping, the shape of our communities, and the environment; a global force of unprecedented nature. Wal-Mart is not only the world's largest company; it is also the largest company in the history of the world. Americans spend $26 million \"every hour\" at Wal-Mart, twenty-four hours of every day, every day of the year. Is the company a good thing or a bad thing? On the one hand, market guru Warren Buffett estimates that the company's low prices save American consumers $10 billion a year. On the other, the behemoth is the #1 employer in thirty-seven of the fifty states yet has never let a union in the door. <br /> Though 70 percent of Americans now live within a fifteen-minute drive of a Wal-Mart store, we have not even begun to understand the true power of the company and the many ways it is shaping American life. We know about the lawsuits and the labor protests, but what we don't know is how profoundly the \"Wal-Mart effect\" is shaping our lives. <br /> \"Fast Company\" senior editor Fishman, whose revelatory cover story on Wal-Mart generated the strongest reader response in the history of the magazine, takes us on an unprecedented behind-the-scenes investigative expedition deep inside the many worlds of Wal-Mart. He reveals the radical ways in which the company is transforming America's economy, our workforce, our communities, and our environment. Fishman penetrated the secrecy of Wal-Mart headquarters, interviewing twenty-five high-level ex-executives; he journeyed into the world of a host of Wal-Mart's suppliers to uncover how the company strong-arms even the most established brands; and journeyed to the ports and factories, the fields and forests where Wal-Mart's power is warping the very structure of the world's market for goods. Wal-Mart is not just a retailer anymore, Fishman argues. It has become a kind of economic ecosystem, and anyone who wants to understand the forces shaping our world today must understand the company's hidden reach.",

With dramatic eloquence, he brings to life a time of terror and treason, a starving people rising in frenzy and hate to overthrow a corrupt and decadent regime. With insight and compassion, Dickens casts his novel of unforgettable scenes with some memorable characters: the sinister Madame Defarge, knitting her patterns of death; the gentle Lucie Manette, unswerving in her devotion to her broken father; Charles Darnay, the lover with a secret past; and dissolute Sydney Carton, whose unlikely heroism gives his life meaning.<br />--penguinrandomhouse.com",

    "description": "<i>'What if everything in the world were a misunderstanding, what if laughter were really tears?'</i> <br /><br /><i>Either/Or</i> is the earliest of the major works of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, one of the most startlingly original thinkers and writers of the nineteenth century, and the first which he wrote under a pseudonym, as he would for his greatest philosophical writings. Adopting the viewpoints of two distinct figures with radically different beliefs--the aesthetic young man of Part One, called simply 'A', and the ethical Judge Vilhelm of the second section--Kierkegaard reflects upon the search for a meaningful existence, contemplating subjects as diverse as Mozart, drama, boredom, and, in the famous Seducer's Diary, the cynical seduction and ultimate rejection of a young, beautiful woman. A masterpiece of duality, <i>Either/Or</i> is an exploration of the conflict between the aesthetic and the ethical--both meditating ironically and seductively upon Epicurean pleasures, and eloquently expounding the noble virtues of a morally upstanding life.<br /><br />This lightly abridged edition fully conveys the vigour and eloquence of the original. Alastair Hannay's introduction explains the philosophical background to the work and places it in the context of its times.",

    "description": "Her name is Dinah. In the Bible, her life is only hinted at in a brief and violent detour within the more familiar chapters of the Book of Genesis that are about her father, Jacob, and his dozen sons. <br />Told in Dinah's voice, this novel reveals the traditions and turmoils of ancient womanhood-the world of the red tent. It begins with the story of her mothers-Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah-the four wives of Jacob. They love Dinah and give her gifts that are to sustain her through a damaged youth, a calling to midwifery, and a new home in a foreign land. Dinah's story reaches out from a remarkable period of early history and creates an intimate, immediate connection. <br />Deeply affecting, \"The Red Tent \"combines rich storytelling with a valuable achievement in modern fiction: a new view of Biblical women's society.<br />",

    "description": "A Gesture Life by Chang-rae Lee is a taut, suspenseful story about love, family, and community, and the secrets we all harbor. It is the story of a proper man, an upstanding citizen who comes to epitomize the decorous values of his New York suburban town. Yet as his story unfolds, precipitated by events that take place around him, we see his life begin to unravel. <br /><br />Courteous, honest, hardworking, and impenetrable, Franklin Hata, a Japanese man of Korean birth, is careful never to overstep his bounds. He makes his neighbors feel comfortable in his presence, keeps his garden well tended, bids his customers good-bye at the doorway to his medical supply shop, and ignores the taunts of local boys. Now facing his retirement years alone, Hata begins to reflect on the price he's had to pay for living this quiet \"gesture life.\"<br /><br />After suffering minor injuries in an accidental fire, he remembers the painful, failed relationships of his past; with Mary Burns, a widow with whom he had an affair, and with Sunny, a Korean girl he adopted when she was seven, who is now a grown woman he hasn't spoken to or seen in years. As Hata recalls the strained, troubled relationship with Sunny, he begins to understand why his daughter, unlike himself, \"felt no more at home in this town, or in this house of mine, or perhaps even with me, than when she first arrived at Kennedy Airport.\"<br /><br />Unknown to Sunny, there is a secret that has shaped the core of Hata's being; his terrible, forbidden love for a young Korean woman from his past. Serving as a medic in the Japanese army during World War II, Hata was assigned the task of overseeing the female \"volunteers; women taken against their will to provide sexual favors for the men in the battalion. One of these \"comfort women\" he came to love. These remembrances, tinged with grief and regret, ultimately draw Hata once again to his daughter; and help him begin to attain a more truthful understanding of himself.",

    "description": "David Quammen's book, <i>The Song of the Dodo</i>, is a brilliant, stirring work, breathtaking in its scope, far-reaching in its message -- a crucial book in precarious times, which radically alters the way in which we understand the natural world and our place in that world. It's also a book full of entertainment and wonders. <br /> In <i>The Song of the Dodo</i>, we follow Quammen's keen intellect through the ideas, theories, and experiments of prominent naturalists of the last two centuries. We trail after him as he travels the world, tracking the subject of island biogeography, which encompasses nothing less than the study of the origin and extinction of all species. Why is this island idea so important? Because islands are where species most commonly go extinct -- and because, as Quammen points out, we live in an age when all of Earth's landscapes are being chopped into island-like fragments by human activity. <br /> Through his eyes, we glimpse the nature of evolution and extinction, and in so doing come to understand the monumental diversity of our planet, and the importance of preserving its wild landscapes, animals, and plants. We also meet some fascinating human characters. By the book's end we are wiser, and more deeply concerned, but Quammen leaves us with a message of excitement and hope.",

The bitch had it coming.",

Scrupulously recording her steps down the path Providence has set her upon--from child to determined young adult to loving mother--she shares the turbulent events, both joyous and tragic, that molded her and recalls the enduring love with cavalry officer Captain Jack Elliot that gave her strength and purpose.<br /><br />Rich in authentic everyday details and alive with truly unforgettable characters, <i>These Is My Words</i> brilliantly brings a vanished world to breathtaking life again.",

    "description": "The small town of Paradise, Pennsylvania, is a jewel in Lancaster County - known for its picture-postcard landscapes and bucolic lifestyle. But that peace is shattered by the discovery of a dead infant in the barn of an Amish farmer. A police investigation quickly leads to two startling disclosures: the newborn's mother is an unmarried Amish woman, eighteen-year-old Katie Fisher. And the infant did not die of natural causes. Although Katie denies the medical proof that she gave birth to the child, circumstantial evidence leads to her arrest for the murder of her baby. <br /><br />One hundred miles away, Philadelphia defense attorney Ellie Hathaway has achieved an enviable, high-profile career. But her latest court victory has set the sands shifting beneath her. Single at thirty-nine and unsatisfied with her relationship, Ellie doesn't look back when she turns down her chance to make partner and takes off for an open-ended stay at her great-aunt's home in Paradise. Fate brings her to Katie Fisher. Suddenly, Ellie sees the chance to defend a client who truly needs her, not just one who can afford her. <br /><br />But taking on this case challenges Ellie in more ways than one. She finds herself not only in a clash of wills with a client who does not want to be defended but also in a clash of cultures with a people whose channels of justice are markedly different from her own. Immersing herself in Katie Fisher's life -- and in a world founded on faith, humility, duty, and honesty -- Ellie begins to understand the pressures and sacrifices of those who to live plain. As she peels away the layers of fact and fantasy, Ellie calls on an old friend for guidance. Now, just as this man from Ellie's past reenters her life, she must uncover the truth about a complex case, a tragic loss, the bonds of love -- and her own deepest fears and desires.",

    "description": "Charmingly illustrated and refreshingly spare, Plain and Simple speaks to the seeker in each of us.<br /><br />\"I had an obsession with the Amish. Plan and simple. Objectively it made no sense. I, who worked hard at being special, fell in love with a people who valued being ordinary.\" So begins Sue Bender's story, the captivating and inspiring true story of a harried urban Californian moved by the beauty of a display of quilts to seek out and live with the Amish. Discovering lives shaped by unfamiliar yet comforting ideas about time, work, and community, Bender is gently coaxed to consider, \"Is there another way to lead a good life?\"<br /><br />Her journey begins in a New York men's clothing store. There she is spellbound by the vibrant colors and stunning geometric simplicity of the Amish quilts \"spoke directly to me,\" writes Bender. Somehow, \"they went straight to my heart.\"<br /><br />Heeding a persistent inner voice, Bender searches for Amish families willing to allow her to visit and share in there daily lives. Plain and Simple vividly recounts sojourns with two Amish families, visits during which Bender enters a world without television, telephone, electric light, or refrigerators; a world where clutter and hurry are replaced with inner quiet and calm ritual; a world where a sunny kitchen \"glows\" and \"no distinction was made between the sacred and the everyday.\"<br /><br />In nine interrelated chapters--as simple and elegant as a classic nine-patch Amish quilt--Bender shares the quiet power she found reflected in lives of joyful simplicity, humanity, and clarity. The fast-paced, opinionated, often frazzled Bender returns home and reworks her \"crazy-quilt\" life, integrating the soul-soothing qualities she has observed in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns formed by the distinctive \"patches\" of her own life.",

    "description": "A finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, Duong Van Mai Elliott's <em>The Sacred Willow</em> illuminates recent Vietnamese history by weaving together the stories of the lives of four generations of her family. Beginning with her great-grandfather, who rose from rural poverty to become an influential landowner, and continuing to the present, Mai Elliott traces her family's journey through an era of tumultuous change. She tells us of childhood hours in her grandmother's silk shop, and of hiding while French troops torched her village, watching while blossoms torn by fire from the trees flutter \"like hundreds of butterflies\" overhead. She makes clear the agonizing choices that split Vietnamese families: her eldest sister left her staunchly anti-communist home to join the Viet Minh, and spent months sleeping in jungle camps with her infant son, fearing air raids by day and tigers by night. And she follows several family members through the last, desperate hours of the fall of Saigon-including one nephew who tried to escape by grabbing the skid of a departing American helicopter. Based on family papers, dozens of interviews, and a wealth of other research, this is not only a memorable family saga but a record of how the Vietnamese themselves have experienced their times.<br />",

    "description": "Buchner's special quality, and that which makes him seem more contemporary than almost anything written today, is his total, uncompromising honesty of emotion and intellect. The German writer Georg Buchner, who died in 1837 aged 23, left only three works for the theatre. Danton's Death, his great fresco of the French Revolution, was written in five weeks when Buchner was under threat of arrest for his own revolutionary activities. His sad comedy, Leonce and Lena, was composed in haste for a publisher's competition for which it was entered too late. The extraordinary proletarian tragedy Woyzeck was left unfinished at Buchner's death. Virtually unknown until the end of the nineteenth century, the plays have found an important place in the modern international repertory.",

    "description": "A luminous first novel, set in Greece, Scotland, Greenwich Village, and Long Island, that traces the members of a Scottish family as they confront the joys and longings, fulfillments and betrayals of love in all its guises.<br /><br />In June of 1989 Paul McLeod, a newspaper publisher and recent widower, travels to Greece, where he falls for a young American artist and reflects on the complicated truth about his marriage. <br /><br />Six years later, again in June, Paul's death draws his three grown sons and their families back to their ancestral home. Fenno, the eldest, a wry, introspective gay man, narrates the events of this unforeseen reunion. Far from his straitlaced expatriate life as a bookseller in Greenwich Village, Fenno is stunned by a series of revelations that threaten his carefully crafted defenses. <br /><br />Four years farther on, in yet another June, a chance meeting on the Long Island shore brings Fenno together with Fern Olitsky, the artist who once captivated his father. Now pregnant, Fern must weigh her guilt about the past against her wishes for the future and decide what family means to her. <br /><br />In prose rich with compassion and wit, <i>Three Junes</i> paints a haunting portrait of love's redemptive powers.",

The white lies name was \"Dominic,\" the ideal boyfriend: charming, successful, the kind of prospective son-in-law that would make any mother proud. But now that Sophy's thin and beautiful sister, Belinda, is getting married, Dominic is going to have to make an appearance in the flesh -- which should be a pretty neat trick ... since the genuine article vanished from Sophy's life after a single, singularly unmemorable evening. So she resorts to a very drastic measure -- aka Josh Carmichael, the escort she hires at the very last minute, sight unseen.<br /><br />But the trouble with white lies is that they tend to multiply. The trouble with rugged, too-sexy, and independent Josh is ... well, that Sophy's actually beginning to like him! Even if they make it through the Wedding Day from Hell together -- with its new intrigues, old flames, and all-too-familiar faces -- there's the night that follows... and, of course, the morning after. And that could end up being the biggest trouble of all!<br /><br />A hip, witty, and freshly fantastic delight, Asking for Trouble is the most hilarious and knowing novel to make the scene since Bridget Jones first set pen to paper to record her most intimate innermost thoughts.",

Two--the marvelous Manley Boys--look suspiciously like a pair of crime-solving brothers named Frank and Joe Hardy. Two others are a pair of boy-crazy twin sisters who attend a high school in some sweet valley somewhere. And then there are the Hooper Quints, who, along with a wealthy heiress's priceless diamond necklace, have suddenly gone missing.<br /><br />Does it surprise you that the supposedly \"on vacation\" Katie, Jasper, and Lily are the only ones around who have the chops to solve this challenging mystery?<br /><br />National Book Award finalist M. T. Anderson has done it again with this second volume of his riotous and wonderfully weird new series.<br />",

    "description": "\"Sadly, death at the races is not uncommon. However, three in a single afternoon was sufficiently unusual to raise more than one eyebrow.\" <br /><br /> It's the third death on Cheltenham Gold Cup Day that really troubles super-sleuth Sid Halley. Last seen in 1995's <i>Come to Grief</i>, former champion jockey Halley knows the perils of racing all too well-but in his day, jockeys didn't usually reach the finishing line with three .38 rounds in the chest. But this is precisely how he finds jockey Huw Walker-who, only a few hours earlier, had won the coveted Triumph Hurdle. <br /><br /> Just moments before the gruesome discovery, Halley had been called upon by Lord Enstone to make discreet inquiries into why his horses appeared to be on a permanent losing streak. Are races being fixed? Are bookies taking a cut? And if so, are trainers and jockeys playing a dangerous game with stakes far higher than they are realistic? <br /><br /> Halley's quest for answers draws him even deeper into the darker side of the race game, in a life-or-death power play that will push him to his very limits-both professionally and personally.",

    "description": "Based on the conviction that only translators who write poetry themselves can properly recreate the celebrated Greek tragedies, the Greek Tragedy in New Translation series offers new translations that go beyond the literal meaning of the Greek in order to evoke the poetry of the originals. Under the general editorship of Peter Burian and Alan Shapiro, each volume includes a critical introduction, commentary on the text, full stage directions, and a glossary of the mythical and geographical references in the plays.<br />Brought boldly to life by Herbert Golder and Richard Pevear's translation and contextualized by Herbert Golder's eloquent introduction, this early Sophoclean tragedy tells the story of the Homeric hero better known as Ajax, who was second only to Achilles among the Greek warriors. In Greek tradition, Aias figures as the archaic warrior who dies in shame after his betrayal by the Greeks. Sophocles turns tradition inside out, portraying Aias' suicide not as a disgrace but as heroism. He endows Aias suicide with a meaning radically different from previous versions of the Aias myth--Aias is not the hero whom time has passed by, but rather the man who steps beyond time. Most previous versions and interpretations have equivocated over Sophocles' bold vision. This edition of Aias translates precisely that transformation of the hero from the bygone figure to the man who transcends time.<br />",

Discovering it's JFK, RFK &amp; MLK assassination studies, they follow memo trails suggesting secret society involvements. Meanwhile, a reporter visiting Texas is jailed for drug possession. The prison's bombed. He's dragged to a submarine representing Discordians who battle Illuminati who control the world. He finances operations by smuggling.<br /> The plot meanders to places like Las Vegas, where a government-mutated anthrax has been accidentally unleashed; Atlantis, home of a talking porpoise; Chicago, where someone resembling Dillinger was killed; &amp; Fernando Poo, location of the next standoff between China, the USA &amp; USSR.<br /> The plan is to immanentize the eschaton, a scheme of the AMA, a rock-&amp;-roll band, to inspire mass sacrifice to release energy to immortalize initiates. They're four siblings comprising four of the five Illuminati Primi. The 5th's identity is unknown. The 1st European Woodstock in Ingolstadt is chosen via the awakening of hibernating Nazis from Lake Totenkopf's bed. It's foiled when the band's killed with help from Goddess Eris.<br /> On the sub, the protagonists are menaced by a pyramidal cell that's grown for eons. They question whether they're in a book--a metafictional note rejected as they attend to Leviathon. It's neutralized by an onboard computer. Finally, one reveals himself as the 5th Illuminatus Primus\u2014toying with both sides in order to keep balance. He's a true Illuminatus, whose aim is to...",

But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard \"accidentally\" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. <p> As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>",

I made every effort to write them so that they could be read in any order. I am aware that, in some measure at least, I have failed (I certainly wouldn't recommend starting with <i>Teckla</i>, for example), but the fact that I was trying makes me incapable of giving an answer.\n    \n    Many people whose opinion I respect believe publication order is best . . . The choice, I daresay, is yours. In any case, I hope you enjoy them.\n    \n    --Steven Brust, 1999, in the notes for <i>The Book of Jhereg</i></blockquote>The books are numbered in publication order;  here is a rough guide to chronological order:\n    \n        Taltos (1988)\n        Dragon (1998)\n        Yendi (1984)\n        Tiassa, section 1 (2011)\n        Jhereg (1983)\n        Teckla (1987)\n        Phoenix (1990)\n        Jhegaala (2008)\n        Athyra (1993)\n        Orca (1996)\n        Issola (2001)\n        Dzur (2006)\n        Tiassa, section 2 (2011)\n        Iorich (2010)\n        Tiassa, section 3 (2011)\n    \n    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Brust\n    \n    http://us.macmillan.com/series/Vlad",

    "description": "Joyce and Marshall each think the other is killed on September 11\u2014and must swallow their disappointment when the other arrives home. As their bitter divorce is further complicated by anthrax scares, suicide bombs, and foreign wars, they suffer, in ways unexpectedly personal and increasingly ludicrous, the many strange ravages of our time. In this astonishing black comedy, Kalfus suggests how our nation\u2019s public calamities have encroached upon our most private illusions.",

But she feels that her life is empty until the moment she encounters the impetuous officer Count Vronsky. Their subsequent affair scandalizes society and family alike and soon brings jealously and bitterness in its wake. Contrasting with this tale of love and self-destruction is the vividly observed story of Levin, a man striving to find contentment and a meaning to his life - and also a self-portrait of Tolstoy himself.",

    "description": "Referring to Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, H. L. Mencken noted that his discovery of this classic American novel was \"the most stupendous event of my whole life\"; Ernest Hemingway declared that \"all modern American literature stems from this one book,\" while T. S. Eliot called Huck \"one of the permanent symbolic figures of fiction, not unworthy to take a place with Ulysses, Faust, Don Quixote, Don Juan, Hamlet.\"<br />The novel's preeminence derives from its wonderfully imaginative re-creation of boyhood adventures along the mighty Mississippi River, its inspired characterization, the author's remarkable ear for dialogue, and the book's understated development of serious underlying themes: \"natural\" man versus \"civilized\" society, the evils of slavery, the innate value and dignity of human beings, the stultifying effects of convention, and other topics. But most of all, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a wonderful story \u2015 filled with high adventure and unforgettable characters (including the great river itself) \u2015 that no one who has read it will ever forget.<br />Reprint of the Charles L. Webster and Company, New York, 1885 edition. New introductory Note.<br />Source: store.doverpublications.com",

    "description": "When it was first published, <em>Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art</em> changed the way the culinary world viewed Japanese cooking, moving it from obscure ethnic food to haute cuisine.<br /><br />Twenty-five years later, much has changed. Japanese food is a favorite of diners around the world. Not only is <em>sushi</em> as much a part of the Western culinary scene as burgers, bagels, and burritos, but some Japanese chefs have become household names. Japanese flavors, ingredients, and textures have been fused into dishes from a wide variety of other cuisines. What hasn't changed over the years, however, are the foundations of Japanese cooking. When he originally wrote <em>Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art</em>, Shizuo Tsuji, a scholar who trained under famous European chefs, was so careful and precise in his descriptions of the cuisine and its vital philosophies, and so thoughtful in his choice of dishes and recipes, that his words--and the dishes they help produce--are as fresh today as when they were first written.<br /> The 25th Anniversary edition celebrates Tsuji's classic work. Building on M.F.K.Fisher's eloquent introduction, the volume now includes a thought-provoking new Foreword by <em>Gourmet</em> Editor-in-Chief Ruth Reichl and a new preface by the author's son and Tsuji Culinary Institute Director Yoshiki Tsuji. Beautifully illustrated with eight pages of new color photos and over 500 drawings, and containing 230 traditional recipes as well as detailed explanations of ingredients, kitchen utensils, techniques and cultural aspects of Japanese cuisine, this edition continues the Tsuji legacy of bringing the Japanese kitchen within the reach of Western cooks.",

    "description": "This is the definitive, textually accurate edition of a classic of twentieth-century literature, The Great Gatsby. The story of the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan has been acclaimed by generations of readers. But the first edition contained a number of errors resulting from Fitzgerald's extensive revisions and a rushed production schedule. Subsequent printings introduced further departures from the author's words. This edition, based on the Cambridge critical text, restores all the language of Fitzgerald's masterpiece. Drawing on the manuscript and surviving proofs of the novel, along with Fitzgerald's later revisions and corrections, this is the authorized text -- The Great Gatsby as Fitzgerald intended it.",

Wizened emperors and upstart kings scheme and fight to secure a place in the world. Horrifying creatures lurk in and around civilized places. Lost treasures lie in darkness, awaiting rediscovery. \n    \n    The shadowy wizards of Netheril gather their power in the north. Countless undead muster to the east in the land of Thay. Ancient evil stirs to the south, where monsters rule. Across the sea, to the west, a continent that was once part of another world beckons with elemental glory. The denizens of the planes are restless in the realigned cosmic order. Old dynasties endure, and new ones gaze about with covetous eyes.",

Ancient evil stirs to the south, where monsters rule. Across the sea, to the west, a continent that was once part of another world beckons with elemental glory.

    "description": "Alex Garland's international bestseller, The Beach, received extraordinary praise, and his writing was compared to Hemingway, Greene, Conrad, Golding, and Huxley. His new novel, The Tesseract, is a bold departure from The Beach, and demonstrates the enormous range of Garland's talent.<br /><br />The Tesseract is a Chinese puzzle of a novel, beautifully written and suspensefully crafted. Set in the Philippines and spanning three generations, it follows three stories whose characters' fates are intertwined: gangsters on a chase through the streets of Manila; middle-class parents putting their children to bed in the suburbs; and a couple of street kids and the wealthy psychologist who is studying their dreams. It is a novel that balances science against religion, and our wills against our fates, asking the ever elusive question of where meaning lies.",

Nor do they. He seems to be having an affair with his secretary which is exciting, but unlikely. Further unsettled by leaps in logic and time, Carl wonders if he's actually reacting to the outside world, or if he's terribly mistaken. So begins a psychological adventure that stretches the boundaries of conciousness.",

    "description": "<b>Crossing the Unknown Sea</b> is about reuniting the imagination with our day to day lives. It shows how poetry and practicality, far from being mutually exclusive, reinforce each other to give every aspect of our lives meaning and direction. For anyone who wants to deepen their connection to their life\u2019s work<b>\u2014</b>or find out what their life\u2019s work is<b>\u2014</b>this book can help navigate the way.Whyte encourages readers to take risks at work that will enhance their personal growth, and shows how burnout can actually be beneficial and used to renew professional interest. He asserts that too many people blindly trudge through a mediocre work life because so many \u201cbusy\u201d tasks prevent significant reflection and analysis of job satisfaction. People often turn to spiritual practice or religion to nurture their souls, but overlook how work can actually be our greatest opportunity for discovery and growth. <b>Crossing the Unknown Sea</b> combines poetry, gifted storytelling and Whyte\u2019s personal experience to reveal work\u2019s potential to fulfill us and bring us closer to ultimate freedom and happiness.",

    "description": "When Jessica marries David, he is everything she wants in a family man: brilliant, attentive, ever youthful. Yet she still feels something about him is just out of reach. Soon, as people close to Jessica begin to meet violent, mysterious deaths, David makes an unimaginable confession: More than 400 years ago, he and other members of an Ethiopian sect traded their humanity so they would never die, a secret he must protect at any cost. Now, his immortal brethren have decided David must return and leave his family in Miami. Instead, David vows to invoke a forbidden ritual to keep Jessica and his daughter with him forever. Harrowing, engrossing and skillfully rendered, <em>My Soul to Keep</em> traps Jessica between the desperation of immortals who want to rob her of her life and a husband who wants to rob her of her soul. With deft plotting and an unforgettable climax, this tour de force reminiscent of early Anne Rice will win Due a new legion of fans.",

    "description": "Not so long ago Marcus Walker was just another young commodities trader in Chicago, working hard and playing harder. But that\u2019s all in the past, part of a life half forgotten\u2014a reality that vanished when he was attacked while camping and tossed aboard a starship bound for deep space.<br /><br />Desperately, Walker searches for explanations, only to realize he\u2019s trapped in a horrifying nightmare that is all too real. Instead of being a rich hotshot at the top of the food chain, Walker discovers he\u2019s just another amusing novelty, part of a cargo of \u201ccute\u201d aliens from primitive planets\u2014destined to be sold as pets to highly advanced populations in \u201ccivilized\u201d regions of the galaxy.<br /><br />Even if he weren\u2019t constantly watched by his captors, Walker has few options. After all, there is no escape from a speeding starship. Another man might resign himself to the inevitable and hope to be sold to a kindly owner, but not Walker. This former college football star has plenty of American ingenuity and no intention of admitting defeat, now or ever. In fact, he\u2019s only just begun to fight.",

    "description": "If you love the joys of eating home-garden vegetables but always thought those joys had to stop at the end of summer, this book is for you. Eliot Coleman introduces the surprising fact that most of the United States has more winter sunshine than the south of France. He shows how North American gardeners can successfully use that sun to raise a wide variety of traditional winter vegetables in backyard cold frames and plastic covered tunnel greenhouses without supplementary heat. Coleman expands upon his own experiences with new ideas learned on a winter-vegetable pilgrimage across the ocean to the acknowledged kingdom of vegetable cuisine, the southern part of France, which lies on the 44th parallel, the same latitude as his farm in Maine.<br /><br />This story of sunshine, weather patterns, old limitations and expectations, and new realities is delightfully innovative in the best gardening tradition. <em>Four-Season Harvest</em> will have you feasting on fresh produce from your garden all through the winter.<br /><br />To learn more about the possibility of a four-season farm, please visit Coleman's website <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fourseasonfarm.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.fourseasonfarm.com</a>.",

    "description": "For successful African-American businesswoman Zoe Reynard, finding the pleasure she wants, the way she wants it, is not worth the risk of losing everything she has: marriage to the man she has loved since childhood, a thriving company, three wonderful children. But Zoe feels helpless in the grip of an overpowering addiction...to sex. Finding a compassionate woman therapist to help her, Zoe finally summons the courage to tell her torrid story, a tale of guilt and desire as shocking as it is compelling. From the sensitive artist with whom she spends stolen hours on rumpled sheets to the rough and violent man who draws her toward destruction, Zoe is a woman desperately searching for fulfilment -- and something darker, deeper, and perhaps deadly. As her life spins out of control and her sexual escapades carry her toward a dangerous choice, Zoe is racing against time to uncover the source of her \"fatal attraction\" -- as chilling secrets tumble forth from the recesses of a woman's mind, and perilous temptations lead toward a climax that can threaten her sanity, her marriage...and her life.",

    "description": "'Globalisation' is the buzzword of the 1990s. VI Lenin's <i>Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism</i> was one of the first attempts to account for the increasing importance of the world market in the twentieth century. Originally published in 1916, <i>Imperialism</i> explains how colonialism and the First World War were inherent features of the global development of the capitalist economy.<br /><br />In a new introduction, Norman Lewis and James Malone contrast Lenin's approach with that adopted by contemporary theories of globalisation. They argue that, while much has changed since Lenin wrote, his theoretical framework remains the best method for understanding recent global developments.",

These young men become enthusiastic soldiers, but their world of duty, culture, and progress breaks into pieces under the first bombardment in the trenches. <br /><br />Through years of vivid horror, Paul holds fast to a single vow: to fight against the hatred that meaninglessly pits young men of the same generation but different uniforms against one another \u2013 if only he can come out of the war alive.",

    "description": "Although generations of readers of the Little House books are familiar with Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s early life up through her first years of marriage to Almanzo Wilder, few know about her adult years. Going beyond previous studies, <i>Becoming Laura Ingalls Wilder</i> focuses upon Wilder\u2019s years in Missouri from 1894 to 1957. Utilizing her unpublished autobiography, letters, newspaper stories, and other documentary evidence, John E. Miller fills the gaps in Wilder\u2019s autobiographical novels and describes her sixty-three years of living in Mansfield, Missouri. As a result, the process of personal development that culminated in Wilder\u2019s writing of the novels that secured her reputation as one of America\u2019s most popular children\u2019s authors becomes evident.",

    "description": "<div><p>In this captivating blend of culinary history and popular culture, the award-winning author of <b>Perfection Salad</b> shows us what happened when the food industry elbowed its way into the kitchen after World War II, brandishing canned hamburgers, frozen baked beans, and instant piecrusts. Big Business waged an all-out campaign to win the allegiance of American housewives, but most women were suspicious of the new foods\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the make-believe cooking they entailed. With sharp insight and good humor, Laura Shapiro shows how the ensuing battle helped shape the way we eat today, and how the clash in the kitchen reverberated elsewhere in the house as women struggled with marriage, work, and domesticity. This unconventional history overturns our notions about the \u201950s and offers new thinking on some of its fascinating figures, including Poppy Cannon, Shirley Jackson, Julia Child, and Betty Friedan.</p> </div>",

    "description": "A fascinating glimpse behind the big suits<br />and deadpan looks to the heart and soul of a band<br />that made it big by playing it cool With their minimalist beats, sophisticated lyrics, and stoic mien, the Talking Heads were indisputably one of the most influential and intriguing bands of their time. Rising from the ashes of punk and the smoldering embers of the disco inferno, they effectively straddled the boundaries between critical and commercial success as few other groups did, with music you could deconstruct and dance to at the same time.<br /><br />Culture critic David Bowman tells the fascinating story of how this brain trust of talented musicians turned pop music on its head. From the band's inception at the Rhode Island School of Design to their first big gig opening for the Ramones at CBGB, from their prominence in the worlds of art and fashion to the clash of egos and ideals that left them angry, jealous, and ready to call it quits, Bowman closely chronicles the rise and fall of a stunningly original and gloriously dysfunctional rock 'n' roll band that stayed together longer than anyone thought possible, and left a legacy that influences artists to this day.",

    "description": "Madame Bovary is the debut novel of French writer Gustave Flaubert, published in 1856. The character lives beyond her means in order to escape the banalities and emptiness of provincial life.<br /><br />When the novel was first serialized in La Revue de Paris between 1 October 1856 and 15 December 1856, public prosecutors attacked the novel for obscenity. The resulting trial in January 1857 made the story notorious. After Flaubert's acquittal on 7 February 1857, Madame Bovary became a bestseller in April 1857 when it was published in two volumes. A seminal work of literary realism, the novel is now considered Flaubert's masterpiece, and one of the most influential literary works in history.",

    "description": "<b>In late afternoon on November 7, 1985, sixteen-year-old Mary Veal was abducted after field hockey practice at her all-girls New England prep school.Or was she?</b><br /><br />A few weeks later an unharmed Mary reappears as suddenly and mysteriously as she disappeared, claiming to have little memory of what happened to her. Her socially ambitious mother, a compelling if frosty woman descended from a Salem witch, is concerned that Mary has somehow been sullied by the experience and sends her to therapy with a psychologist named Dr. Hammer. <br /><br />Mary turns out to be a cagey and difficult patient. Dr. Hammer begins to suspect that Mary concocted her tale of abduction when he discovers its parallels with a seventeenth-century narrative of a girl who was abducted by Indians and who caused her rescuer to be hanged as a witch. Hammer, eager to further his professional reputation, decides to write a book about Mary\u2019s faked abduction, a project her mother sanctions, because she'd rather her daughter be a liar than a rape victim. <br /><br />Fifteen years later, Mary has returned to Boston for her mother's funeral. Her abduction\u2014real or imagined\u2014has tainted many lives, including her own. When Mary finds a suggestive letter sent to her mother, she suspects her mother planned a reconciliation before her death. Thus begins a quest that requires Mary to revisit the people and places in her past.<br /><br /><i>The Uses of Enchantment </i>weaves a spell in which the reader sees how the extraordinary power of a young woman\u2019s sexuality, and the desire to wield it, have a devastating effect on all involved. The riveting cat-and-mouse power games between doctor and patient, and between abductor and abductee, are gradually, dreamily revealed, along with the truth about what actually happened in 1985. <br /><br />Heidi Julavits is in full command of her considerable gifts and has crafted a dazzling narrative sure to garner her further acclaim as one of the best novelists working today.",

His principles of theme park design, character design, and use of color have made him a legendary figure, not only for Disney fans but also for students and aficionados of architecture, engineering, and design. Designing Disney reveals the magic behind John's great discoveries and documents his groundbreaking work in several key areas, including the values, attitudes, aesthetics, and logic that went into the original design concepts for Disney theme parks. Hench details the essence and various meanings of colors and how they work in the parks, and lets the reader in on how and why of the Disney character's inherent popularity-their timeless human traits, archetypal shapes and gestures that suggest their qualities graphically, and their emotional resonance in our lives.",

Dr. Goffman uses the metaphor of theatrical performance as a framework. Each person in everyday social intercourse presents himself and his activity to others, attempts to guide and cotnrol the impressions they form of him, and employs certain techniques in order to sustain his performance, just as an actor presents a character to an audience. The discussions of these social techniques offered here are based upon detailed research and observation of social customs in many regions.",

    "description": "<i>The Last September</i> is Elizabeth Bowen's portrait of a young woman's coming of age in a brutalized time and place, where the ordinariness of life floats like music over the impending doom of history.<br /><br />In 1920, at their country home in County Cork, Sir Richard Naylor and his wife, Lady Myra, and their friends maintain a skeptical attitude toward the events going on around them, but behind the facade of tennis parties and army camp dances, all know that the end is approaching\u2014the end of British rule in the south of Ireland and the demise of a way of life that had survived for centuries. Their niece, Lois Farquar, attempts to live her own life and gain her own freedoms from the very class that her elders are vainly defending. <i>The Last September</i> depicts the tensions between love and the longing for freedom, between tradition and the terrifying prospect of independence, both political and spiritual.",

    "description": "A fiercely poetic literary debut re-creating the life of an 19th-century slave woman in South Africa.<br /><br />Slavery as it existed in Africa has seldom been portrayed\u2014and never with such texture, detail, and authentic emotion. Inspired by actual 19th-century court records, Unconfessed is a breathtaking literary tour de force. They called her Sila van den Kaap, slave woman of Jacobus Stephanus Van der Wat of Plettenberg Bay, South Africa. A woman moved from master to master, farm to farm, and\u2014driven by the horrors of slavery to commit an unspeakable crime\u2014from prison to prison. A woman fit for hanging . . . condemned to death on April 30, 1823, but whose sentence the English, having recently wrested authority from the Dutch settlers, saw fit to commute to a lengthy term on the notorious Robben Island. <br /><br />Sila spends her days in the prison quarry, breaking stones for Cape Town\u2019s streets and walls. She remembers the day her childhood ended, when slave catchers came \u201cwhipping the air and the ground and we were like deer whipped into the smaller and smaller circle of our fear.\u201d Sila remembers her masters, especially Oumiesies (\u201cold Missus\u201d), who in her will granted Sila her freedom, but Theron, Oumiesies\u2019 vicious and mercenary son, destroys the will and with it Sila\u2019s life. Sila remembers her children, with joy and with pain, and imagines herself a great bird that could sweep them up in her wings and set them safely on a branch above all harm. Unconfessed is an epic novel that connects the reader to the unimaginable through the force of poetry and a far-reaching imagination.",

    "description": "<i>\u201cI am a changeling\u2013a word that describes within its own name what we are bound and intended to do. We kidnap a human child and replace him or her with one of our own. . . .\u201d</i>The double story of Henry Day begins in 1949, when he is kidnapped at age seven by a band of wild childlike beings who live in an ancient, secret community in the forest. The changelings rename their captive Aniday and he becomes, like them, unaging and stuck in time. They leave one of their own to take his place, an imposter who must try\u2013with varying success\u2013to hide his true identity from the Day family. As the changeling Henry grows up, he is haunted by glimpses of his lost double and by vague memories of his own childhood a century earlier. Narrated in turns by Henry and Aniday, <i>The Stolen Child </i>follows them as their lives converge, driven by their obsessive search for who they were before they changed places in the world. Moving from a realistic setting in small-town America deep into the forest of humankind\u2019s most basic desires and fears, this remarkable novel is a haunting fable about identity and the illusory innocence of childhood.",

    "description": "On one level, <i>An American Tragedy</i> is the story of the corruption and destruction of one man, Clyde Griffiths, who forfeits his life in desperate pursuit of success. On a deeper, more profound level, the novel represents a massive portrayal of the society whose values both shape Clyde's tawdry ambitions and seal his fate: It is an unsurpassed depiction of the harsh realities of American life and of the dark side of the American Dream. Extraordinary in scope and power, vivid in its sense of wholesale human waste, unceasing in its rich compassion, <i>An American Tragedy</i> stands as Theodore Dreiser's supreme achievement.<br /><br />Based on an actual crime case, <i>An American Tragedy</i> was the inspiration for the film <i>A Place in the Sun</i>, winner of six Academy Awards, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift.",

    "description": "Justly celebrated at home and abroad, Robert Frost is perhaps America\u2019s greatest twentieth-century poet and a towering figure in American letters. From the publication of his first collections, <em>A Boy\u2019s Will</em> (1913) and <em>North of Boston</em> (1914), Frost was recognized as a poet of unique power and formal skill, and the enduring significance of his work has been acknowledged by each subsequent generation. His poetry ranges from deceptively simply pastoral lyrics and genial, vernacular genre pieces to darker meditations, complex and ironic.<br /><br />Here, based on extensive research into his manuscripts and published work, is the first authoritative and truly comprehensive collection of his writings. Brought together for the first time in a <em>Library of America</em> single volume is all the major poetry, a generous selection of uncollected poems, all of Frost\u2019s dramatic writing, and the most extensive gathering of his prose writings ever published, several of which are printed here for the first time.<br /><br />The core of this collection is the 1949 <em>Complete Poems of Robert Frost</em>, the last collection supervised by Frost himself. This version of the poems is free of unauthorized editorial changes introduced into subsequent editions. Also included is <em>In the Clearing</em> (1962), Frost\u2019s final volume of poetry. Verse drawn from letters, articles, pamphlets, and journals makes up the largest selection of uncollected poems ever assembled, including nearly two dozen beautiful early works printed for the first time. Also gathered here are all the dramatic works: three plays and two verse masques.<br /><br />The unprecedented prose section includes more than three times as many items as any other collection available. It is rich and diverse, presenting many newly discovered or rediscovered pieces. Especially unusual items include Frost\u2019s contribution to John F. Kennedy\u2019s inauguration and two fascinating 1959 essays on \u201cThe Future of Man.\u201d Several manuscript items are published here for the first time, including the essays \u201c\u2018Caveat Poeta\u2019\u201d and \u201cThe Way There,\u201d Frost\u2019s remarks on being appointed poetry consultant to the Library of Congress in 1958, the preface to a proposed new edition of <em>North of Boston</em>, and many others. A selection of letters represents all of Frost\u2019s important comments about prosody, poetics, style, and his theory of \u201csentence sounds.\u201d",

    "description": "In the haunting tradition of Joe McGinniss's <em>Fatal Vision</em> and Mikal Gilmore's <em>Shot in the Heart</em>, <strong>True Story: Murder, Memoir, Mea Culpa</strong> weaves a spellbinding tale of murder, love, and deceit with a deeply personal inquiry into the slippery nature of truth.<br /><br />The story begins in February of 2002, when a reporter in Oregon contacts <em>New York Times Magazine</em> writer Michael Finkel with a startling piece of news. A young, highly intelligent man named Christian Longo, on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list for killing his entire family, has recently been captured in Mexico, where he'd taken on a new identity -- Michael Finkel of the <em>New York Times</em>.<br /><br />The next day, on page A-3 of the <em>Times</em>, comes another bit of troubling news: a note, written by the paper's editors, explaining that Finkel has falsified parts of an investigative article and has been fired. This unlikely confluence sets the stage for a bizarre and intense relationship. After Longo's arrest, the only journalist the accused murderer will speak with is the real Michael Finkel. And as the months until Longo's trial tick away, the two men talk for dozens of hours on the telephone, meet in the jailhouse visiting room, and exchange nearly a thousand pages of handwritten letters.<br /><br />With Longo insisting he can prove his innocence, Finkel strives to uncover what really happened to Longo's family, and his quest becomes less a reporting job than a psychological cat-and-mouse game -- sometimes redemptively honest, other times slyly manipulative. Finkel's pursuit pays off only at the end, when Longo, after a lifetime of deception, finally says what he wouldn't even admit in court -- the whole, true story. Or so it seems.",

The authors, both distinguished scholars, revisit the historical roots of American religious freedom, paying particular attention to such figures as John Locke, Roger Williams, and especially Thomas Jefferson, and examine the controversies, up to the present day, over the proper place of religion in our political life. With a new chapter that explores the role of religion in the public life of George W. Bush's America, <em>The Godless Constitution</em> offers a bracing return to the first principles of American governance.",

    "description": "Once, Redmond Hatch was in heaven, married to the lovely Catherine and father to enchanting daughter Immy. But then he took them both to Winterwood. And it would never be the same again\u2026<br /><br />In Patrick McCabe's spellbinding new novel, nothing\u2014and no one\u2014are ever quite what they seem. When Hatch, devoted husband and father, revisits the secluded mountains where he grew up, he meets Auld Pappie Ned. While he claims to be just a harmless local fiddler, a teller of tall tales, Ned sets off a cataclysmic chain of events in Redmond's life. From the mysterious disappearance of Redmond's daughter to the reluctant remembrance of a troubled boyhood to secret glimpses into an unstable marriage, everything soon spirals out of control. Narrated with hypnotic precision and fractured lyricism, <i>Winterwood</i> is a disturbing and unforgettable tale of love, death and identity from a masterful novelist.",

Set in Ireland in the 1880s against a backdrop of Land League troubles in Co.

    "description": "With daring realism and stunning imagination, the author of <i>Geek Love</i>, Katherine Dunn, takes us on a journey into the mind of a feisty, adventurous adolescent named Jean \"Dutch\" Gillis. Dutch goes \"trucking\" from Portland, Oregon, to Los Angeles on a quest in search of herself, which, like the river trek of <i>Deliverance</i>, is filled with discoveries and sudden violence.<br /><br />With boyish-looking Dutch is her friend Heydorf, a shadowy character who has his own secrets to hide. With her, too, is the confusion and volatile feelings of youth, when sex is a mystery waiting to be understood...and death seems remote until it brushes close with a breath-stopping suddenness. <i>Truck</i>, perhaps better than any other fictional account about a runaway, is a brilliantly convincing portrait of the archetypal teen rebel, and both the excitement and the terrible betrayals in the world she explores.",

    "description": "At last! A zesty, exuberant follow-up to the wildly popular How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents, full of Julia Alvarez's keen observations and tender affection for her characters.<br /><br />The Garcia Girls are back, most notably Yolanda, or Yo, who has grown up to be a writer. In the process, she has managed to get kicked out of college, break more than a few hearts, have her own heart broken many times, return for extended visits to the Dominican Republic her family fled when she was a child, and marry three times. She has also infuriated her entire family by publishing the intimate details of their lives as fiction.<br /><br />This brilliant novel is a full and true exploration of a woman's soul, a meditation on the writing life, and a lyrical account of the immigrant's search for identity and a place in the world. !Yo!'s bright colors, zesty dialogue, warm feeling, and genuine insight could only come from the palette of Julia Alvarez.<br /><br />Description from Penguin Group.",

As the story begins, Isabel, resolved to determine her own fate, has turned down two eligible suitors. Her cousin, who is dying of tuberculosis, secretly gives her an inheritance so that she can remain independent and fulfill a grand destiny, but the fortune only leads her to make a tragic choice and marry Gilbert Osmond, an American expatriate who lives in Florence. Outwardly charming and cultivated, but fundamentally cold and cruel, Osmond only brings heartbreak and ruin to Isabel\u2019s life. Yet she survives as she begins to realize that true freedom means living with her choices and their consequences. Richly complex and nearly aesthetically perfect, The Portrait of a Lady brilliantly portrays the clash between the innocence and exuberance of the New World and the corruption and wisdom of the Old.",

    "description": "Set in colonial India during the 1920s, Heat and Dust tells the story of Olivia, a beautiful woman suffocated by the propriety and social constraints of her position as the wife of an important English civil servant. Longing for passion and independence, Olivia is drawn into the spell of the Nawab, a minor Indian prince deeply involved in gang raids and criminal plots. She is intrigued by the Nawab's charm and aggressive courtship, and soon begins to spend most of her days in his company. But then she becomes pregnant, and unsure of the child's paternity, she is faced with a wrenching dilemma. Her reaction to the crisis humiliates her husband and outrages the British community, breeding a scandal that lives in collective memory long after her death.",

A culinary compendium packed with more than 200 foolproof recipes for the best baked goods, <i>Martha Stewart s Baking Handbook </i>takes readers by the hand and guides them through the process of creating an irresistible variety of cakes, cookies, pies, tarts, breads, and much more. <br />This essential addition to every cook s library is rich with tips, techniques, and the mouthwatering and stunning recipes for which Martha Stewart is so well known. Covering a delectable array of topics from simple to sophisticated, including biscuits, muffins, scones, cookies, layer cakes, specialty cakes, sweet and savory pies and tarts, and pastries and breads, she provides a dazzlingly delicious yet crystal-clear, vividly illustrated repertoire of recipes. There are cakes that are elegant enough for formal occasions, such as showers, weddings, and dinner parties, and basic favorites meant to be enjoyed every day and then passed down through the generations. Every chapter includes indispensable visual equipment glossaries and features vital make-ahead information and storage techniques. Organized for maximum clarity and practicality, the handbook also offers step-by-step how-to photographs that demystify even the most complex and nuanced techniques. These culinary building blocks will turn good bakers into great bakers, and make great bakers even better. <br />Filled with time-honored classics, such as Marble Cake with White-Chocolate Glaze, Apple Pie, Challah, Baba au Rhum, and Croissants, as well as lots of new surprises, <i> Martha Stewart s Baking Handbook</i> will be reached for again and again, no matter the season or occasion. Here, you will find the recipes and how-tos for the popovers you dream about, and for the simple crumb cake that you always want to whip up on Sunday morning, and for the double-chocolate brownie cookies that will make you a bigger hero with the after-school crowd, and for the citrus bars that you could only find in that little bakery that s no longer under the same management. . . . Baking offers comfort and joy and something tangible to taste and savor. We all hope that these recipes provide you with years of pleasure. <b> Martha Stewart</b>\"",

    "description": "Clear-eyed and spirited, Taylor Greer grew up poor in rural Kentucky with the goals of avoiding pregnancy and getting away. But when she heads west with high hopes and a barely functional car, she meets the human condition head-on. By the time Taylor arrives in Tucson, Arizona, she has acquired a completely unexpected child, a three-year-old American Indian girl named Turtle, and must somehow come to terms with both motherhood and the necessity for putting down roots. Hers is a story about love and friendship, abandonment and belonging, and the discovery of surprising resources in apparently empty places.<br /><br />Available for the first time in mass-market, this edition of Barbara Kingsolver's bestselling novel, <em>The Bean Trees,</em> will be in stores everywhere in September. With two different but equally handsome covers, this book is a fine addition to your Kingsolver library.",

But when Kathryn Lyons receives word that a plane flown by her husband, Jack, has exploded near the coast of Ireland, she confronts the unfathomable-one startling revelation at a time. Soon drawn into a maelstrom of publicity fueled by rumors that Jack led a secret life, Kathryn sets out to learn who her husband really was, whatever that knowledge might cost. Her search propels this taut, impassioned novel as it movingly explores the question, How well can we ever really know another person?",

Fleeing from Beirut in search of solace, Zahra stays with her uncle in West Africa\u2014and then uses marriage as another kind of escape. Back in Beirut, love finally comes to her, but with terrible consequences. Banned in several Middle Eastern countries since its original publication, The Story of Zahra is an intoxicating, provocative story of a young woman\u2019s coming of age in a city torn apart by war.<br /><br />With more than 21,000 copies in print of \"Women Of Sand And Myrrh,\" and more than 15,000 copies of \"The Story Of Zahra,\" Hanan al-Shaykh is the best known and most admired woman writer of the Arab world. The paperback publication of \"Zahra\" will bring this passionate and courageous novel to a much larger group of readers. Its haunting story of a young Lebanese woman who attempts to stem the violence in Beirut by initiating a sexual liaison with a sniper has \"lifted the corner of a dark curtain\" ( \"Sunday Telegraph\" ) from a world that fascinates us all.\" \"The Story Of Zahra\" is a classic by any standards.\"-- \"Village Voice Literary Supplement.\"<br /><br />\"This rich tale mesmerizes with its frank sexuality and scenes of war-torn Beirut.\"-- \"Publishers Weekly.\"",

    "description": "It's been nearly four decades since Carl Sagan first addressed the general public from a scientist's perspective, confronting the possibility of extraterrestrial life. David Grinspoon, a planetary scientist who has helped to shape modern planetary exploration, brings the subject to a new generation of readers with his reflections on the most recent developments in astrobiology, including NASA's search for life on Mars. In <em>Lonely Planets</em>, he investigates the big questions: How widespread are life and intelligence in the cosmos? Is life on Earth an accident or in some sense the \"purpose\" of this universe? And how can we, working from the Earth-centric definition of \"life,\" even begin to think about the varieties of life-forms on other planets?<br /><br />Using the topic of extraterrestrial life as a mirror with which to view human beliefs, evolution, history, and aspirations, Grinspoon provides an authoritative scientific narrative of cosmic evolution, along with provocative ruminations on how we fit into the story of the universe. An accessible, lively blend of science, history, philosophy, and personal narrative, <em>Lonely Planets</em> reveals how the search for extraterrestrial life unites our spiritual and scientific quests for connection with the cosmos.",

From the outside, Zephyr is just another bland corporate monolith, but behind its glass doors business is far from usual: the beautiful receptionist is paid twice as much as anybody else to do nothing, the sales reps use self help books as manuals, no one has seen the CEO, no one knows exactly what they are selling, and missing donuts are the cause of office intrigue. While Jones originally wanted to climb the corporate ladder, he now finds himself descending deeper into the irrational rationality of company policy. What he finds is hilarious, shocking, and utterly telling.",

    "description": "Before the <em>X-Files,</em> before alt.conspiracy, there was Robert Anton Wilson and his legendary <em>Illuminatus! Trilogy.</em> Now this avatar of conspiriology, renowned for his razor wit and progressive philosophy, takes you on a fascinating, eclectic ride through what Wilson has termed the \"Cultic Twilight\" where conspiracy theories flourish. <em>Everything Is Under Control</em> covers the range of Wilson's kaleidoscopic knowledge, from John Adams to the Voronezh (former Soviet Union) UFO sighting, the Campus Crusade for Cthulhu to the Mothman prophecies, and everything in between. What do the Freemasons, the Kennedys, and Princess Diana have in common? All are at the center of gigantic conspiracy theories with incredibly complex and endlessly multiplying twists, turns, highways and byways. Arranged by alphabetical entries which include cross-references to other entries in the book and also provide addresses to related sites on the Web, this book is truly interactive \u2014 you can dip in, read through, or follow one of the URLs from an interesting entry onto the internet.<br /><br />What some famous people say about Robert Anton Wilson:<br /><blockquote>\"A dazzling barker hawking tickets to the most thrilling tilt-a-whirls and daring loop-o-planes on the midway to higher consciousness.\"<br />--Tom Robbins<br />\"Wilson managed to reverse every mental polarity in me, as if I had been pulled through infinity.\"<br />\u2014Philip K. Dick<br />\"One of the most important scientific philosophers of his century \u2014 scholarly, witty, scientific, hip and hopeful.\"<br />\u2014Dr. Timothy Leary</blockquote>",
