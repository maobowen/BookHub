    "description": "Following his blood-curdling adventures in <i>A Living Nightmare</i> and <i>The Vampire's Assistant</i>, half-vampire Darren Shan is settling into his day-to-day life at Cirque Du Freak, the traveling freak show he has joined. But before he can get too cozy, his vampire master, Mr. Crepsley, whisks him off to the big city for a mysterious mission. Soon, Crepsley, Darren, and Evra the snake-boy are embroiled in a bloody battle of wits between the vampire community and a mad, \"vampaneze,\" a creature from a separate, more murderous race of vampires. Along the way, Darren meets his first girlfriend, and winds up putting her life, as well as everyone else's, in grave danger.<p> The latest installment of Darren Shan's bestselling saga will surely satiate his legions of bloodthirsty fans. As fast-paced and thrilling as ever, his writing will encourage even reluctant readers to devour the series. Luckily for all, it looks as though we haven't seen the last of this appealing, well-meaning (if occasionally bumbling) half-vampire. (Ages 10 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>",

Martin comes the ultimate novel of revolution, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, and apocalyptic murder\u2014a stunning work of fiction that portrays not just the end of an era, but the end of the world as we know it.<br /><br />Onetime underground journalist Sandy Blair has come a long way from his radical roots in the \u201960s\u2014until something unexpectedly draws him back: the bizarre and brutal murder of a rock promoter who made millions with a band called the Nazg\u00fbl. Now, as Sandy sets out to investigate the crime, he finds himself drawn back into his own past\u2014a magical mystery tour of the pent-up passions of his generation. For a new messiah has resurrected the Nazg\u00fbl and the mad new rhythm may be more than anyone bargained for\u2014a requiem of demonism, mind control, and death, whose apocalyptic tune only Sandy may be able to change in time . . . before everyone follows the beat.",

    "description": "<em>Enough Rope</em>, a collection of superb stories, establishes the extraordinary skill, power, and versatility of contemporary Grand Master Lawrence Block.<br /><br />Block's beloved series characters are on hand, including ex-cop Matt Scudder, bookselling burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr, and the disarming duo of Chip Harrison and Leo Haig. Here, too, are Keller, the wistful hit man, and the natty attorney Martin Ehrengraf. Keeping them company are dozens of other refugees from Block's dazzling imagination, all caught up in more ingenious plots than you can shake a blunt instrument at.<br /><br />Half a dozen of Block's stories have been short-listed for the Edgar Award, and three have won it outright. All the tales in Block's three previous collections are here, along with two dozen new stories. Some will keep you on the edge of the chair. Others will make you roll on the floor laughing. <em>Enough Rope</em> is an essential volume for Lawrence Block fans, and a dazzling introduction for others to the wonderful world of Block magic!",

A psychologist who claims to believe the convict spends hours with the man in his death row cell, and ultimately watches in the gallery as the lethal injection is administered. His work completed, the psychologist heads back to New York City to attend to unfinished business.\" <br /><br />Meanwhile, Matthew Scudder has just agreed to investigate the ostensibly suspicious online lover of an acquaintance. It seems simple enough. At first. But when people start dying and the victims are increasingly closer to home, it becomes clear that a vicious killer is at work. And the final targets may be Matt and Elaine Scudder.",

    "description": "Alice Verney is a young woman intent on achieving her dreams. Having left Restoration England in the midst of a messy scandal, she has been living in Louis XIV\u2019s Baroque, mannered France for two years. Now she is returning home to England and anxious to re-establish herself quickly. First, she will regain her former position as a maid of honor to Charles II\u2019s queen. Then she will marry the most celebrated duke of the Restoration, putting herself in a position to attain power she\u2019s only dreamed of. As a duchess, Alice will be able to make or break her friends and enemies at will. <br /><br />But all is not as it seems in the rowdy, merry court of Charles II. Since the Restoration, old political alliances have frayed, and there are whispers that the king is moving to divorce his barren queen, who some wouldn\u2019t mind seeing dead. But Alice, loyal only to a select few, is devoted to the queen, and so sets out to discover who might be making sinister plans, and if her own father is one of them. When a member of the royal family dies unexpectedly, and poison is suspected, the stakes are raised. Alice steps up her efforts to find out who is and isn\u2019t true to the queen, learns of shocking betrayals throughout court, and meets a man that she may be falling in love with\u2014and who will spoil all of her plans. With the suspected arrival of a known poison-maker, the atmosphere in the court electrifies, and suddenly the safety of the king himself seems uncertain. Secret plots are at play, and war is on the horizon\u2014but will it be with the Dutch or the French? And has King Charles himself betrayed his country for greed? <br /><br />The long-awaited prequel to Koen\u2019s beloved <i>Through a Glass Darkly</i>, <i>Dark Angels</i> is a feast of a novel that sparkles with all the passion, extravagance, danger, and scandal of seventeenth-century England. Unforgettable in its dramatic force, here is a novel of love and politics, of romance and betrayal, of power and succession\u2014and of a resourceful young woman who risks everything for pride and status in an era in which women were afforded little of either.",

    "description": "This stunning debut novel tells the story of a biblical struggle in a remote Jamaican village in 1957. With language as taut as classic works by Cormac McCarthy, and a richness reminiscent of early Toni Morrison, Marlon James reveals his unique narrative command that will firmly establish his place as one of today's freshest, most talented young writers.<br /><br />In the village of Gibbeah--where certain women fly and certain men protect secrets with their lives--magic coexists with religion, and good and evil are never as they seem. In this town, a battle is fought between two men of God. The story begins when a drunkard named Hector Bligh (the \"Rum Preacher\") is dragged from his pulpit by a man calling himself \"Apostle\" York. Handsome and brash, York demands a fire-and-brimstone church, but sets in motion a phenomenal and deadly struggle for the soul of Gibbeah itself. <i>John Crow's Devil</i> is a novel about religious mania, redemption, sexual obsession, and the eternal struggle inside all of us between the righteous and the wicked.<br />",

    "description": "When the <i>Oceanic</i> sets sail from England's Port of Southampton, its ultimate destination is New York. But it must make one very important stop first: at Cherbourg, in France, to pick up internationally renowned financier and art collector J. P. Morgan, fresh from a continental buying spree sure to have turned up numerous priceless objets d'art.<br /><br />Needless to say, George Porter Dillman and Genevieve Masefield, ship's detectives aboard the <i>Oceanic,</i> are slightly nervous about the presence of such an important passenger, not to mention his valuable cargo, among the passengers. For in their five years as detectives aboard the most elegant, regal sailing ships of their time, the two sleuths have never known a transatlantic voyage to pass without incident.<br /><br />Also on board are a recently engaged couple, a charming rake who seems set on breaking them apart as well as seducing Genevieve, a controversial painter of nudes traveling with his bohemian wife and his alluring French model, and a pair of cabin stewards who have exclusive access to the private lairs of all aboard.<br /><br />The latest shipboard tale from master of mystery Conrad Allen is certain to sail right into the hearts of the many fans of this delightful series.<br />",

    "description": "From the bestselling social commentator and cultural historian, a fascinating exploration of one of humanity's oldest traditions: the celebration of communal joy<br />In the acclaimed \"Blood Rites,\" Barbara Ehrenreich delved into the origins of our species' attraction to war. Here, she explores the opposite impulse, one that has been so effectively suppressed that we lack even a term for it: the desire for collective joy, historically expressed in ecstatic revels of feasting, costuming, and dancing.<br />Ehrenreich uncovers the origins of communal celebration in human biology and culture. Although sixteenth-century Europeans viewed mass festivities as foreign and \"savage,\" Ehrenreich shows that they were indigenous to the West, from the ancient Greeks' worship of Dionysus to the medieval practice of Christianity as a \"danced religion.\" Ultimately, church officials drove the festivities into the streets, the prelude to widespread reformation: Protestants criminalized carnival, Wahhabist Muslims battled ecstatic Sufism, European colonizers wiped out native dance rites. The elites' fear that such gatherings would undermine social hierarchies was justified: the festive tradition inspired French revolutionary crowds and uprisings from the Caribbean to the American plains. Yet outbreaks of group revelry persist, as Ehrenreich shows, pointing to the 1960s rock-and-roll rebellion and the more recent \"carnivalization\" of sports. <br />Original, exhilarating, and deeply optimistic, \"Dancing in the Streets\" concludes that we are innately social beings, impelled to share our joy and therefore able to envision, even create, a more peaceable future.",

    "description": "A stunning and provocative new novel by the internationally celebrated author of The Blind Assassin, winner of the Booker Prize Margaret Atwood's new novel is so utterly compelling, so prescient, so relevant, so terrifyingly-all-too-likely-to-be-true, that readers may find their view of the world forever changed after reading it. This is Margaret Atwood at the absolute peak of her powers. For readers of Oryx and Crake, nothing will ever look the same again. The narrator of Atwood's riveting novel calls himself Snowman. When the story opens, he is sleeping in a tree, wearing an old bedsheet, mourning the loss of his beloved Oryx and his best friend Crake, and slowly starving to death. He searches for supplies in a wasteland where insects proliferate and pigoons and wolvogs ravage the pleeblands, where ordinary people once lived, and the Compounds that sheltered the extraordinary. As he tries to piece together what has taken place, the narrative shifts to decades earlier. How did everything fall apart so quickly? Why is he left with nothing but his haunting memories? Alone except for the green-eyed Children of Crake, who think of him as a kind of monster, he explores the answers to these questions in the double journey he takes - into his own past, and back to Crake's high-tech bubble-dome, where the Paradice Project unfolded and the world came to grief. With breathtaking command of her shocking material, and with her customary sharp wit and dark humour, Atwood projects us into an outlandish yet wholly believable realm populated by characters who will continue to inhabit our dreams long after the last chapter. This is Margaret Atwood at the absolute peak of her powers. From the Hardcover edition.",

    "description": "One of the last works completed by Isak Dinesen before her recent death, <i>Ehrengard</i> belongs to her Gothic Tales, in her own words \"fairy tales with dark shadows\". It is concerned \u2013 on one level \u2013 with the dynastic complications of a small but turbulent duchy, and the provision of an heir to the house of Fugger-Babenhausen. Ehrengard is the young Valkyrie who is drawn steadily deeper into an unwanted role in the intrigue, her powerful but only half-awakened nature subjected to appalling conflicts of loyalty, but not overwhelmed.<br /><br />Disquieting, clairvoyant, and with a faint, bewitching humour, this is creative writing of intense originality.<br /><br />-from jacket of first edition 1963",

    "description": "Sir Edward Feathers has had a brilliant career, from his early days as a lawyer in Southeast Asia, where he earned the nickname Old Filth (FILTH being an acronym for Failed In London Try Hong Kong) to his final working days as a respected judge at the English bar. Yet through it all he has carried with him the wounds of a difficult and emotionally hollow childhood. Now an eighty-year-old widower living in comfortable seclusion in Dorset, Feathers is finally free from the regimen of work and the sentimental scaffolding that has sustained him throughout his life. He slips back into the past with ever mounting frequency and intensity, and on the tide of these vivid, lyrical musings, Feathers approaches a reckoning with his own history. Not all the old filth, it seems, can be cleaned away.<br /><br />Borrowing from biography and history, Jane Gardam has written a literary masterpiece reminiscent of Rudyard Kipling's <i>Baa Baa, Black Sheep</i> that retraces much of the twentieth century's torrid and momentous history. Feathers' childhood in Malaya during the British Empire's heyday, his schooling in pre-war England, his professional success in Southeast Asia and his return to England toward the end of the millennium, are vantage points from which the reader can observe the march forward of an eventful era and the steady progress of that man, Sir Edward Feathers, Old Filth himself, who embodies the century's fate.<br /><br /><p>Old Filth was nominated for the 2005 Orange Prize.<br /></p>",

From Europa Books: Emotionally distant but highly successful Edward Feathers, his beautiful wife Betty, and his devilishly handsome professional rival (and Betty\u2019s one-time lover) Edward Veneering are the anchors of this series, with each novel focusing on a different character. Feathers was a \u201craj orphan\u201d\u2014children born in Far East British colonies and raised in England\u2014while Veneering\u2019s own path to legal renown is as Dickensian as his name. Filth and his circle tell a bittersweet tale of enduring friendship while contending with the disappointments and consolations of age as a once-insurmountable empire declines around them. Told with Jane Gardam\u2019s customary wit, the Old Filth trilogy is a deeply humane and often comic portrait of aging and a reminder that the experiences we choose to take with us in our twilight years are as unforgettable\u2014and unpredictable\u2014as life itself.",

Un Lun Dun is a place where words are alive, a jungle lurks behind the door of an ordinary house, carnivorous giraffes stalk the streets, and a dark cloud dreams of burning the world. It is a city awaiting its hero, whose coming was prophesied long ago, set down for all time in the pages of a talking book.<br /><br /> When twelve-year-old Zanna and her friend Deeba find a secret entrance leading out of London and into this strange city, it seems that the ancient prophecy is coming true at last. But then things begin to go shockingly wrong.",

    "description": "An English boy born in early-twentieth-century Shanghai, is orphaned at age nine when his mother and father both vanish under suspicious circumstances. Sent to live in England, he grows up to become a renowned detective and, 20 years later, returns to Shanghai, where the Sino-Japanese War is raging.<br /><br />The maze of human memory--the ways in which we accommodate and alter it, deceive and deliver ourselves with it--is territory that Kazuo Ishiguro has made his own. In his previous novels, he has explored this inner world and its manifestations in the lives of his characters with rare inventiveness and subtlety, shrewd humor and insight. In When We Were Orphans, his first novel in five years, he returns to this terrain in a brilliantly realized story that illuminates the power of one's past to determine the present.<br /><br />Christopher Banks, an English boy born in early-twentieth-century Shanghai, is orphaned at age nine when his mother and father both vanish under suspicious circumstances. Sent to live in England, he grows up to become a renowned detective and, more than twenty years later, returns to Shanghai, where the Sino-Japanese War is raging, to solve the mystery of the disappearances.<br /><br />The story is straightforward. Its telling is remarkable. Christopher's voice is controlled, detailed, and detached, its precision unsurprising in someone who has devoted his life to the examination of details and the rigors of objective thought. But within the layers of his narrative is slowly revealed what he can't, or won't, see: that his memory, despite what he wants to believe, is not unaffected by his childhood tragedies; that his powers of perception, the heralded clarity of his vision, can be blinding as well as enlightening; and that the simplest desires--a child's for his parents, a man's for understanding--may give rise to the most complicated truths.<br /><br />A masterful combination of narrative control and soaring imagination, When We Were Orphans is Kazuo Ishiguro at his best.",

Retreating into the past, she finds herself reliving one particular hot summer in Nagasaki, when she and her friends struggled to rebuild their lives after the war. But then as she recalls her strange friendship with Sachiko - a wealthy woman reduced to vagrancy - the memories take on a disturbing cast.",

    "description": "A Civil Action is a non-fiction book by Jonathan Harr about a water contamination case in Woburn, Massachusetts, in the 1980s. <br /><br />After finding that her child is diagnosed with leukemia, Anne Anderson notices a high prevalence of leukemia, a relatively rare disease, in her city. Eventually she gathers other families and seeks a lawyer, Jan Schlichtmann, to consider their options.<br /><br />Schlichtmann originally decides not to take the case due to both the lack of evidence and a clear defendant. Later picking up the case, Schlichtmann finds evidence suggesting trichloroethylene (TCE) contamination of the town's water supply by Riley Tannery, a subsidiary of Beatrice Foods; a chemical company, W. R. Grace; and another company named Unifirst.<br /><br />In the course of the lawsuit Schlichtmann gets other attorneys to assist him. He spends lavishly as he had in his prior lawsuits, but the length of the discovery process and trial stretch all of their assets to their limit.",

    "description": "Transcendent stories: about the uncertain gestures of love, about the betrayals and gifts of the body, about the surprises and bounties of the heart, and about what comes to us unbidden and what we choose.<br /><br />A great short story has the emotional depth and intensity of a poem and the wholeness and breadth of a novel. Amy Bloom writes great short stories. Her first collection, Come to Me, was a finalist for the National Book Award, and here she deepens and extends her mastery of the form.<br /><br />Real people inhabit these pages, the people we know and are, the people we long to be and are afraid to be: a mother and her brave, smart little girl, each coming to terms with the looming knowledge that the little girl will become a man; a wildly unreliable narrator bent on convincing us that her stories are not harmless; a woman with breast cancer, a frightened husband, and a best friend, all discovering that their lifelong triangle is not what they imagined; a man and his stepmother engaged in a complicated dance of memory, anger, and forgiveness. Amy Bloom takes us straight to the center of these lives with rare generosity and sublime wit, in flawless prose that is by turns sensuous, spare, heartbreaking, and laugh-out-loud funny.<br /><br />These are transcendent stories: about the uncertain gestures of love, about the betrayals and gifts of the body, about the surprises and bounties of the heart, and about what comes to us unbidden and what we choose.",

Lorsque la nouvelle para\u00eet en 1943 \u00e0 Stockholm, Zweig s'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 donn\u00e9 la mort, pr\u00e9f\u00e9rant abandonner sereinement une vie dont il ne voyait plus le sens. La <i>Schachnovelle</i> est l'ultime cadeau d'un \u00e9crivain qui, pour s'excuser de son d\u00e9part impromptu, l\u00e8gue \u00e0 ses amis et \u00e0 la post\u00e9rit\u00e9 ce qu'il poss\u00e8de de plus beau. Non comme une relique, mais comme une arme \u00e0 utiliser dans le combat commun pour la victoire de l'esprit.",

    "description": "Set in seventeenth-century Denmark, Rose Tremain's dazzling, prize-winning tale is a pungently atmospheric, richly provocative, and masterfully orchestrated romance of point and counterpoint: loyalty and deception...tenderness and violence...community and alienation...peace and conflict...\"Music &amp; Silence.\" Peter Claire is an English lutenist summoned to Denmark to join King Christian IV's royal orchestra. Designated the king's \"Angel\" because of the purity of his physical beauty, Peter falls helplessly in love with the lovely companion of Queen Kirsten, the king's adulterous wife. The young musician finds himself dangerously torn between loyalties, ensnared in the deep-seated unrest of a royal court where the forces of good and evil, of harmony and dissonance, are ensconced in a battle to the death.",

This is where it all begins -- with the tourist Twoflower and his wizard guide, Rincewind.<br /><br /><i>On a world supported on the back of a giant turtle (sex unknown), a gleeful, explosive, wickedly eccentric expedition sets out. There's an avaricious but inept wizard, a naive tourist whose luggage moves on hundreds of dear little legs, dragons who only exist if you believe in them, and of course THE EDGE of the planet...</i>",

    "description": "\"One of the great stories of our time . . . a wonderful anecdotal history of a great drama.\"<br />--San Francisco Chronicle Book Review<br /><br />As Washington Post correspondent in Moscow, Warsaw, and Yugoslavia in the final decade of the Soviet empire, Michael Dobbs had a ringside seat to the extraordinary events that led to the unraveling of the Bolshevik Revolution.\u00a0\u00a0From Tito's funeral to the birth of Solidarity in the Gda&amp;acute;nsk shipyard, from the tragedy of Tiananmen Square to Boris Yeltsin standing on a tank in the center of Moscow, Dobbs saw it all.<br /><br />The fall of communism was one of the great human dramas of our century, as great a drama as the original Bolshevik revolution. Dobbs met almost all of the principal actors, including Mikhail Gorbachev, Lech Walesa, V\u00e1clav Havel, and Andrei Sakharov. With a sweeping command of the subject and the passion and verve of an eyewitness, he paints an unforgettable portrait of the decade in which the familiar and seemingly petrified Cold War world--the world of Checkpoint Charlie and Dr. Strangelove--vanished forever.<br /><br /><br />\"Down with Big Brother ranks very high among the plethora of books about the fall of the Soviet Union and the death throes of Communism. It is possibly the most vividly written of the lot.\"<br />-- Adam B. Ulam, Washington Post Book World",

Maya Angelou\u2019s debut memoir is a modern American classic beloved worldwide.<br /> \u00a0<br /> Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local \u201cpowhitetrash.\u201d At eight years old and back at her mother\u2019s side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her age\u2014and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors (\u201cI met and fell in love with William Shakespeare\u201d) will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned.<br /> \u00a0<br /> Poetic and powerful, <i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</i> will touch hearts and change minds for as long as people read.<br /><b>\u00a0</b><br /><b>\u201c<i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</i> liberates the reader into life simply because Maya Angelou confronts her own life with such a moving wonder, such a luminous dignity.\u201d\u2014James Baldwin</b>",

    "description": "This book consists of two parts: \"The Law of Peoples,\" a major reworking of a much shorter article by the same name published in 1993, and the essay \"The Idea of Public Reason Revisited,\" first published in 1997. Taken together, they are the culmination of more than fifty years of reflection on liberalism and on some of the most pressing problems of our times by John Rawls.<br /><br />\"The Law of Peoples\" extends the idea of a social contract to the Society of Peoples and lays out the general principles that can and should be accepted by both liberal and non-liberal societies as the standard for regulating their behavior toward one another. In particular, it draws a crucial distinction between basic human rights and the rights of each citizen of a liberal constitutional democracy. It explores the terms under which such a society may appropriately wage war against an \"outlaw society\" and discusses the moral grounds for rendering assistance to non-liberal societies burdened by unfavorable political and economic conditions.<br /><br />\"The Idea of Public Reason Revisited\" explains why the constraints of public reason, a concept first discussed in <i>Political Liberalism</i> (1993), are ones that holders of both religious and non-religious comprehensive views can reasonably endorse. It is Rawls's most detailed account of how a modern constitutional democracy, based on a liberal political conception, could and would be viewed as legitimate by reasonable citizens who on religious, philosophical, or moral grounds do not themselves accept a liberal comprehensive doctrine--such as that of Kant, or Mill, or Rawls's own \"Justice as Fairness,\" presented in <i>A Theory of Justice</i> (1971).",

    "description": "In the village of King's Abbot, a widow's sudden suicide sparks rumors that she murdered her first husband, was being blackmailed, and was carrying on a secret affair with the wealthy Roger Ackroyd. The following evening, Ackroyd is murdered in his locked study--but not before receiving a letter identifying the widow's blackmailer. King's Abbot is crawling with suspects, including a nervous butler, Ackroyd's wayward stepson, and his sister-in-law, Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd, who has taken up residence in the victim's home. It's now up to the famous detective Hercule Poirot, who has retired to King's Abbot to garden, to solve the case of who killed Roger Ackroyd--a task in which he is aided by the village doctor and narrator, James Sheppard, and by Sheppard's ingenious sister, Caroline.<br /><br /><i>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</i> is the book that made Agatha Christie a household name and launched her career as a perennial bestseller. Originally published in 1926, it is a landmark in the mystery genre. It was in the vanguard of a new class of popular detective fiction that ushered in the modern era of mystery novels.",

These can mostly be read as stand-alone in any order, but based on internal chronology <i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</i> is the first Poirot story and <i>Curtain</i> was written to be the final Poirot story and should be read last. Other points to note are:\n    \n    1. <i>Lord Edgware Dies</i> should be read before <i>After the Funeral</i>.\n    2. <i>Five Little Pigs</i> should be read before <i>Elephants Can Remember</i>.\n    3. <i>Cat Among the Pigeons</i> should be read before <i>Hallowe\u2019en Party</i>.\n    4. <i>Mrs McGinty\u2019s Dead</i> should be read before <i>Hallowe\u2019en Party</i> and <i>Elephants Can Remember</i>.\n    5. <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i> should be read before <i>Murder in Mesopotamia</i>.\n    6. <i>Three Act Tragedy</i> should be read before <i>Hercule Poirot\u2019s Christmas</i>.\n    \n    <i>Black Coffee</i> by Charles Osborne (#45 on this list) is a novelization of Agatha Christie's play of the same name (#7 on this list).\n    \n    The two volumes <i>Hercule Poirot: The Complete Short Stories</i> and <i>Hercule Poirot's Casebook</i> <b>BOTH</b> contain <b>ALL</b> of the Poirot short stories.\n    \n    Most of Book #38.1 \"The Under Dog and Other Stories\" stories can be found in book #38 \"Poirot's Early Cases\".\n    \n    Note that many books of Agatha Christie short stories contain a mixture of detectives. For example, <i>Problem at Pollensa Bay</i> contains 8 stories but only 2 feature Poirot.",

    "description": "From award-winning writer David Mitchell comes a sinewy, meditative novel of boyhood on the cusp of adulthood and the old on the cusp of the new.<br /><br />Black Swan Green tracks a single year in what is, for thirteen-year-old Jason Taylor, the sleepiest village in muddiest Worcestershire in a dying Cold War England, 1982. But the thirteen chapters, each a short story in its own right, create an exquisitely observed world that is anything but sleepy. A world of Kissingeresque realpolitik enacted in boys\u2019 games on a frozen lake; of \u201cnightcreeping\u201d through the summer backyards of strangers; of the tabloid-fueled thrills of the Falklands War and its human toll; of the cruel, luscious Dawn Madden and her power-hungry boyfriend, Ross Wilcox; of a certain Madame Eva van Outryve de Crommelynck, an elderly bohemian emigr\u00e9 who is both more and less than she appears; of Jason\u2019s search to replace his dead grandfather\u2019s irreplaceable smashed watch before the crime is discovered; of first cigarettes, first kisses, first Duran Duran LPs, and first deaths; of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s recession; of Gypsies camping in the woods and the hysteria they inspire; and, even closer to home, of a slow-motion divorce in four seasons.<br /><br />Pointed, funny, profound, left-field, elegiac, and painted with the stuff of life, Black Swan Green is David Mitchell\u2019s subtlest and most effective achievement to date.",

    "description": "After a year of grand adventures touring the classical ruins of Italy and Greece, Iphiginia Bright returned to England to discover that the real excitement was at home. It seems that her Aunt Zoe has fallen victim to a sinister blackmailer and only Iphiginia can hope to stop the culprit before he can do more harm. Her plan is inspired: Imitating history's most legendary beauties--Cleopatra, Helen of Troy, Aphrodite--the former schoolmistress will remake herself, and descend upon London Society as the dazzling mistress of Marcus Valerius Cloud, the infamous Earl of Masters. Rumors hint that the Earl has disappeared at the blackmailer's hands, and by posing as his unknown mistress, Iphiginia is convinced she can ferret out the villain. Overnight, Iphiginia is transformed into a vision with a host of eager admirers, including one she does not expect -- the Earl of Masters himself, who strides into a shimmering ballroom one evening to cooly reclaim his \"mistress\". He is everything they say he is... arrogant, attractive, devastatingly seductive, and Iphiginia can't help but be enthralled. But when Marcus agrees to play along with her charade, she doesn't know that the determined earl has plans of his own: to tease and tempt her, until the beautiful deceiver becomes more than his mistress in name only.",

    "description": "Set in the perfectly realized world of imperial tenth-century Japan, <i>The Book of Loss</i> is a gripping novel of sexual jealousy at court.<br />A renowned storyteller and lady-in-waiting to the Empress, the narrator is locked in a bitter rivalry with another woman for the love of a banished nobleman. Forced to observe the complex rules and social hierarchies of court life, she finds herself caught in a trap of her own making. Her machinations reach such a pitch that they threaten to undermine the rule of the Emperor himself. She records her plight, and her acidulous observations of courtly life, in her diary. Her voice is unforgettable--both foreign and utterly modern. Her sense of loss is unbearable, her love is all-consuming, and it will push her to the extremes of rivalry.<br />Offering the intimate seductions and betrayals of <i>Dangerous Liaisons</i> and <i>The Memoirs of a Geisha</i>, <i>The Book of Loss</i> takes the reader into the farthest reaches of desire, where passion rules and jealousy leads to unthinkable acts.",

Through lucid, pragmatic explanations, he shows how dreams such as universal primary education, a successful war against the AIDS pandemic, and environmental sustainability, are within the grasp of humanity. For anyone interested in forging a better world in the third millennium, <i>Freedom from Want</i> is powerful testimony.",

    "description": "A breathtaking true story of a rescue mission undertaken by a young woman and her family in one of the most repressive countries in the world.<br /><br />Helie Lee often had heard her grandmother speak of an uncle, lost decades ago when he was a child during the family\u2019s daring escape from North Korea. As an adult, he was still living there under horrid conditions. When her grandmother began to ail, Helie became determined to reunite her with her eldest son, despite tremendous odds. Helie\u2019s mission became even more urgent when she realized that her first book, the bestselling novel <b>Still Life with Rice</b>, about the family\u2019s escape, might have angered the North Korean government and put her uncle in danger. <br /><br />Pushing through rivers and forests, fighting the cold, bribing and manipulating border guards, gangsters, and secret service agents, Helie and her father finally achieve their goal. But there are many hurdles. Her uncle is forced to make a harrowing choice: leave his North Korean family behind or continue to live in oppression and starvation away from his beloved mother. And Helie has to face her deep, sometimes ambivalent, emotions about her identity in the family and as a Korean American woman. Unmarried and outspoken, she struggles in Korea, where women marry early and keep silent, and writes eloquently about the landscape there, both literal and cultural. She comes through a heartbreaking love affair only to face an intense and confusing relationship with the Guide\u2014the man who, despite being crude and macho, ultimately helps to save her uncle and eventually his extended family through several daring acts of heroism. <br /><br /><b>In the Absence of Sun</b> is a riveting adventure story and a powerful tale of family bonds and reunion.<br /><br />\u201cAn eerie fear crawled through my flesh as I stood on the Chinese side of the Yalu River, gazing across the murky water into one of the most closed-off and isolated countries in the world. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Even as my boots sank into the doughy mud, I had trouble coming to terms with the fact that I was actually standing there. . . . I was not prepared for the kind of despair and insane fear I felt that day. My wizened old uncle looked nothing like the sweet-faced teenager in the faded photograph that Halmoni kept pressed between the pages of her Bible. That day, at the Yalu River, staring helplessly into his terrorized face, I hadn\u2019t fully realized what a dangerous thing I had done the year before. I had placed him and his family in danger. By including details of my uncle\u2019s life in a book, I had alerted North Korea\u2019s enigmatic leadership to the identity of my relatives in a nation where it was better to remain invisible.\u201d \u2014From <b>In the Absence of Sun</b><br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "<i>A dazzling work of personal travelogue and cultural criticism that ranges from the primitive to the postmodern in a quest for the promise and meaning of the psychedelic experience. </i><br /><br />While psychedelics of all sorts are demonized in America today, the visionary compounds found in plants are the spiritual sacraments of tribal cultures around the world. From the iboga of the Bwiti in Gabon, to the Mazatecs of Mexico, these plants are sacred because they awaken the mind to other levels of awareness--to a holographic vision of the universe.<br /><br /><i>Breaking Open the Head</i> is a passionate, multilayered, and sometimes rashly personal inquiry into this deep division. On one level, Daniel Pinchbeck tells the story of the encounters between the modern consciousness of the West and these sacramental substances, including such thinkers as Allen Ginsberg, Antonin Artaud, Walter Benjamin, and Terence McKenna, and a new underground of present-day ethnobotanists, chemists, psychonauts, and philosophers. It is also a scrupulous recording of the author's wide-ranging investigation with these outlaw compounds, including a thirty-hour tribal initiation in West Africa; an all-night encounter with the master shamans of the South American rain forest; and a report from a psychedelic utopia in the Black Rock Desert that is the Burning Man Festival.<br /><br /><i>Breaking Open the Head</i> is brave participatory journalism at its best, a vivid account of psychic and intellectual experiences that opened doors in the wall of Western rationalism and completed Daniel Pinchbeck's personal transformation from a jaded Manhattan journalist to shamanic initiate and grateful citizen of the cosmos.<br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

Il est retrouv\u00e9 le lendemain et l'attestation de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s est sign\u00e9e par deux m\u00e9decins. Cinq heures plus tard, son c\u009cur recommence \u00e0 battre. La mort a refus\u00e9 Pilgrim. <br />R\u00e9fugi\u00e9 dans le mutisme, Pilgrim est intern\u00e9 \u00e0 la clinique psychiatrique Burgh\u00f6lzli de Zurich o\u00f9 l'un des m\u00e9decins, Carl Gustav Jung, est imm\u00e9diatement fascin\u00e9 par ce cas hors du commun.

Un roman d'une construction brillante et hardie, \u00e0 l'\u00e9criture jubilatoire.",

    "description": "Narrated by Charlie Kilworth, whose birth is an echo of his mother's own illegitimate beginnings, T<em>he Piano Man's Daughter</em> is the lyrical, multilayered tale of Charlie's mother, Lily, his grandmother Ede, and their family. Lily is a woman pursued by her own demons, \"making off with the matches just when the fires caught hold,\" \"a beautiful, mad genius, first introduced to us singing in her mother's belly.\" It is also the tale of people who dream in songs, two Irish immigrant families facing a new and uncertain future in turn-of-the-century Toronto. Finally, it is a richly detailed tribute to a golden epoch in our history and of a generation striking the last, haunting chord of innocence.<br /><br /><em>The Piano Man's Daughter</em> is a symphony of wonderful storytelling, unforgettable characters, and a lilting, lingering melody that plays on long after the last page has been turned.",

    "description": "Five masterful dramatic works from one of the world's best-loved playwrights, Anton Chekhov's <i>Plays</i> is translated with notes by Peter Carson, and an introduction by Richard Gilman in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />At a time when the Russian theatre was dominated by formulaic melodramas and farces, Chekhov created a new sort of drama that laid bare the everyday lives, loves and yearnings of ordinary people. <i>Ivanov</i> depicts a man stifled by inactivity and lost idealism, and <i>The Seagull</i> contrasts a young man's selfish romanticism with the stoicism of a woman cruelly abandoned by her lover. With 'the scenes from country life' of <i>Uncle Vanya</i>, his first fully mature play, Chekhov developed his own unique dramatic world, neither tragedy nor comedy. In <i>Three Sisters the Prozorov</i> sisters endlessly dream of going to Moscow to escape the monotony of provincial life, while his comedy <i>The Cherry Orchard</i> portrays characters futilely clinging to the past as their land is sold from underneath them.<br /><br />Peter Carson's moving translations convey Chekhov's subtle blend of comedy, tragedy and psychological insight. In his introduction, Richard Gilman examines how Chekhov broke with theatrical conventions and discusses each play in detail.<br /><br />Anton Chekhov (1860-1904) was born in Taganrog, a port on the sea of Azov. In 1879 he travelled to Moscow, where he entered the medical faculty of the university, graduating in 1884. During his university years, he supported his family by contributing humorous stories and sketches to magazines. He published his first volume of stories, <i>Motley Tales</i>, in 1886, and a year later his second volume <i>In the Twilight,</i> for which he received the Pushkin Prize. Today his plays, including <i>Uncle Vanya</i>, <i>The Seagull</i>, and <i>The Cherry Orchard</i> are recognised as masterpieces the world over.<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>Plays</i>, you might like Chekhov's <i>The Shooting Party</i>, also available in Penguin Classics.",

    "description": "The men on board HMS Terror have every expectation of triumph. As part of the 1845 Franklin Expedition, the first steam-powered vessels ever to search for the legendary Northwest Passage, they are as scientifically supported an enterprise as has ever set forth. As they enter a second summer in the Arctic Circle without a thaw, though, they are stranded in a nightmarish landscape of encroaching ice and darkness. Endlessly cold, with diminishing rations, 126 men fight to survive with poisonous food, a dwindling supply of coal, and ships buckling in the grip of crushing ice. But their real enemy is far more terrifying. There is something out there in the frigid darkness: an unseen predator stalking their ship, a monstrous terror constantly clawing to get in.When the expedition's leader, Sir John Franklin, meets a terrible death, Captain Francis Crozier takes command and leads his surviving crewmen on a last, desperate attempt to flee south across the ice. With them travels an Inuit woman who cannot speak and who may be the key to survival, or the harbinger of their deaths. But as another winter approaches, as scurvy and starvation grow more terrible, and as the terror on the ice stalks them southward, Crozier and his men begin to fear that there is no escape.",

Carol Shields gives us, as it were, a CAT scan of his life, in episodes between 1977 and 1997 that flash back and forward seamlessly. As Larry journeys toward the millennium, adapting to society's changing expectations of men, Shields' elegant prose makes the trivial into the momentous. Among all the paradoxes and accidents of his existence, Larry moves through the spontaneity of the seventies, the blind enchantment of the eighties and the lean, mean nineties, completing at last his quiet, stubborn search of self. Larry's odyssey mirrors the male condition at the end of our century with targeted wit, unerring poignancy and faultless wisdom.",

    "description": "With a viewpoint that shifts as crisply as cards in the hands of a blackjack dealer, Carol Shields introduces us to two shell-shocked veterans of the wars of the heart. There's Fay, a folklorist whose passion for mermaids has kept her from focusing on any one man. And right across the street there's Tom, a popular radio talk-show host who has focused a little too intently, having married and divorced three times.<br /><br />Can Fay believe in lasting love with such a man? Will romantic love conquer all rational expectations? Only Carol Shields could describe so adroitly this couple who fall in love as thoroughly and satisfyingly as any Victorian couple and the modern complications that beset them in this touching and ironic book.",

    "description": "With its explorations of sexual ambivalence, As You Like It speaks directly to the twenty-first century. <br /><br />In her introduction, Juliet Dusinberre demonstrates that Rosalind's authority in the play grows from new ideas about women and reveals that Shakespeare's heroine reinvents herself for every age. But the play is also deeply rooted in Elizabethan culture and through it Shakespeare addresses some of the hotly debated issues of the period.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i>\"This will be the definitive edition of As You Like It for many years to come\"</i>\n</b> - Phyllis Rackin, University of Pennsylvania.",

    "description": "This best-selling classical mechanics text, written for the advanced undergraduate one- or two-semester course, provides a complete account of the classical mechanics of particles, systems of particles, and rigid bodies. Vector calculus is used extensively to explore topics.The Lagrangian formulation of mechanics is introduced early to show its powerful problem solving ability.. Modern notation and terminology are used throughout in support of the text's objective: to facilitate students' transition to advanced physics and the mathematical formalism needed for the quantum theory of physics. CLASSICAL DYNAMICS OF PARTICLES AND SYSTEMS can easily be used for a one- or two-semester course, depending on the instructor's choice of topics.",

And Tokyo's exotic nightlife -- teeming with intoxicants, pornography, and three-hour love hotels -- enables her to keep her demons at bay. Working as an English specialist at Air-Pro Stewardess Training Institute by day, and losing herself in a sex- and drug-addled oblivion by night, Margaret represses memories of her painful childhood and her older brother Frank's descent into madness.<br /><br />But Margaret's deliberate nihilism is thrown off balance as she becomes increasingly haunted by images of a Western girl missing in Tokyo. And when she becomes enamored of Kazu, a mysterious gangster, their affair sparks a chain of events that could spell tragedy for Margaret, in a city where it's all too easy to disappear.",

    "description": "Learn to Develop Life's Most Important SkillWhat is the one thing everyone wants? Happiness. But where do we find it? French Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard has been working with scientists and Buddhist scholars to explore the effects of meditation on the brain and its correlation with happiness. What he discovered: Happiness is not something you seek, but rather it is a skill you develop. On Happiness, the former cellular biologist merges the newest scientific research with traditional Buddhist teachings and contemporary Western philosophy to show you the keys to realizing the experience of happiness. Join Ricard on this audio adaptation of his book of the same title to learn more about: How to cultivate sukha a balanced state of well-being that arises when we release ourselves from mental blindness and afflictive emotionsPractices for working with your mind to develop attention, focus, and clarity a foundation for inner peaceHow to work with the ego and time to enter the state of flow Evidence of the profound and measurable effects of inner well-being on our bodies and minds continues to grow. Join Matthieu Ricard as your guide in unfolding the state of being that transcends all other circumstances and emotions authentic happiness.\"",

Helprin\u2019s latest work, an extraordinarily funny allegory about a most peculiar British royal family, is immensely mocking of contemporary monarchy and yet deeply sympathetic to the individuals caught in its lonely absurdities.",

    "description": "Carol Shields, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and Blanche Howard, winner of the Canadian Booksellers' Award, teamed up to write this delightful epistolary novel that probes the inner life of one couple's rocky marriage. Faced with a job-related ten-month separation, Jocelyn and Charles choose to maintain contact through letters -- an economic decision that paves the way for two very different and very entertaining sides of the same story. As the months progress, the couple's letters grow less frequent and more revealing -- and their \"season of celibacy\" becomes more of a challenge than either Jocelyn or Charles had imagined. Posing important and timely questions about commitment, monogamy, and the pressures of career and money, this insightful novel by two extraordinary writers offers a perceptive and hopeful look at how men and women really communicate.",

They provide a penetrating look into life in Prague and into Kafka\u2019s accounts of his dreams, his feelings for the father he worshipped and the woman he could not bring himself to marry, his sense of guilt, and his feelings of being an outcast.

    "description": "With his U.S.A. trilogy, comprising THE 42nd PARALLEL, 1919, and THE BIG MONEY, John Dos Passos is said by many to have written the great American novel. While Fitzgerald and Hemingway were cultivating what Edmund Wilson once called their \"own little corners,\" John Dos Passos was taking on the world. Counted as one of the best novels of the twentieth century by the Modern Library and by some of the finest writers working today, U.S.A. is a grand, kaleidoscopic portrait of a nation, buzzing with history and life on every page. <br /><br />The trilogy opens with THE 42nd PARALLEL, where we find a young country at the dawn of the twentieth century. Slowly, in stories artfully spliced together, the lives and fortunes of five characters unfold. Mac, Janey, Eleanor, Ward, and Charley are caught on the storm track of this parallel and blown New Yorkward. As their lives cross and double back again, the likes of Eugene Debs, Thomas Edison, and Andrew Carnegie make cameo appearances.",

    "description": "Eugene O'Neill was the first American playwright to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. He completed <i>The Iceman Cometh</i> in 1939, but he delayed production until after the war, when it enjoyed a modest run in 1946 after receiving mixed reviews. Three years after O'Neill's death, Jason Robards starred in a Broadway revival that brought new critical attention to O'Neill\u2019s dark play. In the half century since, <i>The Iceman Cometh</i> has gained in stature. Kevin Spacey and James Earl Jones have played Hickey.\u00a0<i>The Iceman Cometh</i> focuses on a group of alcoholics who endlessly discuss but never act on their dreams, and Hickey, the traveling salesman determined to strip them of their pipe dreams.",

    "description": "Several months into his recovery from a near-fatal illness, novelist Sidney Orr enters a stationery shop in Brooklyn and buys a blue notebook. It is September 18, 1982, and for the next nine days Orr will live under the spell of this blank book, trapped inside a world of eerie premonitions and bewildering events that threaten to destroy his marriage and undermine his faith in reality.<br /><br />Paul Auster's mesmerizing eleventh novel reads like an old-fashioned ghost story. But there are no ghosts in this book - only flesh-and-blood human beings, wandering through the haunted realms of everyday life. Oracle Night is a narrative tour de force that confirms Auster's reputation as one of the boldest, most original writers at work in America today.",

Nobody knows what strange force partitioned space into these \"regions of thought,\" but when the warring Straumli realm use an ancient Transcendent artifact as a weapon, they unwittingly unleash an awesome power that destroys thousands of worlds and enslaves all natural and artificial intelligence.\n    \n    Vernor Vinge first used the concepts of <i>\"Zones of Thought\"</i> in a 1988 novella, <i>\"The Blabber\"</i>, which occurs after Fire. Vinge's novel, <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>, is a prequel to <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i> set 20,000 years earlier and featuring Pham Nuwen. Vinge's <i>Children of the Sky</i> is \"a near-term sequel to A Fire Upon the Deep\", set ten years later.\n    \n    Vinge's former wife, Joan D. Vinge, has also written stories in the Zones of Thought universe, based on his notes. These include <i>\"The Outcasts of Heaven Belt\"</i> and <i>\"Legacy\"</i>.\n    \n    Vernor Vinge won a Hugo Award for <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i>. He also won a Hugo, a John W. Campbell and a Prometheus Award for <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>.\n    \n    \n    Publication order is as follows:\n    \n    A Fire Upon the Deep\n    A Deepness in the Sky\n    The Children of the Sky\n    \n    \n    Chronological order is:\n    \n    A Deepness in the Sky\n    A Fire Upon the Deep\n    The Children of the Sky\n    \n    Some say \"The first book can be read as a stand-alone. Book 3 is the continuation of book 1, and has less of the space opera element. Book 2 can be skipped from the story, or can be read as it's own book. In the timeline it is a prequel but it is loosely related to book 1.\"",

    "description": "Sixteen-year-old Nomi Nickel longs to hang out with Lou Reed and Marianne Faithfull in New York City\u2019s East Village. Instead she\u2019s trapped in East Village, Manitoba, a small town whose population is Mennonite: \u201cthe most embarrassing sub-sect of people to belong to if you\u2019re a teenager.\u201d East Village is a town with no train and no bar whose job prospects consist of slaughtering chickens at the Happy Family Farms abattoir or churning butter for tourists at the pioneer village. Ministered with an iron fist by Nomi\u2019s uncle Hans, a.k.a. The Mouth of Darkness, East Village is a town that\u2019s tall on rules and short on fun: no dancing, drinking, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, recreational sex, swimming, make-up, jewellery, playing pool, going to cities or staying up past nine o\u2019clock.<br /><br />As the novel begins, Nomi struggles to cope with the back-to-back departures three years earlier of Tash, her beautiful and mouthy sister, and Trudie, her warm and spirited mother. She lives with her father, Ray, a sweet yet hapless schoolteacher whose love is unconditional but whose parenting skills amount to benign neglect. Father and daughter deal with their losses in very different ways. Ray, a committed elder of the church, seeks to create an artificial sense of order by reorganizing the city dump late at night. Nomi, on the other hand, favours chaos as she tries to blunt her pain through \u201cdrugs and imagination.\u201d Together they live in a limbo of unanswered questions.<br /><br />Nomi\u2019s first person narrative shifts effortlessly between the present and the past. Within the present, Nomi goes through the motions of finishing high school while flagrantly rebelling against Mennonite tradition. She hangs out on Suicide Hill, hooks up with a boy named Travis, goes on the Pill, wanders around town, skips class and cranks Led Zeppelin. But the past is never far from her mind as she remembers happy times with her mother and sister \u2014 as well as the painful events that led them to flee town. Throughout, in a voice both defiant and vulnerable, she offers hilarious and heartbreaking reflections on life, death, family, faith and love.<br /><br />Eventually Nomi\u2019s grief \u2014 and a growing sense of hypocrisy \u2014 cause her to spiral ever downward to a climax that seems at once startling and inevitable. But even when one more loss is heaped on her piles of losses, Nomi maintains hope and finds the imagination and willingness to envision what lies beyond.<br /><br />Few novels in recent years have generated as much excitement as <b>A Complicated Kindness</b>. Winner of the Governor General\u2019s Award and a Giller Prize Finalist, Miriam Toews\u2019s third novel has earned both critical acclaim and a long and steady position on our national bestseller lists. In the <i>Globe and Mail</i>, author Bill Richardson writes the following: \u201cThere is so much that\u2019s accomplished and fine. The momentum of the narrative, the quality of the storytelling, the startling images, the brilliant rendering of a time and place, the observant, cataloguing eye of the writer, her great grace. But if I had to name Miriam Toews\u2019s crowning achievement, it would be the creation of Nomi Nickel, who deserves to take her place beside Daisy Goodwill Flett, Pi Patel and Hagar Shipley as a brilliantly realized character for whom the reader comes to care, okay, comes to love.\u201d<br /><br /><br /><i>This town is so severe. And silent. It makes me crazy, the silence. I wonder if a person can die from it. The town office building has a giant filing cabinet full of death certificates that say choked to death on his own anger or suffocated from unexpressed feelings of unhappiness. Silentium. People here just can\u2019t wait to die, it seems. It\u2019s the main event. The only reason we\u2019re not all snuffed at birth is because that would reduce our suffering by a lifetime. My guidance counsellor has suggested to me that I change my attitude about this place and learn to love it. But I do, I told her. Oh, that\u2019s rich, she said. That\u2019s rich. . .<br /><br />We\u2019re Mennonites. After Dukhobors who show up naked in court we are the most embarrassing sub-sect of people to belong to if you\u2019re a teenager. Five hundred years ago in Europe a man named Menno Simons set off to do his own peculiar religious thing and he and his followers were beaten up and killed or forced to conform all over Holland, Poland, and Russia until they, at least some of them, finally landed right here where I sit. Imagine the least well-adjusted kid in your school starting a breakaway clique of people whose manifesto includes a ban on the media, dancing, smoking , temperate climates, movies, drinking, rock\u2019n\u2019roll, having sex for fun, swimming, makeup, jewellery, playing pool, going to cities, or staying up past nine o\u2019clock. That was Menno all over. Thanks a lot, Menno.<br /></i>\u2014from <b>A Complicated Kindness</b><br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "In <b>City of Saints and Madmen</b>, Jeff VanderMeer has reinvented the literature of the fantastic. You hold in your hands an invitation to a place unlike any you\u2019ve ever visited\u2013an invitation delivered by one of our most audacious and astonishing literary magicians. <br /><br />City of elegance and squalor. Of religious fervor and wanton lusts. And everywhere, on the walls of courtyards and churches, an incandescent fungus of mysterious and ominous origin. In Ambergris, a would-be suitor discovers that a sunlit street can become a killing ground in the blink of an eye. An artist receives an invitation to a beheading\u2013and finds himself enchanted. And a patient in a mental institution is convinced he\u2019s made up a city called Ambergris, imagined its every last detail, and that he\u2019s really from a place called Chicago.\u2026<br /><br />By turns sensuous and terrifying, filled with exotica and eroticism, this interwoven collection of stories, histories, and \u201ceyewitness\u201d reports invokes a universe within a puzzlebox where you can lose\u2013and find\u2013yourself again.",

Interwoven with The Beatles own memories are the recollections of such associates as road manager Neil Aspinall, producer George Martin, and spokesman Derek Taylor. <i>The Beatles Anthology</i> is a once-in-a-lifetime volume: warm, frank, funny, poignant, and bold-just like the music thats been a part of so many of our lives. <i>The Beatles Anthology</i> is, for the first time, the story of The Beatles by The Beatles. Created with the full cooperation of Paul, George, Ringo, and Yoko Ono Lennon, it also includes the words of John, painstakingly compiled from sources worldwide. <i>The Beatles Anthology</i> is, in effect, The Beatles autobiography.<i>The Beatles Anthology</i> features over 1300 images, most previously unpublished. Paul, George, Ringo, and Yoko Ono Lennon all opened their own archives just for this project, as did Apple, EMI, and others long associated with The Beatles, allowing the unprecedented release of photographs, documents, and other memorabilia from their homes and offices. The result is an extraordinary wealth of visual material brimming on each and every page.",

    "description": "<i>Wise Blood</i>, Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s astonishing and haunting first novel, is a classic of twentieth-century literature. It is a story of Hazel Motes, a twenty-two-year-old caught in an unending struggle against his innate, desperate faith. He falls under the spell of a \"blind\" street preacher named Asa Hawks and his degenerate fifteen-year-old daughter, Lily Sabbath. In an ironic, malicious gesture of his own non-faith, and to prove himself a greater cynic than Hawkes, Hazel Motes founds The Church of God Without Christ, but is still thwarted in his efforts to lose God. He meets Enoch Emery, a young man with \"wise blood,\" who leads him to a mummified holy child, and whose crazy maneuvers are a manifestation of Hazel's existential struggles. This tale of redemption, retribution, false prophets, blindness, blindings, and wisdoms gives us one of the most riveting characters in twentieth-century American fiction.",

    "description": "A finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award<br /><br />Billy Strayhorn (1915-67) was one of the greatest composers in the history of American music, the creator of a body of work that includes such standards as \"Take the 'A' Train.\" Yet all his life Strayhorn was overshadowed by his friend and collaborator Duke Ellington, with whom he worked for three decades as the Ellington Orchestra's ace songwriter and arranger. A \"definitive\" corrective (<i>USA Today</i>) to decades of patchwork scholarship and journalism about this giant of jazz, David Hajdu's <i>Lush Life</i> is a vibrant and absorbing account of the \"lush life\" that Strayhorn and other jazz musicians led in Harlem and Paris. While composing some of the most gorgeous American music of the twentieth century, Strayhorn labored under a complex agreement whereby Ellington took the bows for his work. Until his life was tragically cut short by cancer and alcohol abuse, the small, shy composer carried himself with singular style and grace as one of the few jazzmen to be openly homosexual. <i>Lush Life</i> has sparked an enthusiastic revival of interest in Strayhorn's work and is already acknowledged as a jazz classic.",

Avant la guerre, Albert Camus con\u00e7oit Caligula, ainsi que Sisyphe ou Meursault (L'\u00c9tranger), comme un h\u00e9ros de l'Absurde. En 1945, la pi\u00e8ce est re\u00e7ue comme une fable sur les horreurs du nazisme. Ses versions et ses mises en sc\u00e8ne successives, l'\u00e9volution de la sensibilit\u00e9 du public ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 faire de Caligula une des figures les plus troublantes de notre th\u00e9\u00e2tre. \u00c0 l'image du tyran se superposent, dans notre m\u00e9moire, les visages de G\u00e9rard Philipe, qui cr\u00e9a le r\u00f4le, et celui d'Albert Camus, qui m\u00eala toujours au besoin de tendresse et \u00e0 l'exigence de puret\u00e9 une \u00e9trange \u00abfixation au meurtre\u00bb et \u00abcette violence int\u00e9rieure\u00bb (Jean Grenier) qui anime son empereur romain.",

    "description": "On September 16, 2007, machine gun fire erupted in Baghdad's Nisour Square, leaving seventeen Iraqi civilians dead, among them women and children. The shooting spree, labeled \"Baghdad's Bloody Sunday,\" was neither the work of Iraqi insurgents nor U.S. soldiers. The shooters were private forces working for the secretive mercenary company, Blackwater Worldwide. <br /> This is the explosive story of a company that rose a decade ago from Moyock, North Carolina, to become one of the most powerful players in the \"War on Terror.\" In his gripping bestseller, award-winning journalist Jeremy Scahill takes us from the bloodied streets of Iraq to hurricane-ravaged New Orleans to the chambers of power in Washington, to expose Blackwater as the frightening new face of the U.S. war machine.<br />",

But when he meets the hauntingly pale, steely-eyed Joshua York, he is certain. For York doesn\u2019t care that the icy winter of 1857 has wiped out all but one of Marsh\u2019s dilapidated fleet. Nor does he care that he won\u2019t earn back his investment in a decade. York has his own reasons for wanting to traverse the powerful Mississippi. And they are to be none of Marsh\u2019s concern\u2014no matter how bizarre, arbitrary, or capricious his actions may prove. <br /><br />Marsh meant to turn down York\u2019s offer. It was too full of secrets that spelled danger. But the promise of both gold and a grand new boat that could make history crushed his resolve\u2014coupled with the terrible force of York\u2019s mesmerizing gaze. Not until the maiden voyage of his new sidewheeler Fevre Dream would Marsh realize he had joined a mission both more sinister, and perhaps more noble, than his most fantastic nightmare...and mankind\u2019s most impossible dream. <br /><br />Here is the spellbinding tale of a vampire\u2019s quest to unite his race with humanity, of a garrulous riverman\u2019s dream of immortality, and of the undying legends of the steamboat era and a majestic, ancient river.",

    "description": "In 480 B.C., Xerxes, the King of Persia, led an invasion of mainland Greece. Its success should have been a formality. For seventy years, victory\u2014rapid, spectacular victory\u2014had seemed the birthright of the Persian Empire. In the space of a single generation, they had swept across the Near East, shattering ancient kingdoms, storming famous cities, putting together an empire which stretched from India to the shores of the Aegean. As a result of those conquests, Xerxes ruled as the most powerful man on the planet. Yet somehow, astonishingly, against the largest expeditionary force ever assembled, the Greeks of the mainland managed to hold out. The Persians were turned back. Greece remained free. Had the Greeks been defeated in the epochal naval battle at Salamis, not only would the West have lost its first struggle for independence and survival, but it is unlikely that there would ever have been such an entity as the West at all.<br />Tom Holland\u2019s brilliant new book describes the very first \u201cclash of Empires\u201d between East and West. As he did in the critically praised <i>Rubicon</i>, he has found extraordinary parallels between the ancient world and our own. There is no other popular history that takes in the entire sweep of the Persian Wars, and no other classical historian, academic or popular, who combines scholarly rigor with novelistic depth with a worldly irony in quite the fashion that Tom Holland does.",

Each critical essay is accompanied by a succinct introduction to the history, principles, and practice of the critical perspective and by a bibliography that promotes further exploration of that approach. In addition, the text and essays are complemented by an introduction providing biographical and historical contexts for Hardy and Tess of the d'Urbervilles, a survey of critical responses to the work since its initial publication, and a glossary of critical and theoretical terms.",

    "description": "Believe it or not, some readers find <i>Zodiac</i> even more fun than Neal Stephenson's defining 1990s cyberpunk novel, <i>Snow Crash</i>. <i>Zodiac</i> is set in Boston, and hero Sangamon Taylor (S. T.) ironically describes his hilarious exploits in the first person. S. T. is a modern superhero, a self-proclaimed Toxic Spiderman. With stealth, spunk, and the backing of GEE (a non-profit environmental group) as his weapons, S. T. chases down the bad guys with James Bond-like Zen. <p> Cruising Boston Harbor with lab tests and scuba gear, S. T. rides in with the ecosystem cavalry on his 40-horsepower Zodiac raft. His job of tracking down poisonous runoff and embarrassing the powerful corporations who caused them becomes more sticky than usual; run-ins with a gang of satanic rock fans, a deranged geneticist, and a mysterious PCB contamination that may or may not be man-made--plus a falling-out with his competent (\"I adore stress\") girlfriend--all complicate his mission. </p><p> Stephenson/S. T.'s irreverent, facetious, esprit-filled voice make this near-future tale a joy to read.</p>",

Magee is the Carl Sagan of philosophy, the great popularizer of the subject, and author of a major new introductory history, The Story of Philosophy. Confessions follows the course of Magee's life, exploring philosophers and ideas as he himself encountered them, introducing all the great figures and their ideas, from the pre-Socratics to Bertrand Russell and Karl Popper, including Wittgenstein, Kant, Nietzsche, and Schopenhauer, rationalism, utilitarianism, empiricism, and existentialism.",

    "description": "The moving, inspiring memoir of one of the great women of our times, Shirin Ebadi, winner of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize and advocate for the oppressed, whose spirit has remained strong in the face of political persecution and despite the challenges she has faced raising a family while pursuing her work. <br />Best known in this country as the lawyer working tirelessly on behalf of Canadian photojournalist, Zara Kazemi - raped, tortured and murdered in Iran - Dr. Ebadi offers us a vivid picture of the struggles of one woman against the system. The book movingly chronicles her childhood in a loving, untraditional family, her upbringing before the Revolution in 1979 that toppled the Shah, her marriage and her religious faith, as well as her life as a mother and lawyer battling an oppressive regime in the courts while bringing up her girls at home. <br />Outspoken, controversial, Shirin Ebadi is one of the most fascinating women today. She rose quickly to become the first female judge in the country; but when the religious authorities declared women unfit to serve as judges she was demoted to clerk in the courtroom she had once presided over. She eventually fought her way back as a human rights lawyer, defending women and children in politically charged cases that most lawyers were afraid to represent. She has been arrested and been the target of assassination, but through it all has spoken out with quiet bravery on behalf of the victims of injustice and discrimination and become a powerful voice for change, almost universally embraced as a hero. <br />Her memoir is a gripping story - a must-read for anyone interested in Zara Kazemi's case, in the life of a remarkable woman, or in understandingthe political and religious upheaval in our world.",

Because their real names will reveal their Jewishness, they are renamed \"Hansel\" and \"Gretel.\" They wander in the woods until they are taken in by Magda, an eccentric and stubborn old woman called \"witch\" by the nearby villagers. Magda is determined to save them, even as a German officer arrives in the village with his own plans for the children. Louise Murphy's haunting novel of journey and survival, of redemption and memory, powerfully depicts how war is experienced by families and especially by children.<br /><br />\"Lyrical, haunting, unforgettable.\" --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br /><br />\"No reader who picks up this inspiring novel will put it down until the final pages, in which redemption is not a fairy tale ending but a heartening message of hope.\" --<i>Publishers Weekly</i>",

    "description": "Using small-town life as a springboard to explore the loftiest of ideas, Haven Kimmel\u2019s irresistibly smart and generous first novel is at once a romance and a haunting meditation on grief and faith. Langston Braverman returns to Haddington, Indiana (pop. 3,062) after walking out on an academic career that has equipped her for little but lording it over other people. Amos Townsend is trying to minister to a congregation that would prefer simple affirmations to his esoteric brand of theology.<br /><br />What draws these difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014people together are two wounded little girls who call themselves Immaculata and Epiphany. They are the daughters of Langston\u2019s childhood friend and the witnesses to her murder. And their need for love is so urgent that neither Langston nor Amos can resist it, though they do their best to resist each other. Deftly walking the tightrope between tragedy and comedy, <b>The Solace of Leaving Early</b> is a joyous story about finding one\u2019s better self through accepting the shortcomings of others.",

But for the people of Laramie\u2013both the friends of Matthew and those who hated him without knowing him\u2013the tragedy was personal. In a chorus of voices that brings to mind Thornton Wilder\u2019s <b>Our Town, The Laramie Project</b> allows those most deeply affected to speak, and the result is a brilliantly moving theatrical creation.",

    "description": "GEORG BUCHNERS's (1815-1837) famous play, \"Woyzeck, based on a man who was beheaded in Leipzig in 1824 for slaying his mistress, has traditionally been seen as an important forerunner of the open theatre, leading to Brecht. However, recent German scholarship has finally it made it possible to establish an authentic (previously unavailable) sequence of scenes. Irish translator Dan Farrelly incorporates these changes and demonstrates that the old view of this play as a prime example of loose, open theatre, is no longer sustainable.",

The novel takes place in the space of four days in the life of Bob Jones, a black man who is constantly plagued by the effects of racism. Living in a society that is drenched in race consciousness has no doubt taken a toll on the way Jones behaves, thinks, and feels, especially when, at the end of his story, he is accused of a brutal crime he did not commit. \"One of the most important American writers of the twentieth century ...

In True and False David Mamet overturns conventional opinion and tells aspiring actors what they really need to know. He leaves no aspect of acting untouched: how to judge the role, approach the part, work with the playwright; the right way to undertake auditions and the proper approach to agents and the business in general. True and False slaughters a wide range of sacred cows and yet offers an invaluable guide to the acting profession",

But as the war between good and evil rages, he is summoned back to the mortal realm to protect a woman standing too close to the edge of darkness.<br /><br />Rachel Duncan has never felt this way before. A mysterious man is intent on seducing her with expensive gifts and trips on his private plane, yet it is Derek, a breathtaking stranger, who tugs at her heart. With him, there is laughter, light . . . and love. But Derek tells an impossible, insane story, though deep in her heart she knows it to be true. Now Derek and Rachel must race against time to save the mortal souls of mankind . . . and each other.",

    "description": "With his long black curls, a shadowy family tree, and an affinity for pet spiders, James Matthew bears little resemblance to his starched-collar, blue-blooded peers at Eton. Dubbed King Jas., he stops at nothing to become the most notorious underclassman in the prestigious school's history. For James, sword fighting, falling in love with an Ottoman Sultana, and challenging the Queen of England are all in a day's skullduggery. But when he sets sail on a ship with a mysterious mission, King Jas.' dream of discovering a magical island quickly turns into an unimaginable nightmare.<br /><br />Screenwriter J. V. Hart traces the evolution of J. M. Barrie's classic villain from an eccentric outcast to the scourge of Neverland.",

Into this sinister abode comes the eldest son, Teddy, who, having spent the past six years teaching philosophy in America, is now bringing his wife, Ruth, home to visit the family she has never met. As the play progresses, the younger brothers make increasingly outrageous passes at their sister-in-law until they are practically making love to her in front of her stunned but strangely aloof husband.<br />",

    "description": "With the appearance of his first record album in 1967, Leonard Cohen - already well known in his native Canada as a poet and novelist - was introduced to audiences in the United States, where he quickly took his place among the preeminent singer/songwriters of the time. Over the years, and through the release of eight more albums, Cohen gained a reputation as a dazzlingly literate and consistently daring songwriter. His status as a cult artist grew and solidified, not only in North America but all across Europe; singers of enormously diverse styles recorded his songs; his influence could be charted in every new wave of recording artists that followed his emergence. In 1988 the release of his album I'm Your Man thrust him back into the mainstream spotlight; and his latest recording, The Future, has brought him renewed widespread acclaim as one of our most enduring poet/songwriters. Now Stranger Music brings together, for the first time in one volume, a generous selection of Leonard Cohen's song lyrics and poetry. Stranger Music reveals the range and depth of Cohen's work. And it is a long-overdue celebration of his extraordinary gift for language that speaks with rare clarity, passion, and timelessness.",

    "description": "Tom Stoppers's play \"Jumpers\" is both a high-spirited comedy and a serious attempt to debate the existence of a moral absolute, of metaphysical reality, of God. Michael Billington in \"The Guardian\" described the play succinctly: \"The new Radical Liberal Party has made the ex-Minister of Agriculture Archbishop of Cantebury, British astronauts are scrapping with each other on the moon, and spritely academics steal about London by night indulging in murderous gymnastics: this is the kind of manic, futuristic, topsy-turvy world in which Stoppard's dazzling new play is set. And if I add that the influences apparently include Wittgenstein, Magritte, the Goons, Robert Dhery, Joe Orton, and The Avengers, you will have some idea of the heady brew Stoppard has here concocted.\" The protagonist incude an aging Professor Of Moral Philosophy -- trying to compose a lecture on \"Man -- Good, Bad or Indifferent\" -- while ignoring a corpse in the next room; his beautiful young wife, an ex-musical comedy Queen, lasciviously entertaining his university boss down the hall; her husband's specially trained hare, Thumpers; and a chorus of gymnasts, Jumpers.",

    "description": "The illustrations for this series were created by Scott McKowen, who, with his wife Christina Poddubiuk, operates Punch &amp; Judy Inc., a company specializing in design and illustration for theater and performing arts. Their projects often involve research into the visual aspects of historical settings and characters. Christina is a theater set and costume designer and contributed advice on the period clothing for the illustrations.<br /><br />Scott created these drawings in scratchboard \u00ad an engraving medium which evokes the look of popular art from the period of these stories. Scratchboard is an illustration board with a specifically prepared surface of hard white chalk. A thin layer of black ink is rolled over the surface, and lines are drawn by hand with a sharp knife by scraping through the ink layer to expose the white surface underneath. The finished drawings are then scanned and the color is added digitally.<br /><br />Sneaky pirates, sailing ships, buried treasure, exotic lands, and murderous mutiny: what could be better to win over even the most reluctant boy reader? Robert Louis Stevenson serves up thrills, chills, and plenty of action in this timeless, and much-admired adventure novel.<br />",

    "description": "The remarkable diversity of Christianity during the formative years before the Council of Nicea has become a plain, even natural, \"fact\" for most ancient historians. Until now, however, there has been no sourcebook of primary texts that reveals the many varieties of Christian beliefs, practices, ethics, experiences, confrontations, and self-understandings. To help readers recognize and experience the rich diversity of the early Christian movement, After the New Testament provides a wide range of texts from the second and third centuries, both \"orthodox\" and \"heterodox,\" including such works as the Apostolic Fathers, the writings of Nag Hammadi, early pseudepigrapha, martyrologies, anti-Jewish tractates, heresiologies, canon lists, church orders, liturgical texts, and theological treatises. Rather than providing only fragments of texts, this collection prints large excerpts--entire documents wherever possible--organized under social and historical rubrics. <br /> This unique reader's concise and informative introductions and clear and up-to-date English translations make it ideal for courses on the New Testament, Christian Origins, Early Church History, or Late Antiquity. It will also be of interest to anyone--student, scholar, and general reader alike--interested in the entire range of early Christian literature from the period after the New Testament up to the writings of the so-called father of church history, Eusebius.",

    "description": "\"Travesties\" ws born out of Stoppard's noting that in 1917 three of the twentieth century's most crucial revolutionaries -- James Joyce, the Dadaist founder Tristan Tzara, and Lenin -- were all living in Zurich. Also living in Zurich at this time was a British consula official called Henry Carr, a man acquainted with Joyce through the theater and later through a lawsuit concerning a pair of trousers. Taking Carr as his core, Stoppard spins this historical coincidence into a masterful and riotously funny play, a speculative portrait of what could have been the meeting of these profoundly influential men in a germinal Europe as seen through the lucid, lurid, faulty, and wholy riveting memory of an aging Henry Carr.",

    "description": "<i>Creating True Peace</i> is both a profound work of spiritual guidance and a practical blueprint for peaceful inner change and global change. It is the Venerable Thich Nhat Hanh's answer to our deep-rooted crisis of violence and our feelings of helplessness, victimization, and fear. As a world-renowned writer, scholar, spiritual leader, and Zen Buddhist monk, Thich Nhat Hanh is one of the most visible, revered activists for peace and Engaged Buddhism -- the practice he created that combines mindful living and social action. Having lived through two wars in his native Vietnam, he works to prevent conflict of all kinds -- from the internal violence of individual thoughts to interpersonal and international aggression. <br /> Now, in this new book, perhaps his most important work to date, Thich Nhat Hanh uses a beautiful blend of visionary insight, inspiring stories of peacemaking, and a combination of meditation practices and instruction to show us how to take Right Action. A book for people of all faiths, it is a magnum opus -- a compendium of peace practices that can help anyone practice nonviolent thought and behavior, even in the midst of world upheaval. <br /> More than any of his previous books, <i>Creating True Peace</i> tells stories of Thich Nhat Hanh and his students practicing peace during wartime. These demonstrate that violence is an outmoded response we can no longer afford. The simple, but powerful daily actions and everyday interactions that Thich Nhat Hanh recommends can root out violence where it lives in our hearts and minds and help us discover the power to create peace at every level of life -- personal, family, neighborhood, community, state, nation, and world. <br /> Whether dealing with extreme emotions and challenging situations or managing interpersonal and international conflicts, Thich Nhat Hanh relies on the 2,600-year-old traditional wisdom and scholarship of the Buddha, as well as other great scriptures. He teaches us to look more deeply into our thoughts and lives so that we can know what to do and what not to do to transform them into something better. With a combination of courage, sweetness, and candor, he tells us that we can make a difference; we are not helpless; we can create peace here and now. <i>Creating True Peace</i> shows us how.",

    "description": "East Side, West Side, from the Little Red Lighthouse to Battery Park City, the wonders of Manhattan's waterfront are both celebrated and secret -- hidden in plain sight. In his brilliant exploration of this defining yet neglected shoreline, personal essayist Philip Lopate also recovers a part of the city's soul. <br /><br />A native New Yorker, Lopate has embraced Manhattan by walking every inch of its perimeter, telling stories on the way of pirates (Captain Kidd) and power brokers (Robert Moses), the lowly shipworm and Typhoid Mary, public housing in Harlem and the building of the Brooklyn Bridge. He evokes the magic of the once bustling old port from Melville's and Whitman's day to the era of the longshoremen in <b>On the Waterfront</b>, while appraising today's developers and environmental activists, and probing new plans for parks and pleasure domes with river views. Whether escorting us into unfamiliar, hazardous crannies or along a Beaux Arts esplanade, <b>Waterfront</b> is a grand literary ramble and defense of urban life by one of our most perceptive observers.",

Lahr chronicles Orton's working-class childhood and stagestruck adolescence, the scandals and disasters of his early professional years, and the brief, glittering success of his blistering comedies, <i>Entertaining Mr. Sloane, Loot, and What the Butler Saw.</i><br /><br /><i>Prick Up Your Ears</i> is a watershed biography; it paved the way for Orton's revival and ensured his rightful place in the English repertoire.",

    "description": "Described by its author as 'almost irresponsibly optimistic', Saved is a play set in London in the sixties. Its subject is the cultural poverty and frustration of a generation of young people on the dole and living on council estates. The play was first staged privately in November 1965 at the Royal Court Theatre before members of the English Stage Society in a time when plays were still censored. With its scenes of violence, including the stoning of a baby, Saved became a notorious play and a cause celebre. In a letter to the Observer, Sir Laurence Olivier wrote: 'Saved is not a play for children but it is for grown-ups, and the grown-ups of this country should have the courage to look at it.' Saved has had a marked influence on a whole new generation writing in the 1990s.<br />Edward Bond is \"a great playwright - many, particularly in continental Europe, would say the greatest living English playwright\" (Independent)",

The story famously recounts how the faded and promiscuous Blanche DuBois is pushed over the edge by her sexy and brutal brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski. <i>Streetcar</i> launched the careers of Marlon Brando, Jessica Tandy, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden, and solidified the position of Tennessee Williams as one of the most important young playwrights of his generation, as well as that of Elia Kazan as the greatest American stage director of the \u201940s and \u201950s.",

Emil's entire existence can be summarized as a struggle between two worlds: the show world of illusion (related to the Hindu concept of maya) and the real world, the world of spiritual truth. In the course of the novel, accompanied and prompted by his mysterious classmate 'Max Demian', he detaches from and revolts against the superficial ideals of the world of appearances and eventually awakens into a realization of self.",

    "description": "<i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i> first heated up Broadway in 1955 with its gothic American story of brothers vying for their dying father\u2019s inheritance amid a whirlwind of sexuality, untethered in the person of Maggie the Cat. The play also daringly showcased the burden of sexuality repressed in the agony of her husband, Brick Pollitt. In spite of the public controversy <i>Cat</i> stirred up, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and the Drama Critics Circle Award for that year. Williams, as he so often did with his plays, rewrote <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i> for many years\u2014the present version was originally produced at the American Shakespeare Festival in 1974 with all the changes that made Williams finally declare the text to be definitive, and was most recently produced on Broadway in the 2003\u20132004 season. This definitive edition also includes Williams&amp;rsquoi; essay \u201cPerson-to-Person,\u201d Williams\u2019 notes on the various endings, and a short chronology of the author\u2019s life. One of America\u2019s greatest living playwrights, as well as a friend and colleague of Williams, Edward Albee has written a concise introduction to the play from a playwright\u2019s perspective, examining the candor, sensuality, power, and impact of <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i> then and now.",

A coming of age story about a teenage girl on the frontiers of space.<br /><br />Pella's father, Clement, has just been swept out of elective office in New York and has set his sights on the next political frontier: joining the first human settlers on the Planet of the Archbuilders. Once the domain of a super-evolved alien species who used \"viruses\" to alter their ecosystem before abandoning it, the planet is now a hothouse landscape of ruined towers and refuse inhabited only by skittery, mouselike \"household deer\" and a few remaining Archbuilders.<br /><br />Clement's mission, to forge a community that embraces the Archbuilders, puts him on a collision course with Ephram Nugent, a xenophobic homesteader.",

    "description": "Amy Bloom has won a devoted readership and wide critical acclaim for fiction of rare humor, insight, grace, and eloquence, and the same qualities distinguish <b>Normal</b>, a provocative, intimate journey into the lives of \u201cpeople who reveal, or announce, that their gender is variegated rather than monochromatic\u201d\u2014female-to-male transsexuals, heterosexual crossdressers, and the intersexed. <br /><br /> We meet Lyle Monelle and his mother, Jessie, who recognized early on that her little girl was in fact a boy and used her life savings to help Lyle make the transition. On a Carnival cruise with a group of crossdressers and their spouses, we meet Peggy Rudd and her husband, \u201cMelanie,\u201d who devote themselves to the cause of \u201cordinary heterosexual men with an additional feminine dimension.\u201d And we meet Hale Hawbecker, \u201ca regular, middle-of-the-road, white-bread guy\u201d with a wife, kids, and a medical condition, the standard treatment for which would have changed his life and his gender. <br /><br /> Casting light into the dusty corners of our assumptions about sex, gender and identity, Bloom reveals new facets to the ideas of happiness, personality and character, even as she brilliantly illuminates the very concept of \"normal.\u201d",

Now the Augmented Third Edition adds to the established reputation of this premier academic resource. A wealth of new maps, charts, and diagrams further clarify information found in the scripture pages. In addition, section introductions have been expanded and the book introductions have been made more uniform in order to enhance their utility. Of course, the Augmented Third Edition retains the features prized by students, including single column annotations at the foot of the pages, in-text background essays, charts, and maps, a page number-keyed index of all the study materials in the volume, and Oxford's renowned Bible maps. This timely edition maintains and extends the excellence the Annotated's users have come to expect, bringing still more insights, information, and approaches to bear upon the understanding of the biblical text.",

    "description": "Shaw began writing <i>Man and Superman</i> in 1901 and determined to write a play that would encapsulate the new century's intellectual inheritance. Shaw drew not only on Byron's verse satire, but also on Shakespeare, the Victorian comedy fashionable in his early life, and from authors from Conan Doyle to Kipling. In this powerful drama of ideas, Shaw explores the role of the artist, the function of women in society, and his theory of Creative Evolution. As Stanley Weintraub says in his new introduction, this is \"the first great twentieth-century English play\" and remains a classic expos\u00e9 of the eternal struggle between the sexes.",

    "description": "George Bernard Shaw was born in Dublin in 1856. Before becoming a playwright he wrote music and literary criticism. Shaw used his writing to attack social problems such as education, marriage, religion, government, health care, and class privilege. Shaw was particularly conscious of the exploitation of the working class. Heartbreak House is set in England during a house party at the eccentric upper-class household of the Stover family. This comedy of manners takes a probing look at the conflict between old-fashioned idealism and the realities of the modern age.",

    "description": "\u201cAn elegant page-turner of nineteenth-century detective fiction.\u201d<br />\u2013The Washington Post Book World<br /><br />One rainy morning in 1871 in lower Manhattan, Martin Pemberton a freelance writer, sees in a passing stagecoach several elderly men, one of whom he recognizes as his supposedly dead and buried father. While trying to unravel the mystery, Pemberton disappears, sending McIlvaine, his employer, the editor of an evening paper, in pursuit of the truth behind his freelancer\u2019s fate. Layer by layer, McIlvaine reveals a modern metropolis surging with primordial urges and sins, where the Tweed Ring operates the city for its own profit and a conspicuously self-satisfied nouveau-riche ignores the poverty and squalor that surrounds them. In E. L. Doctorow\u2019s skilled hands, <i>The Waterworks</i> becomes, in the words of <i>The New York Times</i>, \u201ca dark moral tale . . . an eloquently troubling evocation of our past.\u201d",

    "description": "Along with Mother Courage, the character of Galileo is one of Brecht's greatest creations, immensely live, human and complex. Unable to resist his appetite for scientific investigation, Galileo's heretical discoveries about the solar system bring him to the attention of the Inquisition. He is scared into publicly abjuring his theories but, despite his self-contempt, goes on working in private, eventually helping to smuggle his writings out of the country.<br /><br />As an examination of the problems that face not only the scientist but also the whole spirit of free inquiry when brought into conflict with the requirements of government or official ideology, Life of Galileo has few equals.<br /><br />Written in exile in 1937-9 and first performed in Zurich in 1943, Galileo was first staged in English in 1947 by Joseph Losey in a version jointly prepared by Brecht and Charles Laughton, who played the title role. Printed here is the complete translation by John Willett. The much shorter Laughton version is also included in full as an appendix, along with Brecht's own copious notes on the play making this the most trusted scholarly edition of the text.",

    "description": "R\u00eaver de vivre dans un d\u00e9sert. D\u00e9tester tous les hommes, et plus ou moins les femmes... Faire son col\u00e9reux d\u00e8s que l'occasion se pr\u00e9sente. Refuser la moindre concession \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. En un mot, \u00eatre Alceste. Une hauteur d'\u00e2me respectable et qui impose le respect ; mais peut-on fr\u00e9quenter un tel homme sans le railler ? Un dilemme que les autres protagonistes de la com\u00e9die de Moli\u00e8re rencontrent, y compris la coquette C\u00e9lim\u00e8ne.<br />L'accompagnement critique met en place les r\u00e8gles de la grande com\u00e9die et l'usage que Moli\u00e8re en fait. L'acte d'exposition est \u00e9tudi\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail. Les morceaux de bravoure (la tirade d'Alceste, la sc\u00e8ne des portraits) donnent lieu \u00e0 des lectures m\u00e9thodiques. La confrontation de deux frontispices du Misanthrope propose une lecture d'images originale.<br />Com\u00e9die (XVIIe si\u00e8cle) recommand\u00e9e pour les classes de lyc\u00e9e. Texte int\u00e9gral.",

As the eponymous Martin's vision becomes bolder and bolder he walks a haunted line between fantasy and reality, madness and ambition, art and industry, a\u00a0sense of doom builds piece-by-hypnotic piece until this mesmerizing journey into the heart of an American dreamer reaches its bitter-sweet conclusion.",

    "description": "<b>Now updated with new research \u2014 the book that has changed millions of lives.</b><br /><br />After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a <i>fixed mindset</i> \u2014 those who believe that abilities are fixed \u2014 are less likely to flourish than those with a <i>growth mindset</i> \u2014 those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.<br /><br />In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love \u2014 to transform their lives and your own.",

Hobbes' case for a 'common-wealth' under a powerful sovereign - or 'Leviathan' - to enforce security and the rule of law, shocked his contemporaries, and his book was publicly burnt for sedition the moment it was published. But his penetrating work of political philosophy - now fully revised and with a new introduction for this edition - opened up questions about the nature of statecraft and society that influenced governments across the world.",

    "description": "Filled with languid aristocrats trading witticisms as they wait for martinis, this collection of three Noel Coward plays encapsulates the qualities that made him one of the most popular playwrights of the 1930s and '40s and one of the great personalities of the century.<br /><br />In <i>Blithe Spirit</i>, Charles Condomine receives a visit from his first wife, Elvira. Unfortunately, Elvira is now a ghost and Charles has, understandably, moved on and married Ruth.<br /><br />The bohemian protagonists of <i>Hay Fever</i> wreak emotional havoc on a house full of weekend visitors.<br /><br />In <i>Private Lives</i>, a recently divorced couple find themselves in adjoining hotel rooms while on honeymoon with their new spouses.",

    "description": "A glorious novel of the controversial Richard III - a monarch betrayed in life by his allies and betrayed in death by history.<br /><br />In this beautifully rendered modern classic, Sharon Kay Penman redeems Richard III - vilified as the bitter, twisted, scheming\u00a0hunchback who murdered his nephews, the princes in the Tower - from his maligned\u00a0place in history with a\u00a0dazzling combination of research and storytelling.\u00a0<br /><br />Born into\u00a0the treacherous courts of fifteenth-century\u00a0England, in the midst of what history has called The War of the Roses, Richard was raised in the shadow of his charismatic brother, King Edward IV. Loyal to his friends and passionately in love with the one woman who was denied him, Richard emerges as a gifted man far more sinned against than sinning.\u00a0<br /><br />This magnificent retelling of his life is filled with all of the sights and sounds of battle, the customs and lore of the fifteenth century, the rigors of court politics, and the passions and prejudices of royalty.",

    "description": "Hooray for Hollywood? Maybe not. At least not if Peter Farrelly's searingly funny novel is even remotely accurate. Farrelly is a screenwriter and director himself, so the story of aspiring movie scribe Henry Halloran has a scarily authentic feel. When he gives up his job as a salesman in Boston and heads out west to polish and peddle the script he based on a recent breakup, Henry tumbles into a world of bizarre quasi celebrities, breathtakingly unprincipled producers, surgically enhanced starlets, and plain ordinary lunatics. The result is basically an unrelenting nightmare, guest-starring his uninvited roommate, the sister of a woman whose suicide he failed to prevent. <p> Farrelly's master stroke in <i>The Comedy Writer</i> is making Henry as unsympathetic as most of the characters he runs into. This is not the story of a wide-eyed innocent thrown to the Hollywood sharks but of a bitter, frequently nasty hypochondriac who bites off more than he can chew and gradually realizes that almost anything is better than Hollywood's version of success. It's the kind of book that makes you want to take a shower, but you'll still be chuckling as you soap up. <i>--Simon Leake</i></p>",

Her father died unexpectedly, she's failing school, and her best friend is mad at her.

    "description": "A stunning, evocative novel set in Ireland and Canada, <i>Away</i> traces a family\u2019s complex and layered past. The narrative unfolds with shimmering clarity, and takes us from the harsh northern Irish coast in the 1840s to the quarantine stations at Grosse Isle and the barely hospitable land of the Canadian Shield; from the flourishing town of Port Hope to the flooded streets of Montreal; from Ottawa at the time of Confederation to a large-windowed house at the edge of a Great Lake during the present day. Graceful and moving, <i>Away</i> unites the personal and the political as it explores the most private, often darkest corners of our emotions where the things that root us to ourselves endure. Powerful, intricate, lyrical, <i>Away</i> is an unforgettable novel.",

    "description": "\"The Roots of Romanticism\" at last makes available in printed form Isaiah Berlin's most celebrated lecture series, the Mellon lectures, delivered in Washington in 1965, recorded by the BBC, and broadcast several times. A published version has been keenly awaited ever since the lectures were given, and Berlin had always hoped to complete a book based on them. But despite extensive further work this hope was not fulfilled, and the present volume is an edited transcript of his spoken words.For Berlin, the Romantics set in motion a vast, unparalleled revolution in humanity's view of itself. They destroyed the traditional notions of objective truth and validity in ethics with incalculable, all-pervasive results. As he said of the Romantics elsewhere: \"The world has never been the same since, and our politics and morals have been deeply transformed by them. Certainly this has been the most radical, and indeed dramatic, not to say terrifying, change in men's outlook in modern times.\"<br /><br />In these brilliant lectures Berlin surveys the myriad attempts to define Romanticism, distills its essence, traces its developments from its first stirrings to its apotheosis, and shows how its lasting legacy permeates our own outlook. Combining the freshness and immediacy of the spoken word with Berlin's inimitable eloquence and wit, the lectures range over a cast of the greatest thinkers and artists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including Kant, Rousseau, Diderot, Schiller, Schlegel, Novalis, Goethe, Blake, Byron, and Beethoven. Berlin argues that the ideas and attitudes held by these and other figures helped to shape twentieth-century nationalism, existentialism, democracy, totalitarianism,and our ideas about heroic individuals, individual self-fulfillment, and the exalted place of art. This is the record of an intellectual bravura performance--of one of the century's most influential philosophers dissecting and assessing a movement that changed the course of history.",

He goes \"out in the sort\" among the machines that process a million packages a day at UPS Air's distribution hub at Louisville International Airport.

    "description": "As web browsers have become more capable and standards compliant, JavaScript has grown in prominence. JavaScript lets designers add sparkle and life to web pages, while more complex JavaScript has led to the rise of Ajax -- the latest rage in web development that allows developers to create powerful and more responsive applications in the browser window.<br /><br />\"Learning JavaScript\" introduces this powerful scripting language to web designers and developers in easy-to-understand terms. Using the latest examples from modern browser development practices, this book teaches you how to integrate the language with the browser environment, and how to practice proper coding techniques for standards-compliant web sites. By the end of the book, you'll be able to use all of the JavaScript language and many of the object models provided by web browsers, and you'll even be able to create a basic Ajax application.",

She not only has her own memory of holding the gun, but her father's account of the event. Now fourteen, she yearns for her mother, and for forgiveness. Living on a peach farm in South Carolina with her father, she has only one friend: Rosaleen, a black servant whose sharp exterior hides a tender heart. South Carolina in the sixties is a place where segregation is still considered a cause worth fighting for. When racial tension explodes one summer afternoon, and Rosaleen is arrested and beaten, Lily is compelled to act. Fugitives from justice and from Lily's harsh and unyielding father, they follow a trail left by the woman who died ten years before. Finding sanctuary in the home of three beekeeping sisters, Lily starts a journey as much about her understanding of the world, as about the mystery surrounding her mother.",

    "description": "Like <i>Brick Lane</i> and <i>The Kite Runner</i>, Camilla Gibb's widely praised new novel is a poignant and intensely atmospheric look beyond the stereotypes of Islam. After her hippie British parents are murdered, Lilly is raised at a Sufi shrine in Morocco. As a young woman she goes on pilgrimage to Harar, Ethiopia, where she teaches Qur'an to children and falls in love with an idealistic doctor. But even swathed in a traditional headscarf, Lilly can't escape being marked as a foreigner. Forced to flee Ethiopia for England, she must once again confront the riddle of who she is and where she belongs.",

A despotic post-US government decides to colonise this precious find and constructs the starship Alabama. The ship is about to launch when it is hijacked by its own crew. Instead of the intended party loyalists it is populated with malcontents and social dissidents who must learn to work together in the struggle to reach and then conquer their prize: Coyote. Vast in scope, passionate in its conviction, and set against a backdrop of completely plausible events, Coyote tells the story of Earth's first extra-solar colonists, and the mysterious planet that becomes their home.",

Spanning more than seven decades, from the turn of the century to the mid-seventies, <b>The Underpainter</b>--in range, in the sheer power of its prose, and in its brilliant depiction of landscape and the geography of imagination--is <b>Jane Urquhart</b>'s most accomplished novel to date, with one of the most powerful climaxes in contemporary fiction.",

    "description": "Vikram Lall comes of age in 1950s Kenya, at the same time that the colony is struggling towards independence. Against the unsettling backdrop of Mau Mau violence, Vic and his sister Deepa, the grandchildren of an Indian railroad worker, search for their place in a world sharply divided between Kenyans and the British. We follow Vic from a changing Africa in the fifties, to the hope of the sixties, and through the corruption and fear of the seventies and eighties. Hauntingly told in the voice of the now exiled Vic, <b>The In-Between World of Vikram Lall </b>is an acute and bittersweet novel of identity and family, of lost love and abiding friendship, and of the insidious legacy of the British Empire.",

    "description": "Thomas Hardy once said that America had two great attractions: the skyscraper and the poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay. The most famous poet of the Jazz Age, Millay captivated the nation: She smoked in public, took many lovers (men and women, single and married), flouted convention sensationally, and became the embodiment of the New Woman.<br /><br />Thirty years after her landmark biography of Zelda Fitzgerald, Nancy Milford returns with an iconic portrait of this passionate, fearless woman who obsessed America even as she tormented herself. <br /><br />Chosen by <i>USA Today</i> as one of the top ten books of the year, <i>Savage Beauty</i> is a triumph in the art of biography. Millay was an American original--one of those rare characters, like Sylvia Plath and Ernest Hemingway, whose lives were even more dramatic than their art.",

    "description": "<i>Memory, Ji Bai would say, is this old sack here, this poor dear that nobody has any use for any more.<br /></i><br />As the novel begins, Salim Juma, in exile from Tanzania, opens up a gunny sack bequeathed to him by a beloved great-aunt. Inside it he discovers the past \u2014 his own family\u2019s history and the story of the Asian experience in East Africa. Its relics and artefacts bring with them the lives of Salim\u2019s Indian great-grandfather, Dhanji Govindji, his extensive family, and all their loves and betrayals.<br /><br />Dhanji Govindji arrives in Matamu \u2014 from Zanzibar, Porbander, and ultimately Junapur \u2014 and has a son with an African slave named Bibi Taratibu. Later, growing in prosperity, he marries Fatima, the woman who will bear his other children. But when his half-African son Husein disappears, Dhanji Govindji pays out his fortune in trying to find him again. As the tentacles of the First World War reach into Africa, with the local German colonists fighting British invaders, he spends more and more time searching. One morning he is suddenly murdered: he had spent not just his own money but embezzled that of others to finance the quest for his lost son.<br /><br /><i>\u201cWell, listen, son of Juma, you listen to me and I shall give you your father Juma and his father Husein and his father\u2026\u201d <br /></i><br />Part II of the novel is named for Kulsum, who marries Juma, Husein\u2019s son; she is the mother of the narrator, Salim. We learn of Juma\u2019s childhood as a second-class member of his stepmother\u2019s family after his mother, Moti, dies. After his wedding to Kulsum there is a long wait in the unloving bosom of his stepfamily for their first child, Begum. It is the 1950s, and whispers are beginning of the Mau Mau rebellion.<br /><br />Among the stories tumbling from the gunny sack comes the tailor Edward bin Hadith\u2019s story of the naming of Dar es Salaam, the city Kulsum moves to with her children after her husband\u2019s death. And gradually her son takes over the telling, recalling his own childhood. His life guides the narrative from here on. He remembers his mother\u2019s store and neighbours\u2019 intrigues, the beauty of his pristine English teacher at primary school, cricket matches, and attempts to commune with the ghost of his father. It is a vibrantly described, deeply felt childhood. The nation, meanwhile, is racked by political tensions on its road to independence, which comes about as Salim Juma reaches adolescence. With the surge in racial tension and nationalist rioting, several members of his close-knit community leave the country for England, America, and Canada.<br /><br /><i>I see this comedy now as an attempt to foil the workings of fate: how else to explain, what else to call, the irrevocable relentless chain of events that unfolded\u2026<br /></i><br />The title of Part III, Amina, is the name of Salim\u2019s great unfulfilled love, and will also be the name of his daughter. He meets the first Amina while doing his National Service at Camp Uhuru, a place he feels he has been sent to in error. Amina is African, and their relationship inevitably causes his family anxiety, until the increasingly militant Amina leaves for New York. Salim becomes a teacher at his old school, and marries, but keeps a place for Amina in his heart. When she returns and is arrested by the more and more repressive government, Salim is hurriedly exiled abroad. He leaves his wife and daughter with the promise that he will send for them, knowing that he will not. The novel ends with Salim alone, the last memories coming out of the gunny sack, hoping that he will be his family\u2019s last runaway.",

    "description": "On vacation from school, Denis goes to stay at Crome, an English country house inhabited by several of Huxley's most outlandish characters--from Mr. Barbecue-Smith, who writes 1,500 publishable words an hour by \"getting in touch\" with his \"subconscious,\" to Henry Wimbush, who is obsessed with writing the definitive \"History of Crome.\" Denis's stay proves to be a disaster amid his weak attempts to attract the girl of his dreams and the ridicule he endures regarding his plan to write a novel about love and art. Lambasting the post-Victorian standards of morality, <i>Crome Yellow</i> is a witty masterpiece that, in F. Scott Fitzgerald's words, \"is too ironic to be called satire and too scornful to be called irony.\"",

    "description": "At the age of five, Grania-the daughter of hardworking Irish hoteliers in smalltown Ontario-emerges from a bout of scarlet fever profoundly deaf and is suddenly sealed off from the world that was just beginning to open for her. Her guilt-plagued mother cannot accept her daughter's deafness. Grania's saving grace is her grandmother Mamo, who tries to teach Grania to read and speak again. Grania's older sister, Tress, is a beloved ally as well-obliging when Grania begs her to shout words into her ear canals and forging a rope to keep the sisters connected from their separate beds at night when Grania fears the terrible vulnerability that darkness brings. When it becomes clear that she can no longer thrive in the world of the hearing, her family sends her to live at the Ontario School for the Deaf in Belleville, where, protected from the often-unforgiving hearing world outside, she learns sign language and speech.<br /><br />After graduation Grania stays on to work at the school, and it is there that she meets Jim Lloyd, a hearing man. In wonderment the two begin to create a new emotional vocabulary that encompasses both sound and silence. But just two weeks after their wedding, Jim must leave home to serve as a stretcher bearer on the blood-soaked battlefields of Flanders.<br /><br />During this long war of attrition, Jim and Grania's letters back and forth-both real and imagined-attempt to sustain their young love in a world as brutal as it is beautiful. Frances Itani's depiction of a world where sound exists only in the margins is a singular feat in literary fiction, a place difficult to leave and even harder to forget. <br /><br />A magnificent tale of love and war, <i>Deafening</i> is finally an ode to language-how it can console, imprison, and liberate, and how it alone can bridge vast chasms of geography and experience.",

Following a series of expeditions made under the order of the British Crown, the reader witnesses the tragic fallout from these missions as the Beothuk vanish and the web of secrets guarded by the settlers slowly begin to unravel ... Told in elegant sensual prose this is an enthralling historical novel of great passion and suspense, driven by the extraordinary cast of characters. And with it Michael Crummey establishes himself as one of Canada's most exciting new talents.",

As a teenager, she starved herself almost to death, and though outwardly healed, inwardly she remains dangerously obsessed with food. For Joseph Zimmerman, Ruth's tormented relationship with eating is a source of deep distress and erotic fascination. Driven by his love for Ruth, and haunted by his own secrets, Joseph sets out to unravel the mystery of hunger and denial. This gripping debut novel is a powerful exploration of appetite, love, and desire.",

    "description": "<b>Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Great New Writers</b><br /><i>A Blade of Grass</i> is a graceful and stunning epic set in 1970s South Africa, on a remote farm owned by a newly married couple. The mistress of the house, Marit, is young, recently orphaned, easily intimidated, and unaccustomed to rural life. With no close neighbors or friends, Marit feels isolated in the house while her husband works in the fields all day. Marit's displacement is soon echoed in the character of Tembi, the daughter of Marit's household maid, who assumes her mother's responsibilities in the farmhouse after she is hit by a car.<br /><br />An encroaching civil war soon threatens the tranquility of the farm, and before long a plague of violence descends. Abandoned by the other farm workers, the care of the farm is now left to Marit and Tembi, who begin this new struggle for survival as equals, but whose unity is put to a devastating test.<br /><br />DeSoto paints an unforgettable portrait of South Africa with tensions, both political and sexual, simmering underneath. Recalling J. M. Coetzee's <i>Disgrace</i> in his portrayal of Apartheid, DeSoto explodes onto the literary scene with a first novel of tremendous power and literary skill. His description of a terrifying world gone awry holds at its center a deep understanding of the patience of the land, and the enduring hope for renewal.",

    "description": "The gruff widower Holland has two possessions he cherishes above all others: <br /><br />his sprawling property of eucalyptus trees and his ravishingly beautiful daughter, Ellen. <br /><br />When Ellen turns nineteen Holland makes an announcement: she may marry only the man who can correctly name the species of each of the hundreds of gum trees on his property. <br /><br />Ellen is uninterested in the many suitors who arrive from around the world, until one afternoon she chances on a strange, handsome young man resting under a Coolibah tree. In the days that follow, he spins dozens of tales set in cities, deserts, and faraway countries. As the contest draws to a close, Ellen and the stranger's meetings become more erotic, the stories more urgent. Murray Bail's rich narrative is filled with unexpected wisdom about art, feminine beauty, landscape, and language.<i> Eucalyptus</i> is a shimmering love story that affirms the beguiling power of storytelling itself.",

    "description": "<b>A highly entertaining and indispensable manual on how to write good fiction</b><br /><br /><i>If you want to write at all, whether from real life or not, you must be willing and able to use your imagination. That means you must be willing to take risks and sometimes look the fool. You must be willing to transform experience, not simply record it. If you were a good liar, daydreamer, or troublemaker as a child, you'll probably make a good fiction writer. Daydreams, lies, and trouble. That's the stuff of fiction.</i><br /><b>\n  <i></i>\n</b><br /><b>\n  <i></i>\n</b>In <i>Turning Life into Fiction</i>, Robin Hemley offers a highly entertaining and in-depth manual\u2014with writing exercises on how to convert real life into good storytelling. He covers a wide range of subjects, including how to record and generate ideas from daily life and how to write effectively using true anecdotes, real places, and real people. A self-proclaimed liar and thief, Hemley also addresses the legal and ethical concerns of \"borrowing\" experience from the lives of strangers and loved ones.<br /><br />Lively, informative, and inspirational, <i>Turning Life into Fiction </i>is an invaluable text for any fiction writer. First published in 1994, this new edition is updated and expanded to include nearly a dozen short stories that Hemley refers to throughout<br />the book.",

Mugezi's hard-won observations form a cri de coeur for a people shaped by untold losses.",

    "description": "The new novel from one of the greatest twentieth-century writers. Doris Lessing returns to the world of visionary fiction, last visited in her acclaimed 'Canopus in Argos' quintet of novels in the 1980s. It is sooner than you might think. And the earth's climate is much changed -- it's colder than ever before in the north, and unbearably dry and hot in the south. Mara, who is seven, and her four-year-old brother Dann find themselves somewhere very strange, not home... They are taken in by a kindly, grandmotherly woman, but this new life is hard: hunger, dirt, thirst and danger are the children's constant companions. Drought and fire carry off their adoptive home and force them to set off northward into the unknown, to experience a series of adventures that bring them through to an altogether altered world, where they can start to learn and build anew. Doris Lessing has written a compelling, troubling and entertaining novel that, through the remarkable odyssey of a brother and sister living in the imagined future, manages to tell us a great deal about the present we only dimly perceive and scarcely know how to value.",

While around them crime and unrest surge, the Lovatts are certain that their old-fashioned contentment can protect them from the world outside\u2014until the birth of their fifth baby. Gruesomely goblin-like in appearance, insatiably hungry, abnormally strong and violent, Ben has nothing innocent or infant-like about him. As he grows older and more terrifying, Harriet finds she cannot love him, David cannot bring himself to touch him, and their four older children are afraid of him. Understanding that he will never be accepted anywhere, Harriet and David are torn between their instincts as parents and their shocked reaction to this fierce and unlovable child whose existence shatters their belief in a benign world.",

    "description": "An eye-opening examination of the hookup culture, seen through the personal experiences of high school-and college-age women who confront the hard lessons of dating, love, and sex. We're living in an increasingly sexualized world, and it's the young-particularly young women-who must deal with the consequences. Kids are having more sexual contact than ever, and at an earlier age. They call it \"hooking up.\" But what is \"hooking up\"? According to Laura Sessions Stepp, a reporter at \"The Washington Post,\" hooking up eludes a neat definition. It can be anything from an innocent kiss to sexual. In \"Unhooked,\" Stepp follows three groups of young women (one in high school, one each at Duke and George Washington universities). She sat with them in class, socialized with them, listened to them talk, and came away with some disturbing insights, including that hooking up carries with it no obligation on either side. Relationships and romance are seen as messy and time-consuming, and love is postponed-or worse, seen as impossible. Some young women can handle this, but many can't, and they're being battered-physically and emotionally-by the new dating landscape. The result is a generation of young people stymied by relationships and unsure where to turn for help. \"The need to be connected intimately to others is as central to our well-being as food and shelter,\" Stepp writes in \"Unhooked.\" \"In my view, if we don't get it right, we're probably not going to get anything else in life right.\"",

    "description": "Finalist for <i>ForeWord Magazine</i> 1999 Poetry Book of the Year<br /><br /> With rapid shifts between subject and tone, sometimes within single poems, Dean Young\u2019s latest book explores the kaleidoscopic welter of art and life. Here parody does not exclude the <i>cri de coeur</i> any more than seriousness excludes the joke. With surrealist volatility, these poems are the result of experiments that continue for the reader during each reading. Young moves from reworkings of creation myths, the index of the <i>Norton Anthology of Poetry</i>, pseudo reports and memos, collaged biographies, talking clouds, and worms, to memory, mourning, sexual playfulness, and deep sadness in the course of this turbulent book.",

Traveling with a male friend, in the guise of a couple on their honeymoon, Wearing set out on her own at every available opportunity. She went looking for what lay beneath the media's representation of Iran and found a country made up of welcoming, curious, warmhearted, ambitious men and women. With humor and compassion, Wearing gives Iranians the chance to wander beyond headlines and stereotypes, and in doing so, reveals the poetry of their lives--those whose lives extend beyond Western news stories of kidnapping, terrorism, veiled women, and Islamic fundamentalism.",

    "description": "Out of the rich culture of India and the brutal drama of the 1947 Partition comes this lush and eloquent debut novel about two women married to the same man.<br /><br />Roop is a young girl whose mother has died and whose father is deep in debt. So <br />she is elated to learn she is to become the second wife of a wealthy Sikh landowner in a union beneficial to both. For Sardaji\u2019s first wife, Satya, has failed to bear him children. Roop believes that she and Satya, still very much in residence, will be friends. But the relationship between the older and younger woman is far more complex. And, as India lurches toward independence, Sardarji struggles to find his place amidst the drastic changes.<br /><br />Meticulously researched and beautifully written, <b>What the Body Remembers</b> is at once poetic, political, feminist, and sensual.",

    "description": "<i>War and Peace</i> broadly focuses on Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812 and follows three of the most well-known characters in literature: Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count who is fighting for his inheritance and yearning for spiritual fulfillment; Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, who leaves his family behind to fight in the war against Napoleon; and Natasha Rostov, the beautiful young daughter of a nobleman who intrigues both men. <br /><br />As Napoleon's army invades, Tolstoy brilliantly follows characters from diverse backgrounds\u2014peasants and nobility, civilians and soldiers\u2014as they struggle with the problems unique to their era, their history, and their culture. And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most moving\u2014and human\u2014figures in world literature.",

    "description": "Originally published as <b>Hokkaido Highway Blues</b>, with limited distribution in Canada, Will Ferguson\u2019s classic book about Japan, for all fans of the bestselling <b>Beauty Tips from Moose Jaw</b>.<br /><br />With the same fervour they have for outlandish game shows and tiny gadgets, the Japanese go nuts each spring when the cherry blossoms sweep from island to island towards the country\u2019s northerly tip. Will Ferguson was celebrating the event in the standard fashion. And after way too much sake he announced he would be the first person in recorded history to follow the blossom\u2019s progress end to end. To make it a challenge worth doing, he\u2019d hitchhike all the way: relying on the kindness of some very weird and wonderful strangers.<br /><br />Mixing his penchant for biting observation with wicked humour, Ferguson starts at the southernmost tip of Cape Sata and heads north for distant Hokkaido. Whether he is doing the forbidden and not knowing it, or holding \"conversations by non sequitur,\" it is a journey full of misadventures and revelations. The resulting travelogue is one of the funniest and most illuminating books ever written about Japan.<br /><br /><br /><i>To make matters worse, I decided to hitchhike. Striking a heroic stance, I declared my intention to my Japanese friends to become the first person ever to hitchhike the length of Japan, end-to-end, cape-to-cape, sea-to-sea. This did not impress them as much as I had hoped.<br /><br />\u201cWhy would you want to do that?\u201d they asked, genuinely puzzled. \u201cThere is no reason to hitchhike. That\u2019s why we built the Bullet Train.\u201d<br /><br />Others worried about my safety. \u201cBut,\u201d I would argue, \u201cJapan is a very safe country, is it not?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cOh, yes. Very safe. Safest in the world.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cSo why shouldn\u2019t I hitchhike?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cBecause Japan is dangerous.\u201d<br /><br />And so on.<br /><br />Now, I will admit that mooching rides across Japan is not a major achievement \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s not like I paddled up the Amazon or discovered insulin or anything \u2014 but I am the first person ever to do this, so allow me my hubris.<br /><br />When I left my home in Minamata City aboard a southbound train, I felt suitably bold with my backpack and muscular thumb. <br /><br />\u201cI\u2019m going to hitchhike the length of Japan,\u201d I told the man beside me.<br /><br />He smiled and nodded.<br /><br />\u201cI\u2019m going to follow the cherry blossoms.\u201d<br /><br />He nodded.<br /><br />\u201cAll the way to Russia,\u201d I said.<br /><br />He smiled again, and soon after changed seats.<br /></i>\u2014from <b>Hitching Rides with Buddha</b><br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "He was known as \"the Leopard,\" and for the thirty-two years of his reign Mobutu Sese Seko, president of Zaire, showed all the cunning of his namesake, seducing Western powers, buying up the opposition, and dominating his people with a devastating combination of brutality and charm. While the population was pauperized, he plundered the country's copper and diamond resources, downing pink champagne in his jungle palace like some modern-day reincarnation of Joseph Conrad's crazed station manager.<br /><br />Michela Wrong, a correspondent who witnessed firsthand Mobutu's last days, traces the rise and fall of the idealistic young journalist who became the stereotype of an African despot. Engrossing, highly readable, and as funny as it is tragic, her book assesses how Belgium's King Leopold, the CIA, and the World Bank all helped to bring about the disaster that is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. If, in this poignant account, the villains are the \"Big Vegetables\" (<i>les Grosses l\u00e9gumes</i>) \u2014 the fat cats who benefited from Mobutu's largesse \u2014 the heroes are the ordinary citizens trapped in a parody of a state. Living in the shadow of a disintegrating nuclear reactor, where banknotes are not worth the paper they are printed on, they have turned survival into an art form. For all its valuable insights into Africa's colonial heritage and the damage done by Western intervention, <i>In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz</i> is ultimately a celebration of the irrepressible human spirit.",

    "description": "It's the boom years of the 1980s, and life is closing in on Nathan Seltzer, who rarely travels beyond his suddenly gentrifying Lower East Side neighborhood in New York City. Between paralyzing bouts of claustrophobia, Nathan wonders whether he should cheat on his wife with Karoline, a German pastry maker whose parents may or may not have been Nazis. His father, Harry, is plotting with the 1960s boogaloo star Chow Mein Vega for the comeback of this dance craze. Meanwhile, a homicidal drug addict is terrorizing the neighborhood.<br />With its cast of unforgettable characters, Boogaloo on 2nd Avenue is a comedy of cultures, of the old and the new. It's about struggling to hold on to life in a rapidly changing world, about food and sex, and about how our lives are shaped by love and guilt.",

    "description": "Nearly a decade ago Frank McCourt became an unlikely star when, at the age of sixty-six, he burst onto the literary scene with <i>Angela's Ashes,</i> the Pulitzer Prize -- winning memoir of his childhood in Limerick, Ireland. Then came <i>'Tis,</i> his glorious account of his early years in New York.<br /><br />Now, here at last, is McCourt's long-awaited book about how his thirty-year teaching career shaped his second act as a writer. <i>Teacher Man</i> is also an urgent tribute to teachers everywhere. In bold and spirited prose featuring his irreverent wit and heartbreaking honesty, McCourt records the trials, triumphs and surprises he faces in public high schools around New York City. His methods anything but conventional, McCourt creates a lasting impact on his students through imaginative assignments (he instructs one class to write \"An Excuse Note from Adam or Eve to God\"), singalongs (featuring recipe ingredients as lyrics), and field trips (imagine taking twenty-nine rowdy girls to a movie in Times Square!).<br /><br />McCourt struggles to find his way in the classroom and spends his evenings drinking with writers and dreaming of one day putting his own story to paper. <i>Teacher Man</i> shows McCourt developing his unparalleled ability to tell a great story as, five days a week, five periods per day, he works to gain the attention and respect of unruly, hormonally charged or indifferent adolescents. McCourt's rocky marriage, his failed attempt to get a Ph.D. at Trinity College, Dublin, and his repeated firings due to his propensity to talk back to his superiors ironically lead him to New York's most prestigious school, Stuyvesant High School, where he finally finds a place and a voice. \"Doggedness,\" he says, is \"not as glamorous as ambition or talent or intellect or charm, but still the one thing that got me through the days and nights.\"<br /><br />For McCourt, storytelling itself is the source of salvation, and in <i>Teacher Man</i> the journey to redemption -- and literary fame -- is an exhilarating adventure.",

It throws light on many problems plaguing the postwar world, and traces them back to the age-old conflict between Pagan Fatalism and Christian Freedom. Weaver's classic work remains one of the finest discussions of the impact of business on society and shows how the real story of American business can and should be told. For anyone who believes that human liberty is the mainspring of progress, this book discusses highly controversial subjects and leads to certain conclusions that are contrary to much of present-day thinking.",

But a sudden tragedy forces Esperanza and Mama to flee to California during the Great Depression, and to settle in a camp for Mexican farm workers. Esperanza isn't ready for the hard labor, financial struggles, or lack of acceptance she now faces. When their new life is threatened, Esperanza must find a way to rise above her difficult circumstances--Mama's life, and her own, depend on it.",

    "description": "Chris Ayres is a small-town boy, a hypochondriac, and a neat freak with an anxiety disorder. Not exactly the picture of a war correspondent. But when his boss asks him if he would like to go to Iraq, he doesn't have the guts to say no. After signing a 1 million dollar life-insurance policy, studying a tutorial on repairing severed limbs, and spending 20 thousand dollars in camping gear (only to find out that his bright yellow tent makes him a sitting duck), Ayres is embedded with a battalion of gung ho Marines who either shun him or threaten him when he files an unfavorable story. As time goes on, though, he begins to understand them (and his inexplicably enthusiastic fellow war reporters) more and more: Each night of terrifying combat brings, in the morning, something more visceral than he has ever experienced -- the thrill of having won a fight for survival.<br /><br />In the tradition of <i>MASH, Catch-22, </i> and other classics in which irreverence springs from life in extremis, <i>War Reporting for Cowards</i> tells the story of Iraq in a way that is extraordinarily honest, heartfelt, and bitterly hilarious.<br />",

    "description": "Thick with suspense and simmering with adolescent turmoil, <i>Bad Girls</i> is an action-adventure survival story that pits a group of troubled teens against a forbidding tropical landscape, an elusive enemy, and, worst of all, each other. It's Mean Girls meets Lord of the Flies, and it marks the debut of an innovative new voice in fiction. <br /><br /> Anna Wheeler's parents have had it up to here. They can't seem to control their daughter anymore and so, one night, Anna's yanked from her bed and carted off to Camp Archstone -- bootcamp for troubled teen girls. There, on a vast, remote, sparsely populated island, Anna will be expected to change her ways and repent for the sins her religious father just can't seem to forgive. Here's a hint: There's a boy involved. No, a man. <br /> Life at Camp Archstone is Anna's worst nightmare. Every minute of the day is scheduled, the counselors are hardcore, and one girl is crueler than the next. But when a grueling hike into the forest goes horribly wrong, things go from bad to worse. Stalked by an unknown foe and left to fend for themselves, the girls band together to try to find their way back to civilization -- and that's when the real trouble begins.",

In \u201cApples,\u201d a boy comes to terms with the complex world of adults, his first pangs of love, and the bizarre death of his Bible coach. \u201cThe Jesus Stories\u201d examines a people trying to accelerate the Second Coming by telling the story of Christ in every possible way. And in the O. Henry Award winning \u201cThe Ceiling,\u201d a man\u2019s marriage begins to disintegrate after the sky starts slowly descending.<br /><br />Achingly beautiful and deceptively simple, <b>Things That Fall from the Sky</b> defies gravity as one of the most original story collections seen in recent years.",

    "description": "A Top Ten Nonfiction Book of 2005 (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>)<br /><br />For any woman who has ever had a love/hate relationship with food and with how she looks; for anyone who has knowingly or unconsciously used food to try to fill the hole in his heart or soothe the craggy edges of his psyche, <i>Fat Girl</i> is a brilliantly rendered, angst-filled coming-of-age story of gain and loss. From the lush descriptions of food that call to mind the writings of M.F.K. Fisher at her finest, to the heartbreaking accounts of Moore's deep longing for family and a sense of belonging and love, <i>Fat Girl </i>stuns and shocks, saddens and tickles.<br /><br />\"Searingly honest without affectation... Moore emerged from her hellish upbringing as a kind of softer Diane Arbus, wielding pen instead of camera.\"--<i>The Seattle Times</i><br /><br />\"Frank, often funny--intelligent and entertaining.\"--<i>People</i> (starred review)<br /><br />\"God, I love this book. It is wise, funny, painful, revealing, and profoundly honest.\"--Anne Lamott<br /><br />\"Judith Moore grabs the reader by the collar, and shakes up our notion of life in the fat lane.\"--David Sedaris<br /><br />\"Stark... lyrical, and often funny, Judith Moore ambushes you on the very first page, and in short order has lifted you up and broken your heart.\"--<i>Newsweek</i><br /><br />\"A slap-in-the-face of a book--courageous, heartbreaking, fascinating, and darkly funny.\"--Augusten Burroughs",

There is a plot (of sorts), one of revenge surrounding a doctor who, in removing a bone spur from our narrator, manages to amputate a ring and index finger, a significant surgical error considering that the narrator is, or was, a violinist. When Dr. Roak is released from prison, our narrator escapes in order to begin the pursuit, and thus begins a digressive journey from Afghanistan to Venice, then on to India and Morocco and France. All of this takes place amid Mathews's fictional concern and play with games, puzzles, arcana, and stories within stories.",

    "description": "At a dinner party hosted by a wealthy New Yorker, a guest receives a gold adze, the coveted prize in a worm race. When the man dies the next day, he bequeaths, according to a stipulation in his will, the bulk of his fortune to the adze's possessor, provided he answer three mysterious questions relating to the artifact's history. In his search the owner encounters a menagerie of eccentric personalities: an ancient revolutionary in a Parisian prison, a ludicrous pair of gibberish-speaking brothers, and customs officials who spend their time reading contraband materials. He soon finds himself immersed in the centuries-long history of a persecuted religious sect and in an odyssey that begins in a forgotten fog-covered town in Scotland and ends on the ocean floor off the cost of an uncharted French island.<br /><br />A wild goose chase through a remarkably unusual world, \"The Conversions\" invites both reader and protagonist to participate in a quest for answers to an elusive game.",

          "description": "Bunnicula is a children's book series written by James Howe (and his late wife Deborah in the case of the first book, \"Bunnicula\") about a vampire bunny that sucks the juice out of vegetables. \n    \n    The story is centered on the Monroe family and their pets and is told from the perspective of their dog Harold. The Monroes find a bunny at the theater where they were watching a Dracula film. Because of this, they name him Bunnicula. Their cat Chester, however, is convinced Bunnicula is a vampire and attempts to get Harold to help save the Monroes from the perceived menace.\n    \n    Following the end of the Bunnicula series, James Howe began a spin-off series called <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/42323-tales-from-the-house-of-bunnicula\">Tales from the House of Bunnicula</a>, which are 'written' by Howie, the dachshund puppy introduced into the series in Howliday Inn. There is also a series called <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/42743-bunnicula-and-friends\">Bunnicula and Friends</a>. They are a series of picture books about adventures of the characters from the stories. They are aimed for beginning readers.  There's also another series, <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/41910-harold-chester\">Harold & Chester</a>, that are similar to the picture books, but are slightly longer.",

    "description": "This \"deeply moving book\" (Studs Terkel) portrays the Japanese experience of WWII. This oral history is the first book to capture--in either Japanese or English--the experience of ordinary Japanese during the war. In a sweeping panorama, Haruko Taya Cook &amp; Theodore F.

    "description": "It is April 1204, and Constantinople, the splendid capital of the Byzantine Empire, is being sacked and burned by the knights of the Fourth Crusade. Amid the carnage and confusion, one Baudolino saves a historian and high court official from certain death at the hands of the crusading warriors and proceeds to tell his own fantastical story.<br /><br />Born a simple peasant in northern Italy, Baudolino has two major gifts-a talent for learning languages and a skill in telling lies. When still a boy he meets a foreign commander in the woods, charming him with his quick wit and lively mind. The commander-who proves to be Emperor Frederick Barbarossa-adopts Baudolino and sends him to the university in Paris, where he makes a number of fearless, adventurous friends.<br /><br />Spurred on by myths and their own reveries, this merry band sets out in search of Prester John, a legendary priest-king said to rule over a vast kingdom in the East-a phantasmagorical land of strange creatures with eyes on their shoulders and mouths on their stomachs, of eunuchs, unicorns, and lovely maidens. <br /><br />With dazzling digressions, outrageous tricks, extraordinary feeling, and vicarious reflections on our postmodern age, this is Eco the storyteller at his brilliant best.",

    "description": "On the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of its first publication, here is the definitive edition of the book acclaimed as \u201cthe most affecting and successful narrative ever done about the Holocaust\u201d (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>) and \u201cthe first masterpiece in comic book history\u201d (<i>The New Yorker</i>).<br /><i>\n  <br /></i>The Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>Maus</i> tells the story of Vladek Spiegelman, a Jewish survivor of Hitler\u2019s Europe, and his son, a cartoonist coming to terms with his father\u2019s story. <i>Maus</i> approaches the unspeakable through the diminutive. Its form, the cartoon (the Nazis are cats, the Jews mice), shocks us out of any lingering sense of familiarity and succeeds in \u201cdrawing us closer to the bleak heart of the Holocaust\u201d (<i>The New York Times</i>).<br /><br /><i>Maus </i>is a haunting tale within a tale. Vladek\u2019s harrowing story of survival is woven into the author\u2019s account of his tortured relationship with his aging father. Against the backdrop of guilt brought by survival, they stage a normal life of small arguments and unhappy visits. This astonishing retelling of our century\u2019s grisliest news is a story of survival, not only of Vladek but of the children who survive even the survivors. <i>Maus </i>studies the bloody pawprints of history and tracks its meaning for all of us.",

    "description": "The classical civilizations of Greece &amp; Rome once dominated the world. They continue to fascinate &amp; inspire us. Classical art &amp; architecture, drama &amp; epic, philosophy &amp; politics--these are the foundations of Western civilization. In <i>The Classical World</i>, eminent classicist Robin Lane Fox chronicles this vast sweep of history from Homer to the reign of Augustus. From the Peloponnesian War thru the creation of Athenian democracy, from the turbulent empire of Alexander the Great to the creation of the Roman Empire &amp; the emergence of Christianity, he serves as a witty &amp; trenchant guide. He introduces extraordinary heroes &amp; horrific villains, great thinkers &amp; bloodthirsty tyrants.",

    "description": "Geronimo Rex, Barry Hannah's brilliant first novel, which was nominated for the National Book Award, is full of the rare verve and flawless turns of phrase that have defined his status as an American master. Roiling with love and torment, lunacy and desire, hilarity and tenderness, Geronimo Rex is the bildungsroman of an unlikely hero. Reared in gloomy Dream of Pines, Louisiana, whose pines have long since yielded to paper mills, Harry Monroe is ready to take on the world. Inspired by the great Geronimo's heroic rampage through the Old West, Harry puts on knee boots and a scarf and voyages out into the swamp of adolescence in the South of the 1950s and '60s. Along the way he is attacked by an unruly peacock; discovers women, rock 'n' roll, and jazz; and stalks a pervert white supremacist who fancies himself the next Henry Miller.",

He stares at the blank pages in his typewriter, hoping for the spark that will finally ignite his ambition to write the Great Armenian Novel.<br /><br />And then he meets Clyde Potts. She is beautiful, intelligent, charming, perhaps psychic, and, for better or worse, very possibly unbalanced. With Potts\u2019s joie de vivre and her certified-insane partner in crime, Fox Harris, Snow is caught up in a series of pranks against corporate sprawl that they execute with a bit of booze and some wacky tobaccy from Australia known as Malabimbi Madness.<br /><br />Things quickly spin out of control as the trio\u2019s ultimate, diuretically inspired prank leads to an unexpected, shocking conclusion, and Walter is left to wonder if the only things you ever keep in this life are the things you let slip through your fingers.",

It gathers together sixteen original stories by some of today's finest writers of fantasy and science fiction. Together, they have won virtually every major prize -- from the National Book Award to the World Fantasy Award to the Newbery Medal -- and have made best-seller lists worldwide. These authors, including Lloyd Alexander (<i>The Chronicles of Prydain</i>), Diana Wynne Jones (<i>The Merlin Conspiracy</i>), Garth Nix (<i>The Abhorsen Trilogy</i>), Patricia A. McKillip (<i>Ombria in Shadow</i>), Meredith Ann Pierce (<i>The Darkangel Trilogy</i>), and Nancy Farmer (<i>The House of the Scorpion</i>), each with his or her own inimitable style, tell stories that will entertain, provoke, startle, amuse, and resonate long after the last page has been turned.The writers featured in Firebirds all share a connection to Firebird Books, an imprint that is dedicated to publishing the best fantasy and science fiction for teenage and adult readers.",

Hoteliers, pet-bear owners, friends of Freud (the animal trainer and vaudevillian, that is), and playthings of mad fate, they \"dream on\" in a funny, sad, outrageous, and moving novel by the remarkable author of A Son of the Circus and A Prayer for Owen Meany.<br />\"Like Garp, [THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE] is a startlingly original family saga that combines macabre humor with Dickensian sentiment and outrage at cruelty, dogmatism and injustice.\"<br />--Time<br />\"Rejoice! John Irving has written another book according to your world....You must read this book.\"<br />--Los Angeles Times<br />\"Spellbinding...Intensely human...A high-wire act of dazzling virtuosity.\"<br />--Cosmopolitan",

    "description": "During the early years of her career, while struggling to \"keep body and soul apart\" (as she ruefully put it later), Dorothy Parker wrote more than three hundred poems and verses for a variety of popular magazines and newspapers. Between 1926 and 1933 she collected most of these pieces in three volumes of poetry: <i>Enough Rope, Sunset Gun,</i> and <i>Death and Taxes.</i> The remaining poems and verses from America's most renowned cynic make up this volume. Eclectic and exuberant, these 122 once-forgotten gems display Parker's distinctive wit, irony, and precision, as she dissects early-twentieth-century American urban life and gleefully skewers a rich array of targets that range from personal foible to popular culture. With an authoritative, immensely entertaining, and critically acclaimed introduction by Stuart Y. Silverstein, <i>Not Much Fun</i> is an essential addition to the Dorothy Parker library and a welcome gift to her many admirers and devoted fans.",

    "description": "Acaso sea 'Cr\u00f3nica de una muerte anunciada' la obra m\u00e1s 'realista' de Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, pues se basa en un hecho hist\u00f3rico acontecido en la tierra natal del escritor.<br />Cuando empieza la novela, ya se sabe que los hermanos Vicario van a matar a Santiago Nasar -de hecho ya le han matado- para vengar el honor ultrajado de su hermana \u00c1ngela, pero el relato termina precisamente en el momento en que Santiago Nasar muere. El tiempo c\u00edclico, tan utilizado por Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez en sus obras, reaparece aqu\u00ed minuciosamente descompuesto en cada uno de sus momentos, reconstruido prolija y exactamente por el narrador, que va dando cuenta de lo que sucedi\u00f3 mucho tiempo atr\u00e1s, que avanza y retrocede en su relato y hasta llega mucho tiempo despu\u00e9s para contar el destino de los supervivientes. La acci\u00f3n es, a un tiempo, colectiva y personal, clara y ambigua, y atrapa al lector desde un principio, a pesar de que conoce el desenlace de la trama. La dial\u00e9ctica entre mito y realidad se ve potenciada aqu\u00ed, una vez m\u00e1s, por una prosa tan cargada de fascinaci\u00f3n que los eleva hasta las fronteras de la leyenda.",

    "description": "Que faire \u00e0 vingt ans, apr\u00e8s la mort d'une grand-m\u00e8re, quand on se retrouve sans famille et qu'on aime les cuisines plus que tout au monde? Se pelotonner contre le frigo, chercher dans son ronronnement un pr\u00e9lude au sommeil, un rem\u00e8de \u00e0 la solitude. Cette vie semi-v\u00e9g\u00e9tative de Mikage, l'h\u00e9ro\u00efne de Kitchen, est un jour troubl\u00e9e par un gar\u00e7on.<br />Y\u00fbichi Tanabe, qui l'invite \u00e0 partager l'appartement o\u00f9 il loge avec sa m\u00e8re. Mikage s'installe donc en parasite chez les Tanabe : tomb\u00e9e instantan\u00e9ment amoureuse de leur magnifique cuisine, elle est s\u00e9duite par Eriko, la \" m\u00e8re \" de Y\u00fbichi. Eriko, personnage ambigu et pur, transsexuel \u00e0 la beaut\u00e9 \u00e9blouissante, qui, traversant le r\u00e9cit comme un soleil \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re, va bient\u00f4t mourir \u00e0 son tour de mort violente... Banana Yoshimoto r\u00e9v\u00e8le dans Kitchen, \u00e0 travers une sorte de \" minimalisme fou \", une sensibilit\u00e9 nourrie de paradoxes, une sensibilit\u00e9 dans laquelle toute une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de jeunes Japonais s'est reconnue.",

    "description": "Luke is allergic to everything. He spends his days in a sterile safe-haven designed to keep out all light and dirt, while everything he knows about the world comes from books, movies, the internet and whatever his best-friend Julie tells him. He would do anything to go outside.<br /><br />Julie, brilliant and kind, could be out changing the world. Unfortunately, she\u2019s too afraid of airplane crashes, highway accidents, and potentially life-threatening bacteria to leave her hometown, her pointless waitress job, or Luke.<br /><br />Charlotte\u2019s boyfriend dropped dead from a brain hemorrhage. She disappeared for awhile, but now she\u2019s decided that she misses her friends.<br /><br />David has just been diagnosed with testicular cancer. Consequently, he\u2019s no longer wants to spend his days making pizza to pay for school. His priorities in life are changing; he just doesn\u2019t know how, yet.<br /><br />Leanne has just discovered that she may or may not have magic powers. <br /><br />When this motley bunch befriends a lottery winner with a generous heart, they all embark on a hysterical and heartwarming journey in search of the healer who just might be able to cure Luke, and perhaps give them the answers they didn\u2019t know they were looking for.",

    "description": "It all started when Douglas Adams demolished planet Earth in order to make way for an intergalactic expressway\u2013and then invited everyone to thumb a ride on a comical cosmic road trip with the likes of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, and the other daft denizens of deep space immortalized in The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. Adams made the universe a much funnier place to inhabit and forever changed the way we think about towels, extraterrestrial poetry, and especially the number 42. And then, too soon, he was gone.<br /><br />Just who was this impossibly tall Englishman who wedded science fiction and absurdist humor to create the multimillion-selling five-book \u201ctrilogy\u201d that became a cult phenomenon read round the world? Even if you\u2019ve dined in the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, you\u2019ve been exposed to only a portion of the offbeat, endearing, and irresistible Adams mystique. Have you met the only official unofficial member of Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus? The very first person to purchase a Macintosh computer? The first (and thus far only) author to play a guitar solo onstage with Pink Floyd? Adams was also the writer so notorious for missing deadlines that he had to be held captive in a hotel room under the watchful eye of his editor; the creator of the epic computer game Starship Titanic<i>;</i> and a globetrotting wildlife crusader.<br /><br />A longtime friend of the author, Nick Webb reveals many quirks and contradictions: Adams as the high-tech-gadget junkie and lavish gift giver . . .irrepressible ham and painfully timid soul . . . gregarious conversationalist and brooding depressive . . . brilliant intellect and prickly egotist. Into the brief span of forty-nine years, Douglas Adams exuberantly crammed more lives than the most resilient cat\u2013while still finding time and energy to pursue whatever side projects captivated his ever-inquisitive mind. <br /><br />By turns touching, tongue-in-cheek, and not at all timid about telling the warts-and-all truth, Wish You Were Here is summation as celebration\u2013 a look back at a life well worth the vicarious reliving, and studded with anecdote, droll comic incident, and heartfelt insight as its subject\u2019s own unforgettable tales of cosmic wanderlust. For the countless fans of Douglas Adams and his unique and winsome world, here is a wonderful postcard: to be read, reread, and treasured for the memories it bears.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

He traveled 100,000 miles back and forth, from Antarctica to the Caribbean, from the Mediterranean to the Far East, to capture a last glint of imperial glory.<br /><br />His adventures in these distant and forgotten ends of the earth make compelling, often funny reading and tell a story most of us had thought was over: a tale of the last outposts in Britain's imperial career and those who keep the flag flying.<br /><br />With a new introduction, this updated edition tells us what has happened to these extraordinary places while the author's been away.",

In graphic scenes of physical and sexual violence, Hazen tries to destroy the young girl's will. <br />It is only Gemma's childlike resilience and fertile imagination that protect her from the worst of the abuse she suffers. And in the end, the healing power of unconditional love gives Gemma the courage to speak out against her abuser at last - reclaiming her dignity as a human being.",

    "description": "Each of these delightful interconnected tales is devoted to a family living in a fertile valley on the outskirts of Monterey, California, and the effects that one particular family has on them all. Steinbeck tackles two important literary traditions here; American naturalism, with its focus on the conflict between natural instincts and the demand to conform to society's norms, and the short story cycle. Set in the heart of 'Steinbeck land', the lush Californian valleys.",

    "description": "\u201cTell anyone who asks that you\u2019re half-black and half-white, just like David Hasselhoff from Knight Rider.\u201d\u2013Angela\u2019s mother<br /><br />\u201cLove has no color,\u201d insist Angela Nissel\u2019s parents, but does it have a clue? In this candid, funny, and poignant memoir, Angela recounts growing up biracial in Philadelphia\u2013moving back and forth between black inner-city schools and white prep schools\u2013where her racial ambiguity and doomed attempts to blend in dog her teen years. Once in college, Angela experiments with black activism (hoping to find clarity in extremism), capitalizes on her \u201cexotic\u201d look at a strip club, and ends up with a major case of the blues (aka, a racial identity problem). Yet Angela is never down for the count. After moving to Los Angeles, she discovers that being multiracial is anything but simple, especially in terms of dating and romance.<br />By turns a comedy of errors and a moving coming-of-age chronicle, Mixed traces one woman\u2019s unforgettable journey to self-acceptance and belonging.<br /><br />Praise for <i>Mixed<br /></i><br />\u201cI love Angela Nissel's writing. Reading <i>Mixed</i> was like getting a letter from a best friend I forgot I had. How ironic that a book written by someone who felt like no one \"got\" her will surely be one of those rare books everyone gets- black, white, both, neither. Hilarious, sweet, and honest, <i>Mixed</i> is the perfect read if you've ever felt like the one standing on the outside-- and let's face it, who hasn't? - -Jill Soloway, author of <i>Tiny Ladies in Shiny Pants</i><br /><br />\u201cNissel is humorous, poignant, and proud yet also empathetic and generous as she recounts her constant struggle to answer the perennial question persons of mixed race seem required to ask of themselves in our society\u2013where do I fit in?.... All readers stand to learn from her account.\u201d \u2014 <i>Booklist</i><br /><br />\u201cColorful anecdotes, marvelous dialogue and a thoughtful narrative make this memoir a delight.\u201d<i>\u2013Kirkus Reviews </i>(starred review)<br /><br />\"If David Sedaris was a straight biracial female, this is the book he'd write. This book is so funny I've already started telling people I helped Angela write it.\" -- Bill Lawrence, creator of <i>Scrubs</i><br /><br />\"Growing up black and white, I always felt I had the best of both worlds. I feel the same way about <i>Mixed</i>. It's the perfect blend of hilarious comedy and sometimes tragic reality.\" -- Yvette Lee Bowser, creator of <i>Living Single </i>and executive producer of <i>Half and Half</i><br />\"Mixed is a hilarious must-read for anyone searching for the enchanting path to self-discovery. Angela Nissel's precise account of living the mixed race experience not only hit home with me, but the journey is deliciously enlightening and heart-rending at the same time. It's a journey well worth taking.\" --Halle Berry",

    "description": "In this brilliant, luminous novel, one of our finest realist writers gives us a story of surpassing depth and emotional power. Acclaimed for her lucid and compassionate exploration of the American family, Roxana Robinson sets her new work on familiar terrain\u2014New York City and the Adirondacks\u2014but with <i>Sweetwater</i> she transcends the particulars of the domestic sphere with a broader, more encompassing vision. In this poignant account of a young widow and her second marriage, Robinson expands her scope to include the larger natural world as well as the smaller, more intimate one of the home.<br /><br />Isabel Green\u2019s marriage to Paul Simmons, after the death of her first husband, marks her reconnection to life\u2014a venture she\u2019s determined will succeed. But this proves to be harder than she\u2019d anticipated, and the challenges of starting afresh seem more complicated in adulthood. Staying at the Simmons lodge for their annual summer visit, Isabel finds herself entering into a set of familial complexities. She struggles to understand her new husband, his elderly, difficult parents and his brother, whose relationship with Paul seems oddly fraught. Furthermore, her second marriage begins to cast into sharp relief the troubling echoes of her first. Isabel\u2019s professional life plays a part as well: a passionate environmental advocate, she is aware of the tensions within the mountain landscape itself during a summer of spectacular beauty and ominous drought.<br /><br />In her cool, elegant prose, Robinson gracefully delivers a plot that is complex, surprising and ultimately wrenching in its impact. As the strands of family are woven tightly and inevitably together, and as the past painfully informs the present, the vivid backdrop of the physical world provides its own eloquent dynamic. <i>Sweetwater</i> is a stunning achievement by a writer at the peak of her craft.",

    "description": "When Souad was seventeen she fell in love. In her West Bank village, as in so many others, sex before marriage is considered a grave dishonor to one's family and is punishable by death. This was her crime. Her brother-in-law was given the task of meting out her punishment. One morning while Souad was washing the family's clothes, he poured gasoline over her and set her on fire. Miraculously, she survived, rescued by women of her village, who put out the flames and took her to a local hospital. Horribly burned over seventy percent of her body and still denounced by her family, Souad was able to receive the care she needed only after the intervention of a European aid worker. Now in permanent exile from her homeland, she has decided to tell her story and reveal the barbarity of a practice that continues to this day. Burned Alive ...is the first true account ever published by a victim of an \"honor crime.\" Souad's inspiring testimony is a shocking, moving, and harrowing story of cruelty and incomparable courage...and an inspiring call to action to end a heinous tradition.",

But for all their devotion, mathematics is indifferent, unaltered by any of their dramas . . . Against indifference, I want to tell their stories.\u201d Which she does in a haunting, incantatory voice, the two lives unfolding in parallel narratives that overlap in the magnitude of each man\u2019s achievement and demise: G\u00f6del, delusional and paranoid, would starve himself to death; Turing, arrested for homosexual activities, would be driven to suicide. And they meet as well in the narrator\u2019s mind, where facts are interwoven with her desire and determination to find meaning in the maze of their stories: two men devoted to truth of the highest abstract nature, yet unable to grasp the mundane truths of their own lives.<br /><br />A unique amalgam of luminous imagination and richly evoked historic character and event\u2014A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines\u00a0is a story about the pursuit of truth and its effect on the lives of two men. A story of genius and madness, incredible yet true.",

What if she then tells you that her body is actually in a coma on the other side of town? Should you have her see a psychiatrist or should you consult one yourself? Or do you take a chance and believe in her, and allow yourself to be swept up in an extraordinary adventure?<br /><br />This is the beginning of the dilemma that Arthur, a young San Francisco architect, is faced with when he discovers Lauren in his apartment.<br /><br />Arthur is the only man who can share Lauren's secret, the only one who can see her, hear her, and talk to her when no one else so much as senses her presence. So when doctors prepare to end Lauren's physical care -- which would destroy the magical bond she and Arthur cherish -- he must find a way to save her. For, after all, it is only her love that can save him.<br /><br />\"If Only It Were True\" is a heartwarming love story impossible to forget, an adventure that is by turns breathtaking and hilarious -- a captivating tale that evokes the essence of romance and our boundless capacity to believe.",

    "description": "Against the monumental canvas of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe and Russia, unfolds the magnificent story of Peter the Great, crowned at the age of 10. A barbarous, volatile feudal tsar with a taste for torture; a progressive and enlightened reformer of government and science; a statesman of vision and colossal significance: Peter the Great embodied the greatest strengths and weaknesses of Russia while being at the very forefront of her development.<br /><br />Robert K. Massie delves deep into the life of this captivating historical figure, chronicling the pivotal events that shaped a boy into a legend - including his 'incognito' travels in Europe, his unquenchable curiosity about Western ways, his obsession with the sea and establishment of the stupendous Russian navy, his creation of an unbeatable army, and his relationships with those he loved most: Catherine, his loving mistress, wife, and successor; and Menshikov, the charming, unscrupulous prince who rose to power through Peter's friendship. Impetuous and stubborn, generous and cruel, a man of enormous energy and complexity, Peter the Great is brought fully to life.",

    "description": "As the American century draws to an uneasy close, Philip Roth gives us a novel of unqualified greatness that is an elegy for all our century's promises of prosperity, civic order, and domestic bliss. Roth's protagonist is Swede Levov, a legendary athlete at his Newark high school, who grows up in the booming postwar years to marry a former Miss New Jersey, inherit his father's glove factory, and move into a stone house in the idyllic hamlet of Old Rimrock. And then one day in 1968, Swede's beautiful American luck deserts him.<br /><br />For Swede's adored daughter, Merry, has grown from a loving, quick-witted girl into a sullen, fanatical teenager\u2014a teenager capable of an outlandishly savage act of political terrorism. And overnight Swede is wrenched out of the longer-for American pastoral and into the indigenous American berserk. Compulsively readable, propelled by sorrow, rage, and a deep compassion for its characters, this is Roth's masterpiece.",

    "description": "Marking the debut of a stunning new literary talent, Lisa Huang Fleischman's extraordinary saga -- inspired by her grandmother's life as an early feminist, political activist, and friend of Mao Zedong -- is a masterpiece about one clever and resourceful woman, growing up amidst the turmoil of twentieth-century China. <i>Dream of the Walled City</i> <br /><br />Born in 1890, the privileged and sheltered daughter of a high-ranking imperial official, Jade Virtue spends her childhood enclosed by the towering walls of her family's sprawling mansion, never glimpsing the desperate struggle of China's ancient society, as the old ways are challenged and the twentieth century - fast, fearsome, and tumultuous - rushes in. But when her father mysteriously dies, young Jade Virtue is suddenly thrust into poverty, and experiences firsthand a traditional culture falling apart under the onslaught of growing rebellion against the Emperor, rapid social changes, and the mounting aggression of Japan and the West. <br /><br />Fleischman has rendered a richly textured, panoramic vision of Chinese life in the perilous years between the end of the empire and the Communist triumph of 1949, charting Jade Virtue's arranged first marriage to the corrupt opium addict Wang Mang, who harbors a terrible secret in his family's past; her awakening independence and ambivalent politics; her struggles with motherhood; and her fascinating acquaintance with a gifted, idealistic, fiercely ambitious young man named Mao Zedong. But the most important choices of her life are shaped by her conflicting loyalties to her intense lifelong friendship with Jinyu, a fiery woman revolutionary, and to Guai, a government official and sworn enemy of the Communists, with whom she finally discovers true and redemptive love. <br /><br />Exquisitely nuanced and lyrical yet marked with a driving power, <i>Dream Of The Walled City</i> is an enthralling novel of hard-won personal independence set against the vivid backdrop of a rapidly changing world. From the final days of the last dynasty through the savage Japanese invasion during World War II to the formidable red dawn of the Communist triumph; from the backward rural province of Hunan to exile on the tropical shores of Taiwan; and from the binding chains of predetermined fate to the exhilarating liberation of a human spirit, this is a remarkable odyssey you will never forget.",

    "description": "A sweeping chronicle of women's battles for reproductive freedom throughout American history, <em>Pregnancy and Power</em> explores the many forces--social, racial, economic, and political--that have shaped women's reproductive lives in the United States.<br /><br />Leading historian Rickie Solinger argues that a woman's control over her body involves much more than the right to choose an abortion. Reproductive politics were at play when slaveholders devised breeding schemes, when the U.S. government took Indian children from their families in the nineteenth century, and when doctors pressed Latina women to be sterilized in the 1970s. Tracing the diverse plot lines of women's reproductive lives throughout American history, Solinger redefines the idea of reproductive freedom, putting race and class at the center of the effort to control sex and pregnancy in America over time.<br /><br />Solinger asks which women have how many children under what circumstances, and shows how reproductive experiences have been encouraged or coerced, rewarded or punished, honored or exploited over the last 250 years. Viewed in this way, the debate over reproductive rights raises questions about access to sex education and prenatal care, about housing laws, about access to citizenship, and about which women lose children to adoption and foster care.<br /><br /><em>Pregnancy and Power</em> shows that a complete understanding of reproductive politics must take into account the many players shaping public policy--lawmakers, educators, employers, clergy, physicians--as well as the consequences for women who obey and resist these policies. Tracing the diverse plotlines of women's reproductive lives throughout American history, Solinger redefines the idea of reproductive freedom, putting race and class at the center of the struggle to control sex and pregnancy in America.",

    "description": "In <i>Sula</i>, Toni Morrison, winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize for literature, tells the story of two women--friends since childhood, separated in young adulthood, and reunited as grown women. Nel Wright grows up to become a wife and mother, happy to remain in her hometown of Medallion, Ohio. Sula Peace leaves Medallion to experience college, men, and life in the big city, an exceptional choice for a black woman to make in the late 1920s. <p> As girls, Nel and Sula are the best of friends, only children who find in each other a kindred spirit to share in each girl's loneliness and imagination. When they meet again as adults, it's clear that Nel has chosen a life of acceptance and accommodation, while Sula must fight to defend her seemingly unconventional choices and beliefs. But regardless of the physical and emotional distance that threatens this extraordinary friendship, the bond between the women remains unbreakable: \"Her old friend had come home.... Sula, whose past she had lived through and with whom the present was a constant sharing of perceptions. Talking to Sula had always been a conversation with herself.\"</p><p> Lyrical and gripping, <i>Sula</i> is an honest look at the power of friendship amid a backdrop of family, love, race, and the human condition. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p>",

Levi, ne \"La tregua\", ha voluto raccontare anche il lungo viaggio di ritorno attraverso l'Europa dai campi di sterminio: una narrazione che contempera il senso di una libert\u00e0 ritrovata con i segni lasciati dagli orrori sofferti.<br /><br />'With the moral stamina and intellectual poise of a twentieth-century Titan, this slightly built, dutiful, unassuming chemist set out systematically to remember the German hell on earth, steadfastly to think it through, and then to render it comprehensible in lucid, unpretentious prose. He was profoundly in touch with the minutest workings of the most endearing human events and with the most contemptible. What has survived in Levi's writing isn't just his memory of the unbearable, but also, in <i>The Periodic Table</i> and <i>The Wrench</i>, his delight in what made the world exquisite to him. He was himself a magically endearing man, the most delicately forceful enchanter I've ever known' - Philip Roth.",

    "description": "Oh, the joys of pregnancy! There's the gassiness, constipation, queasiness, and exhaustion, the forgetfulness, crankiness, and the constant worry. Of course, no woman is spared the discomforts and humiliations of pregnancy, but most are too polite to complain or too embarrassed to talk about them. Not Jenny McCarthy! In the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling <i>Belly Laughs</i>, actress and new mother Jenny McCarthy reveals the naked truth about the tremendous joys, the excruciating pains, and the unseemly disfigurement that go along with pregnancy. Never shy, frequently crude, and always laugh-out-loud funny, McCarthy covers it all in the grittiest of girlfriend detail. From morning sickness and hormonal rage, to hemorrhoids, pregnant sex, and the torture and sweet relief that is delivery, <i>Belly Laughs</i> is must-read comic relief for anyone who is pregnant, who has ever been pregnant, is trying to get pregnant, or, indeed, has ever been born!",

An exuberant edition of the Lewis Carroll masterpiece, lavishly illustrated by one of the most beloved children's book artists of our time. <br />Helen Oxenbury's ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND set a new standard for contemporary editions of Lewis Carroll's beloved classic. And now she has illustrated its companion, ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING- GLASS, with equal intimacy, warmth, and charm. Here again is Alice, dressed in her bright blue jumper and ready for adventure like any modern child. All it takes is a bit of curiosity about the room reversed in the mirror and suddenly Alice is in the Looking-Glass world with all manner of comical and magical characters -- Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the lion and the unicorn, and a whole game board of chess pieces come to life. <br />On page after page, Helen Oxenbury's incomparable line drawings, sepia illustrations, and full-color paintings give today's children their own utterly accessible view into Lewis Carroll's timeless nonsense.",

    "description": "It\u2019s as old as time: the breakup letter. The kiss-off. The Dear John. The big adios. Simple in its premise, stunningly perfect in its effect. From Anne Boleyn to <i>Sex and the City</i> writer/producer Cindy Chupack, from women both well-known and unknown, imaginary and real, the letters here span the centuries and the emotions\u2014providing a stirring, utterly gratifying glimpse at the power, wit, and fury of a woman\u2019s voice. In a never-before-published letter, Ana\u00efs Nin gives her lover, C. L. Baldwin, a piece of her mind. Charlotte Bront\u00eb, in formal fashion, refuses the marriage proposal of Henry Nussey. In a previously unpublished letter, Sylvia Plath writes to her childhood friend and brief lover, Phillip McCurdy, expressing her wish to maintain a platonic relationship. And \u201cSusie Q.\u201d lets \u201cJohnny Smack-O\u201d know that she\u2019s onto his philandering.<br /><br />The brilliance of the mad missives, caustic communiqu\u00e9s, downhearted dispatches, sweet send-offs, and every other sort of good-bye that fills these pages will surely resonate with anyone who has ever loved, lost, left, languished, or laughed a hearty last laugh. <br /><b>\n  <br /></b>",

    "description": "Louisa May Alcott once wrote that she had taken her pen for a bridegroom. Leona Rostenberg and Madeleine Stern, friends and business partners for fifty years, have in many ways taken up their pens and passion for literature much in the same way. The \"Holmes &amp; Watson\" of the rare book business, Rostenberg and Stern are renowned for unlocking the hidden secret of Louisa May Alcott's life when they discovered her pseudonym, A.M. Barnard, along with her anonymously published \"blood and thunder\" stories on subjects like transvestitism, hashish smoking, and feminism.<br /><br /><i>Old Books, Rare Friends</i> describes their mutual passion for books and literary sleuthing as they take us on their earliest European book buying jaunts. Using what they call Finger-spitzengef\u00fchl, the art of evaluating antiquarian books by handling, experience, and instinct, we are treated to some of their greatest discoveries amid the mildewed basements of London's booksellers after the Blitz. We experience the thrill of finding one of the earliest known books printed in America between 1617-1619 by the Pilgrim Press and learn about the influential role of publisher-printers from the fifteenth century.<br /><br />Like a precious gem, <i>Old Books, Rare Friends</i> is a book to treasure about the companionship of two rare friends and their shared passion for old books.",

    "description": "In this uproarious new novel, Richard Russo performs his characteristic high-wire walk between hilarity and heartbreak. Russo's protagonist is William Henry Devereaux, Jr., the reluctant chairman of the English department of a badly underfunded college in the Pennsylvania rust belt.\u00a0Devereaux's reluctance is partly rooted in his character--he is a born anarchist-- and partly in the fact that his department is more savagely divided than the Balkans.<br /><br />In the course of a single week, Devereaux will have his nose mangled by an angry colleague, imagine his wife is having an affair with his dean, wonder if a curvaceous adjunct is trying to seduce him with peach pits, and threaten to execute a goose on local television.\u00a0\u00a0All this while coming to terms with his philandering father, the dereliction of his youthful promise, and the ominous failure of certain vital body functions.\u00a0In short, <i>Straight Man</i> is classic Russo--side-splitting and true-to-life, witty, compassionate, and impossible to put down.",
