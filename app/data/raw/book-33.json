    "description": "In Russia's struggle with Napoleon, Tolstoy saw a tragedy that involved all mankind. Yet while his historical vision ranged beyond national frontiers, his imaginative vision focused, with extraordinary intensity, on the lives of individuals, on the physical reality of human experience and its bewildering complexity. Greater than a historical chronicle, War and Peace is an affirmation of life itself, 'a complete picture', as a contemporary reviewer put it, 'of everything in which people find their happiness and greatness, their grief and humiliation'.",

Reviewing the work in <em>The New Republic</em>, James Woods wrote that this groundbreaking volume \"represents a triumph of translating, editing, and publishing. Beautiful to hold, scholarly and also popularly accessible, it is an enactment of love.\" Considered one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century, Isaac Babel has left his mark on a generation of readers and writers. This book will stand as Babel's final, most enduring legacy. Winner of the Koret Jewish Book Award; A <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book, a and <em>Library Journal</em> Best Book, a <em>Washington Post</em> Book World Rave, a <em>Village Voice</em> Favorite Book of the Year.",

    "description": "Whether it's sleek leather pants, a shiny new Apple computer, or a designer toaster, we make important decisions as consumers every day based on our sensory experience. Sensory appeals are everywhere, and they are intensifying, radically changing how Americans live and work. The twenty-first century has become the age of aesthetics, and whether we realize it or not, this influence has taken over the marketplace, and much more.<br /><br />In this penetrating, keenly observed book, Virginia Postrel makes the argument that appearance counts, that aesthetic value is real. Drawing from fields as diverse as fashion, real estate, politics, design, and economics, Postrel deftly chronicles our culture's aesthetic imperative and argues persuasively that it is a vital component of a healthy, forward-looking society.<br /><br />Intelligent, incisive, and thought-provoking, <em>The Substance of Style</em> is a groundbreaking portrait of the democratization of taste and a brilliant examination of the way we live now.",

    "description": "Realising that his New Year is probably going to be a disaster, as usual, our narrator, on impulse, walks into a travel agency to book a week in the sun. Sensitive to his limited means and dislike of Muslim countries, the travel agent suggests an island full of 21st century hedonism, set in a bizarre lunar landscape - Lanzarote.<br /><br />On Lanzarote, one can meet some fascinating human specimens, notably Pam and Barbara - 'non-exclusive' German lesbians - who can give rise to some interesting combinations. Will they succeed in seducing Rudi, the police inspector from Luxembourg, currently living in exile in Brussels? Or will he join the 'Azraelian' sect, as they prepare for humanity to be regenerated by extra-terrestrials? As for our narrator, will he consider his week's holiday on the island a success?",

And when an elite SS extermination squad is dispatched to solve the problem, the men find a something that's both powerful and terrifying. Invisible and silent, the enemy selects one victim per night, leaving the bloodless and mutilated corpses behind to terrify its future victims.<br /><br />Panicked, the Nazis bring in a local expert on folklore\u2015who just happens to be Jewish\u2015to shed some light on the mysterious happenings. And unbeknownst to anyone, there is another visitor on his way\u2015a man who awoke from a nightmare and immediately set out to meet his destiny.<br /><br />The battle has begun: On one side, the ultimate evil created by man, and on the other...the unthinkable, unstoppable, unknowing terror that man has inevitably awakened.",

    "description": "In Coney Island, Brooklyn, Sarah Goldfarb, a lonely widow, wants nothing more than to lose weight and appear on a television game show. She becomes addicted to diet pills in her obsessive quest, while her junkie son, Harry, along with his girlfriend, Marion, and his best friend, Tyrone, have devised an illicit shortcut to wealth and leisure by scoring a pound of uncut heroin. Entranced by the gleaming visions of their futures, these four convince themselves that unexpected setbacks are only temporary. Even as their lives slowly deteriorate around them, they cling to their delusions and become utterly consumed in the spiral of drugs and addiction, refusing to see that they have instead created their own worst nightmares.<br /><br />\"Selby's place is in the front rank of American novelists. HIs work has the power, the intimacy with suffering and morality, the honesty and moral urgency of Doestoevsky's. To understand Selby's work is to understand the anguish of America.\" - The New York Times Book Review",

Rebel Kitty 18 hides, stealthily finishing her research on magic, demons, and Bartimaeus. She has a daring plan that she hopes will break the endless cycle of conflict between djinn and humans. But will anyone listen to what she has to say? Together the trio face treacherous magicians, a complex conspiracy, and a rebellious faction of demons. To survive, they must test the limits of this world and question the deepest parts of themselves.",

    "description": "<b>\"So charged with pain and wonder that the novel becomes poetry.\" -<i>New York Times</i></b> <p><i>The Bluest Eye</i> is Toni Morrison's first novel, a book heralded for its richness of language and boldness of vision. Set in the author's girlhood hometown of Lorain, Ohio, it tells the story of black, eleven-year-old Pecola Breedlove. Pecola prays for her eyes to turn blue so that she will be as beautiful and beloved as all the blond, blue-eyed children in America. In the autumn of 1941, the year the marigolds in the Breedlove's garden do not blom, Pecola's life does change--in painful, devastating ways.</p> <p>With it's vivid evocation of the fear and loneliness at the heart of a child's yearning, and the tragedy of its fulfillment, <i>The Bluest Eye</i> remains one of Toni Morrison's most powerful, unforgettable novels--and a significant work of American fiction.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Three Complete Novels, <br /><i>The Quilter's Apprentice, Round Robin,</i> and <i>The Cross-Country Quilters,</i> from <i>The New York Times</i> Bestselling Author, Jennifer Chiaverini </p><p><br /> Here's where it all began -- the three novels that first made beloved friends of the Elm Creek Quilters, who stepped out of Pennsylvania's idyllic Elm Creek Manor and into the heart of America. </p><p> <br /><i>The Quilter's Apprentice:</i> Master quilter Sylvia Compson shares the secrets of her creative gifts with her young assistant, Sarah McClure. During their lessons, the intricate, varied threads of Sylvia's life begin to emerge. It is the story of a young wife living through the hardships and agonies of the World War II home front; of a family torn apart by jealously and betrayal; of misunderstanding, loss, and a tragedy that can never be undone. As the bond between them deepens, Sarah resolves to help Sylvia free herself from remembered sorrows and restore her life -- and her home, Elm Creek Manor -- to its former glory. In turn, Sylvia helps Sarah confront her own troubled past. Out of their shared triumph is born a lifelong friendship and a fledgling business called Elm Creek Quilts. </p><p> <br /><i>Round Robin:</i> To celebrate the beginning of Elm Creek Quilts, Sarah, Sylvia, and their circle of friends name themselves the Elm Creek Quilters. As a gift to Sylvia, the others have begun a round robin -- a quilt created by sewing concentric patchwork to a central block as it is passed around a sewing circle. As each woman makes her creative contribution, she adds her story to the history of Elm Creek Manor. Resplendent in green, blue, and gold, the quilt serves as a symbol of the complex, lasting ties that unify mothers and daughters, sisters and friends. As they stitch together the sometimes harmonious -- often discordant -- scraps of their crazy-quilt lives, the Elm Creek Quilters learn that friendship is a most precious gift and that even in the darkest of times, love illuminates the way home. </p><p> <br /><i>The Cross-Country Quilters:</i> Five women arrive at Elm Creek Manor, hoping to find in their quilting lessons an escape from the problems they have left at home. This far-flung group becomes fast friends who pledge to complete a \"challenge quilt\" -- symbolic of each woman's personal goals -- in one year's time. Although the Cross-Country Quilters share a common creative goal, as the year goes by, their bonds are tested by the demands of daily life. But despite differences in age, race, and background, the friends' love for quilting and affection for one another unite them in a patchwork of caring and acceptance. The quilt they make reminds them of an everlasting truth -- friends may be separated by great distance, yet the strength of their bond can transcend any obstacle. </p><p> <br />\"Endearing characters and pleasant vignettes render this series as charming and cozy as a favorite blanket,\" said <i>Publishers Weekly</i> of the Elm Creek Quilts books. Jennifer Chiaverini is at her heartwarming best in these three novels that launched a bestselling phenomenon.</p>",

Between study, bartending, and an internship with a sex therapist whose techniques would make a Playboy bunny blush, there's zero time for romance. Still, Amanda is flattered to receive an anonymous Valentine\u2026until the messages take a sinister turn.<br /><br />Stockbroker William Sloan swears he's not the one sending Amanda cards, but he suspects the culprit's intentions are more dubious than sharing a box of Godiva. Something about gorgeous, determined Amanda brings out the usually reserved William's inner he-man, and he insists on acting as a decoy boyfriend.<br /><br />With a fake relationship masking some very real lust, it's only a matter of time before William and Amanda give in to the sweetest of temptation\u00ads. And once he's dealt with her secret stalker, William's next mission is to strike Amanda with Cupid's arrow\u2026.",

    "description": "<i>A fascinating and harrowing account of the men and women who struggle to improve the lives of people in desperate need.</i><br /><br />Doctors Without Borders (also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) is arguably the best known humanitarian organization in the world. These professional men and women deliver emergency aid to victims of armed conflict, epidemics and natural disasters as well as to many others who lack reliable health care. Each year, more than 2,500 volunteer doctors, nurses and other professionals join locally hired staff to provide medical aid and health care in more than 80 countries.<br /><br />At the forefront of this organization and its work are the volunteer doctors and other health professionals who risk their lives to perform surgery, establish or rehabilitate hospitals and clinics, run nutrition and sanitation programs, and train local medical personnel. This book follows these men and women on location as they risk their own health, well-being and lives to treat patients in desperate need.<br /><br />These engaging true stories with dramatic color photographs examine the lives of individual volunteer medical professionals from around the world who:<br /><br /><br />Perform emergency surgery in the war-torn regions of Africa and Asia Treat the homeless in the streets of Europe Understand cultural customs and societal differences that affect health care Witness and report genocidal atrocities. This new paperback edition is updated to include events that occurred following publication of the hardcover.<br /><br /><b>Hope in Hell</b> chronicles the raucous founding of Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the organization. If there is a horrific event, MSF will be there. This book tells why and how.",

    "description": "<b>Reminiscent of Orwell and Huxley's dystopian novels, this classic of women's literature is an intelligent and well-written contribution to the sex-role debate.</b><br /><br />Welcome to the land of Egalia, where gender roles are topsy-turvy as \"wim\" wield the power and \"menwim\" light the home fires. This re-telling of the prototypical coming-of-age novel will have readers laughing out loud and wondering who should prevail: poor Petronius, who wants more than anything to cruise the oceans as a seawom; or his powerful and protective mother Director Bram, who rules her family with an authoritarian righteousness. But for better or for worse, as the masculist party begins to organize and protest, the landscape of Egalia threatens to change forever. More than just a humorous romp, <i>Egalia's Daughters</i> poses the provocative question of whether the culprit in gender subjugation is gender itself or power-no matter who wields it.",

    "description": "Lilly, the main character of Camilla Gibb\u2019s stunning new novel, has anything but a stable childhood. The daughter of English/Irish hippies, she was \u201cborn in Yugoslavia, breast-fed in the Ukraine, weaned in Corsica, freed from nappies in Sicily and walking by the time [they] got to the Algarve\u2026\u201d The family\u2019s nomadic adventure ends in Tangier when Lilly\u2019s parents are killed in a drug deal gone awry. Orphaned at eight, Lilly is left in the care of a Sufi sheikh, who shows her the way of Islam through the Qur\u2019an. When political turmoil erupts, Lilly, now sixteen, is sent to the ancient walled city of Harar, Ethiopia, where she stays in a dirt-floored compound with an impoverished widow named Nouria and her four children. <br /><br />In Harar, Lilly earns her keep by helping with the household chores and teaching local children the Qur\u2019an. Ignoring the cries of \u201cfarenji\u201d (foreigner), she slowly begins to put down roots, learning the language and immersing herself in a culture rich in customs and rituals and lush with glittering bright headscarves, the chorus of muezzins and the scent of incense and coffee. She is drawn to an idealistic half-Sudanese doctor named Aziz, and the two begin to meet every Saturday at a social gathering. As they stay behind to talk, Lilly finds her faith tested for the first time in her life: \u201cThe desire to remain in his company overwhelmed common sense; I would pick up my good Muslim self on the way home.\u201d Just as their love begins to blossom, they are wrenched apart when the aging emperor Haile Selassie is deposed by the brutal Dergue regime. Lilly seeks exile in London, while Aziz stays to pursue his revolutionary passions.<br /><br />In London, Lilly\u2019s life as a white Muslim is no less complicated. A hospital staff nurse, she befriends a refugee from Ethiopia named Amina, whose daughter she helped to deliver in a back alley. The two women set up a community association to re-unite refugees with lost family members. Their work, however, isn\u2019t entirely altruistic. Both women are looking for someone: Amina, her husband, Yusuf, and Lilly, Aziz, who remains firmly, painfully, implanted in her heart. <br /><br />The first-person narrative alternates seamlessly between England (1981-91) and Ethiopia (1970-74), weaving a rich tapestry of one woman\u2019s quest to maintain faith and love through revolution, upheaval and the alienation of life in exile.<br /><br /><b>Sweetness in the Belly</b><i> </i>was universally praised for the tremendous empathy that Gibb brings to an ambitious story. <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> writes that the novel \"reflect(s) the pain, cultural relocation and uncertainty of tribal, political and religious refugees the world over. Gibb's territory is urgently modern and controversial but she enters it softly, with grace, integrity and a lovely compassionate story. [It is a] poem to belief and to the displaced\u2013humane, resonant, original, impressive.\" According to the <i>Literary Review of Canada, </i><b>Sweetness in the Belly </b>is \u201c\u2026a novel that is culturally sensitive, consummately researched and deeply compassionate\u2026richly imagined, full of sensuous detail and arresting imagery\u2026Gibb has smuggled Western readers into the centre of lives they might never otherwise come into contact with, let alone understand.\u201d",

    "description": "Sorayya Khan's debut novel is a powerful and poignant story of memory, family, tragedy, and forgiveness. Set in modern-day Islambad, Pakistan, the book depicts an extraordinary child who enables her mother, Sajida, and her grandfather, Ali, to confront the pasts they have chosen to suppress. Through Noor's artwork, her family members are transported through their haunted memories of the 1970 cyclone that claimed the lives of a million people and the violent atrocities of the 1971 conflict between East and West Pakistan that eventually created the independent country of Bangladesh. As Noor's drawings bring to life sights, sounds, smells, and sensations from the past, her family is forced to admit of the betrayals and disillusionments that they thought had been buried with time. Moving, heartbreaking, and unsettling by turns, Noor is a novel about the horrors of war, the power of forgiveness, and, most important, the strength of the human spirit.",

From drunken golf-cart races across the Paramount lot to make-out sessions in Tiger's doghouse and Cindy's near-drowning in Hawaii, Barry WiIliams tells the real Brady story, previously hidden behind the carefully groomed facade of TV's favorite family.This collector's edition of Growing Up Brady is packed with first-hand memories, newly published photos, and updated information on the cast, crew and creators of \"The Brady Bunch\". Its the most detailed documentation or one of television's most popular shows, as told from the inside. Forget about the rumors and find out the real stories of inter-Brady dating, behind-the scenes battles, and the real people behind the Bunch.",

    "description": "I choose to fight my battles through my music . . . I was born a feminist. And then at age five, when my strict Christian grandmother punished me, I realized, I\u2019m not penetrating here. I\u2019m just pissing people off. So I had to find another way to penetrate. I had to redefine what that word means. That word now is really about an opening, an entering into a separate space. And after the first phase of my life, I realized that it was okay to enter that space without having to be invaded . . . I like the idea of just being able to be inside. Not using <i>penetration</i> as a violent word. The idea of being able to find keys . . . music, using keys to get into a space that we couldn\u2019t before . . . <br />Now, backstage at an undisclosed arena where the sweat of athletes is still perfuming my makeshift dressing room, my many conversations with Ann Powers have begun . . . <br /><br />\u201cYou come from the journalist side. I come from the artist side. It can become offensive. I\u2019m sure from your side as well as from mine.\u201d <br /><br />\u201cWell, it\u2019s true everyone expects us to be enemies. And in some ways we are. My job is interpretation. Yours is art, which often benefits from mystery . . .\u201d<br />Ann and I decided to strip our roles back to basics. We are both women born feminists in the 1960s. We are both married. We are both mothers. We are both in the music industry. Traditionally we are enemies. But for this project to be effective, I had to allow Ann to expose Tori Amos. And Tori Amos\u2019s inner circle. And me.\u201d\u2013 <i>from the Introduction</i><br /><br />BUY TORI AMOS\u2019S LATEST RECORDING, <i>THE BEEKEEPER</i>, ON EPIC RECORDS<br /><br /><b>An intimate, eye-opening look inside the life of one of the most unique and adored performers of contemporary rock music</b>From her critically acclaimed 1992 debut, <i>Little </i>Earthquakes, to the recent hit, <i>Scarlet\u2019s Walk</i>, Tori Amos has been a formidable force in contemporary music, with one of the most dedicated fan bases in the industry. In <i>Tori Amos: Piece by Piece</i>, the singer herself takes readers beyond the mere facts, explaining the specifics of her creative process\u2014how her songs go from ideas and melodies to recordings and passionately performed concert pieces. <br />Written with acclaimed music journalist Ann Powers, <i>Tori Amos: Piece by Piece</i> is a firsthand account of the most intricate and intimate details of Amos\u2019s life as both a private individual and a very public performing musician. In passionate and informative prose, Amos explains how her songs come to her and how she records and then performs them for audiences everywhere, all the while connecting with listeners across the world and maintaining her own family life (which includes raising a young daughter). But it is also much more, a verbal collage made by two strong female voices \u2013 and the voices of those closest to Amos\u2014that calls upon genealogy, myth, and folklore to express Amos\u2019s unique and fascinating personal history. In short, we see the pieces that make up \u2013 as Amos herself puts it\u2014\u201cthe woman we call Tori.\u201d<br />With photos taken especially for this book by the photographer Loren Haynes, <i>Tori Amos: Piece by Piece</i> is a rare treat for both Tori listeners and newcomers alike, a look into the heart and mind of an extraordinary musician.",

    "description": "Dodging minefields in Cambodia, diving into the icy waters outside a Russian bath, Chef Bourdain travels the world over in search of the ultimate meal.<br /><br />The only thing Anthony Bourdain loves as much as cooking is traveling, and <i>A Cook's Tour</i> is the shotgun marriage of his two greatest passions. Inspired by the question, 'What would be the perfect meal?', Anthony sets out on a quest for his culinary holy grail.<br /><br />Our adventurous chef starts out in Japan, where he eats traditional Fugu, a poisonous blowfish which can be prepared only by specially licensed chefs. He then travels to Cambodia, up the mine-studded road to Pailin into autonomous Khmer Rouge territory and to Phnom Penh's Gun Club, where local fare is served up alongside a menu of available firearms. In Saigon, he's treated to a sustaining meal of live Cobra heart before moving on to savor a snack with the Viet Cong in the Mecong Delta. Further west, <i>Kitchen Confidential</i> fans will recognize the Gironde of Tony's youth, the first stop on his European itinerary.

    "description": "\"Castle Richmond\" is a drama of blackmail, disinheritance and romance set in Ireland. As the Fitzgerald family struggle to keep possession of their home, the castle of the book's title, Herbert Fitzgerald and his handsome cousin Owen pursue and fall in love with the same woman, Lady Clara Desmond, whose widowed mother herself has secret designs on Owen. Beyond these intrigues up at the great houses of the Anglo-Irish aristocracy lies an Ireland devastated by the 1845-9 famine, scandal which Trollope does not confront but which none less haunts his novel.",

In a seamless meshing of exhaustive research and narrative, Simon Sebag Montefiore gives us the everyday details of a monstrous life. We see Stalin playing his deadly game of power and paranoia at debauched dinners at Black Sea villas and in the apartments of the Kremlin. We witness first-hand how the dictator and his magnates carried out the Great Terror and the war against the Nazis, and how their families lived in this secret world of fear, betrayal, murder, and sexual degeneracy. Montefiore gives an unprecedented understanding of Stalin\u2019s dictatorship, and a Stalin as human and complicated as he is brutal.",

    "description": "The sheriff's deputy at the front door brings hard news to Ree Dolly. Her father has skipped bail on charges that he ran a crystal meth lab, and the Dollys will lose their house if he doesn't show up for his next court date.<br /><br />Ree's father has disappeared before. The Dolly clan has worked the shadowy side of the law for generations, and arrests (and attempts to avoid them) are part of life in Rathlin Valley. But the house is all they have, and Ree's father would never forfeit it to the bond company unless something awful happened. With two young brothers depending on her and a mother who's entered a kind of second childhood, Ree knows she has to bring her father back, dead or alive, or else see her family turned out into the unforgiving cold.<br /><br />Sixteen-year-old Ree, who has grown up in the harsh poverty of the Ozarks, learns quickly that asking questions of the rough Dolly clan can be a fatal mistake. She perseveres past obstacles of every kind and finally confronts the top figures in the family's hierarchy.<br /><br />Along the way to a shocking revelation, Ree discovers unexpected depths in herself and in a family network that protects its own at any cost.",

    "description": "<b>From the MacArthur and Whiting Award\u2013winning author of <i>John Henry Days</i> and <i>The Intuitionist</i> comes a new, brisk, comic tour de force about identity,history, and the adhesive bandage industry<br /></b><br />When the citizens of Winthrop needed a new name for their town, they did what anyone would do\u2014they hired a consultant. The protagonist of <i>Apex Hides the Hurt </i>is a nomenclature consultant. If you want just the right name for your new product, whether it be automobile or antidepressant, sneaker or spoon, he\u2019s the man to get the job done. Wardrobe lack pizzazz? Come to the Outfit Outlet. Always the wallflower at social gatherings? Try Loquacia. And of course, whenever you take a fall, reach for Apex, because Apex Hides the Hurt. Apex is his crowning achievement, the multicultural bandage that has revolutionized the adhesive bandage industry. \u201cFlesh-colored\u201d be damned\u2014no matter what your skin tone is\u2014Apex will match it, or your money back.<br /><br />After leaving his job (following a mysterious misfortune), his expertise is called upon by the town of Winthrop. Once there, he meets the town council, who will try to sway his opinion over the coming days. Lucky Aberdeen, the millionaire software pioneer and hometown-boy-made-good, wants the name changed to something that will reflect the town\u2019s capitalist aspirations, attracting new businesses and revitalizing the community. Who could argue with that? Albie Winthrop, beloved son of the town\u2019s aristocracy, thinks Winthrop is a perfectly good name, and can\u2019t imagine what the fuss is about. Regina Goode, the mayor, is a descendent of the black settlers who founded the town, and has her own secret agenda for what the name should be. Our expert must decide the outcome, with all its implications for the town\u2019s future. Which name will he choose? Or perhaps he will devise his own? And what\u2019s with his limp, anyway?<br /><br /><i>Apex Hides the Hurt </i>brilliantly and wryly satirizes our contemporary culture, where memory and history are subsumed by the tides of marketing.",

    "description": "The text of this Norton Critical Edition is that of the corrected edition scrupulously prepared by Noel Polk, whose textual note precedes the text. David Minter's annotations are designed to assist the reader with obscure words and allusions.<br /><br />\"Backgrounds\" begins with the appendix Faulkner wrote in 1945 and sometimes referred to as another telling of <i>The Sound and the Fury</i> and includes a selection of Faulkner\u2019s letters, excerpts from two Faulkner interviews, a memoir by Faulkner's friend Ben Wasson, and both versions of Faulkner's 1933 introduction to the novel.<br /><br />\"Cultural and Historical Contexts\" presents four different perspectives, two of them new to the second edition, on the place of the American South in history. Taken together, these works\u2014by C. Vann Woodward, Richard H. King, Carolyn Porter, and Robert Penn Warren\u2014provide the reader with valuable contexts for understanding the novel.<br /><br />\"Criticism\" includes seventeen essays on <i>The Sound and the Fury</i> that collectively trace changes in the way we have viewed this novel over the last four decades. The critics are Jean-Paul Sartre, Irving Howe, Ralph Ellison, Olga W. Vickery, Cleanth Brooks, Michael Millgate, John T. Irwin, Myra Jehlen, Donald M. Kartiganer, David Minter, Warwick Wadlington, John T. Matthews, Thadious M. Davis, Wesley Morris and Barbara Alverson Morris, Minrose C. Gwin, Andr\u00e9 Bleikasten, and Philip M. Weinstein. A revised Selected Bibliography also is included.",

With his black magick and occult background the popular press began calling him \"The Wickedest Man in the World.\" This wickedness included his involvement with drug addiction, and this book brings the reader into the minds of users. It clearly explains how one can be drawn in and trapped by addictive drugs like cocaine and heroin, including why the habit is held onto while the users life is ruined. Crowley explains the use of the Will, found in some of his magickal works, in attempting to combat the problem. Considered by some his best-written work, reveals the amazing highs and the complete ruin that can follow.",

This is her trenchant report from the city where she spent the next four winters working in humanitarian aid. Investigating the city's prison for women, retraining Kabul's long-silenced English teachers, Jones enters the lives of everyday women and men and reveals through small events some big disjunctions: between the new Afghan \"democracy\" and the still-entrenched warlords, between American promises and performance, between what's boasted of and what is. At once angry, profound, and starkly beautiful, <i>Kabul in Winter</i> brings alive the people and day-to-day life of a place whose future depends upon our own.",

Thomas's unvarnished but sympathetic and fair-minded portrayal is packed with new details about Kennedy's early life and his behind-the-scenes machinations, including new revelations about the 1960 and 1968 presidential campaigns, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and his long struggles with J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon Johnson.",

Michener guides us through Alaska\u2019s fierce terrain and history, from the long-forgotten past to the bustling present. As his characters struggle for survival, Michener weaves together the exciting high points of Alaska\u2019s story: its brutal origins; the American acquisition; the gold rush; the tremendous growth and exploitation of the salmon industry; the arduous construction of the Alcan Highway, undertaken to defend the territory during World War II. A spellbinding portrait of a human community fighting to establish its place in the world, <i>Alaska </i>traces a bold and majestic saga of the enduring spirit of a land and its people.<br /> \u00a0<br /><b>Praise for <i>Alaska</i></b><br /> \u00a0<br /> \u201cFew will escape the allure of the land and people [Michener] describes. . . . <i>Alaska </i>takes the reader on a journey through one of the bleakest, richest, most foreboding, and highly inviting territories in our Republic, if not the world. . . .

    "description": "Now in paperback, with photos and maps added especially for this new edition, here is the acclaimed life story of a woman whose drive and determination inspire everyone she touches.<br /><br />Lynne Cox started swimming almost as soon as she could walk. By age sixteen, she had broken all records for swimming the English Channel. Her daring eventually led her to the Bering Strait, where she swam five miles in thirty-eight-degree water in just a swimsuit, cap, and goggles. In between those accomplishments, she became the first to swim the Strait of Magellan, narrowly escaped a shark attack off the Cape of Good Hope, and was cheered across the twenty-mile Cook Strait of New Zealand by dolphins. She even swam a mile in the Antarctic.<br /><br />Lynne writes the same way she swims, with indefatigable spirit and joy, and shares the beauty of her time in the water with a poet's eye for detail. She has accomplished yet another feat--writing a new classic of sports memoir.<br /><br />",

    "description": "Abe Ravelstein is a brilliant professor at a prominent midwestern university and a man who glories in training the movers and shakers of the political world. He has lived grandly and ferociously-and much beyond his means. His close friend Chick has suggested that he put forth a book of his convictions about the ideas which sustain humankind, or kill it, and much to Ravelstein's own surprise, he does and becomes a millionaire. Ravelstein suggests in turn that Chick write a memoir or a life of him, and during the course of a celebratory trip to Paris the two share thoughts on mortality, philosophy and history, loves and friends, old and new, and vaudeville routines from the remote past. The mood turns more somber once they have returned to the Midwest and Ravelstein succumbs to AIDS and Chick himself nearly dies.<br /><br />Deeply insightful and always moving, Saul Bellow's heartfelt novel is a journey through love and memory. It is brave, dark, and bleakly funny: an elegy to friendship and to lives well (or badly) lived.",

This Norton Critical Edition is based on the First Folio (1623) and is accompanied by detailed explanatory annotations.<br /><br />\u201cSources and Contexts\u201d offers a rich collection of texts by Ovid, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Gaspar Gil Polo, Michel de Montaigne, and William Strachey, among others, centered on the play's major themes\u2014magic and witchcraft, politics and religion, geography and travel.<br /><br />\u201cCriticism\u201d includes eighteen interpretive essays on various aspects of The Tempest by John Dryden, Nicholas Rowe, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Ludwig Tieck, Fanny Kemble, Henry James, Lytton Strachey, G. Wilson Knight, Frank Kermode, Geroeg Lemming, Barbara Mowat, David Lindley, Stephen Orgel, John Gillies, Peter Hulme, Andrew Gurr, Barbara Fuchs, and Leah Marcus.<br /><br />As a play that foregrounds the power of books, The Tempest has been an enduring source of inspiration and provocation to writers for hundreds of years. \u201cRewritings and Appropriations\u201d collects seventeen rescriptings, from John Fletcher and Philip Massinger's \"The Sea Voyage\" to Peter Greenaway's \"Prospero's Books,\" from Percy Shelley's \"With a Guitar, to Jane\" to Ted Hughes's \"Setebos.\"<br /><br />A Selected Bibliography is also included.",

    "description": "<p>The procession that crosses Chaucer's pages is as full of life and as richly textured as a medieval tapestry. The Knight, the Miller, the Friar, the Squire, the Prioress, the Wife of Bath, and others who make up the cast of characters -- including Chaucer himself -- are real people, with human emotions and weaknesses. When it is remembered that Chaucer wrote in English at a time when Latin was the standard literary language across western Europe, the magnitude of his achievement is even more remarkable. But Chaucer's genius needs no historical introduction; it bursts forth from every page of <i>The Canterbury Tales.</i><br /><br />If we trust the General Prologue, Chaucer intended that each pilgrim should tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two tales on the way back. He never finished his enormous project and even the completed tales were not finally revised. Scholars are uncertain about the order of the tales. As the printing press had yet to be invented when Chaucer wrote his works, The Canterbury Tales has been passed down in several handwritten manuscripts.</p>",

The girls live in a terrible situation: they depend on an unstable mother that has never recovered from her husband's murder, their stepfather beats them regularly, and they must forage on their own for food. <p> Stop here and you have a story told many times before, as fiction and nonfiction in tales like <i>Ellen Foster</i>, or <i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</i> --stories in which a young girl reveals the horrors of her childhood. <i>Me &amp; Emma</i> differentiates itself with a spectacular finish, shocking the reader and turning the entire story on its head. Through several twists and turns the reader learns that things are not quite the way our narrator led us to believe and everything crescendos in a way that (like all good thrillers) immediately makes you want to go back and read the whole book again from the start.</p>",

For the first time, here's an intimate autobiographical portrait of his home life, his family and his traumatic recent accident. Citing examples of his work and those of his contemporaries, King gives an excellent masterclass on writing - how to use the tools of the trade from building characters to pace and plotting as well as practical advice on presentation. And King tells readers how he got to be a No. 1 bestseller for a quarter of a century with fascinating descriptions of his own process, the origins and development of, e.g.<i>Carrie</i> and <i>Misery</i>.",

At the core of this unique collection are Saunders's travel essays based on his trips to seek out the mysteries of the \"Buddha Boy\" of Nepal; to attempt to indulge in the extravagant pleasures of Dubai; and to join the exploits of the minutemen at the Mexican border. Saunders expertly navigates the works of Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, and Esther Forbes, and leads the reader across the rocky political landscape of modern America. Emblazoned with his trademark wit and singular vision, Saunders's endeavor into the art of the essay is testament to his exceptional range and ability as a writer and thinker.",

    "description": "Luc Sante's <i>Low Life </i>is a portrait of America's greatest city, the riotous and anarchic breeding ground of modernity. This is not the familiar saga of mansions, avenues, and robber barons, but the messy, turbulent, often murderous story of the city's slums; the teeming streets--scene of innumerable cons and crimes whose cramped and overcrowded housing is still a prominent feature of the cityscape.<br /><br /><i>Low Life </i>voyages through Manhattan from four different directions. Part One examines the actual topography of Manhattan from 1840 to 1919; Part Two, the era's opportunities for vice and entertainment--theaters and saloons, opium and cocaine dens, gambling and prostitution; Part Three investigates the forces of law and order which did and didn't work to contain the illegalities; Part Four counterposes the city's tides of revolt and idealism against the city as it actually was.<br /><br /><i>Low Life</i> provides an arresting and entertaining view of what New York was actually like in its salad days. But it's more than simpy a book about New York. It's one of the most provocative books about urban life ever written--an evocation of the mythology of the quintessential modern metropolis, which has much to say not only about New York's past but about the present and future of all cities.",

Henrietta barely survived a brutal attack that killed her family. \"Rescued\" by the Social Welfare Agency, her injuries were repaired with robotic components and she was brainwashed - lost with the memory of her family's death was almost every trace of her own humanity. Today she is an extraordinarily lethal cyborg assassin, obediently working with her handler Giuseppe to carry out her deadly tasks. Despite her conditioning and programming, Henrietta still has the heart of a young girl; she has not completely forgotten how to love. Yet the very emotion is contrary to her training and programming. Can the Gunslinger Girl survive? Can she find peace in a struggle against her very nature?",

    "description": "The crown jewel of Bonhoeffer's body of work, Ethics is the culmination of his theological and personal odyssey. Based on careful reconstruction of the manuscripts, freshly and expertly translated and annotated, this new critical edition features an insightful Introduction by Clifford Green and an Afterword from the German edition's editors. Though caught up in the vortex of momentous forces in the Nazi period, Bonhoeffer systematically envisioned a radically Christocentric, incarnational ethic for a post-war world, purposefully recasting Christians' relation to history, politics, and public life. This edition allows scholars, theologians, ethicists, and serious Christians to appreciate the cogency and relevance of Bonhoeffer's vision.",

    "description": "\"Cheap grace is the mortal enemy of our church. Our struggle today is for costly grace.\" And with that sharp warning to his own church, which was engaged in bitter conflict with the official nazified state church, Dietrich Bonhoeffer began his book Discipleship (formerly entitled The Cost of Discipleship). Originally published in 1937, it soon became a classic exposition of what it means to follow Christ in a modern world beset by a dangerous and criminal government. At its center stands an interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount: what Jesus demanded of his followers-and how the life of discipleship is to be continued in all ages of the post- resurrection church. \"Every call of Jesus is a call to death,\" Bonhoeffer wrote. His own life ended in martyrdom on April 9, 1945. Freshly translated from the German critical edition, Discipleship provides a more accurate rendering of the text and extensive aids and commentary to clarify the meaning, context, and reception of this work and its attempt to resist the Nazi ideology then infecting German Christian churches.",

Acute and subtle, warm and perceptive, yet also profoundly moving, the documents collectively tell a very human story of loss, of courage, and of hope. Now reissued with a new Preface, by one of his leading interpreters. Bonhoeffer's story seems as vitally relevant, as politically prophetic, and as theologically significant, as it did yesterday.",

    "description": "Many appreciate Richard P. Feynman's contributions to twentieth-century physics, but few realize how engaged he was with the world around him\u2014how deeply and thoughtfully he considered the religious, political, and social issues of his day. Now, a wonderful book\u2014based on a previously unpublished, three-part public lecture he gave at the University of Washington in 1963\u2014shows us this other side of Feynman, as he expounds on the inherent conflict between science and religion, people's distrust of politicians, and our universal fascination with flying saucers, faith healing, and mental telepathy. Here we see Feynman in top form: nearly bursting into a Navajo war chant, then pressing for an overhaul of the English language (if you want to know why Johnny can't read, just look at the spelling of \u201cfriend\u201d); and, finally, ruminating on the death of his first wife from tuberculosis. This is quintessential Feynman\u2014reflective, amusing, and ever enlightening.",

But from the first, eight-year-old Stevie's life there is an unending parade of misery and disaster.<br /><br />Cruelly ostracized at his school, Stevie retreats further and further into himself -- and into a strange computer game and a group of imaginary friends.<br /><br />But there is something eerie about his loyal, invisible new playmates: each shares the name of a child who has recently vanished from the sleepy Southern town. And terror grows for Step and DeAnne as the truth slowly unfolds. For their son has found something savagely evil ... and it's coming for Stevie next.",

    "description": "An underemployed, skateboarding party animal, Colby Buzzell traded a dead-end future for the army--and ended up as a machine gunner in Iraq. To make sense of the absurd and frightening events surrounding him, he started writing a blog about the war--and how it differed from the government's official version. But as his blog's popularity grew, Buzzell became the embedded reporter the Army couldn't control--despite its often hilarious efforts to do so. The result is an extraordinary narrative, rich with unforgettable scenes: the Iraqi woman crying uncontrollably during a raid on her home; the soldier too afraid to fight; the troops chain-smoking in a guard tower and counting tracer rounds; the first, fierce firefight against the \"men in black.\" Drawing comparisons to everything from Charles Bukowski to <b>Catch-22</b>, <b>My War</b> depicts a generation caught in a complicated and dangerous world--and marks the debut of a raw, remarkable new voice.",

    "description": "\"Essence of Decision\" is both a vivid account of a crucial international event and a breakthrough in the application of organizational and political theory to events. Professor Allison analyzes the Cuban missile crisis in terms of three alternative frames of reference. By examining it first through one set of conceptual lenses, then through a second, and finally through a third, he explores some of the fundamental yet often unrecognized choices among the categories and assumptions that channel our thinking and thus influence our decisions and the outcomes in situations such as the missile crisis.",

    "description": "Rachel Simon's sister Beth is a spirited woman who lives intensely and often joyfully, despite her intellectual disability. Beth spends her days riding the buses in her Pennsylvania city. The drivers, a lively group, are her mentors; her fellow passengers are her community. One day, Beth asked Rachel to accompany her on the buses for an entire year; the book is the chronicle of that remarkable time. Rachel, a writer and college teacher whose hyperbusy life camouflaged her emotional isolation, had much to learn in her sister's extraordinary world. Here are life lessons from which every reader can profit: how to live in the moment, how to pay attention to what really matters, how to change, how to love, \u0097and how to slow down and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Simon elegantly braids together riveting memories of terrifying maternal abandonment, fierce sisterly loyalty, and astonishing forgiveness. She brings to light the almost invisible world of mental retardation, finds unlikely heroes in everyday life, and portrays her very special sister Beth as the endearing and indomitable person she is. This heartwarming book takes the reader on an inspirational journey, at once unique and universal.<br />",

The Tillermans \u2013 all of them, including Gram and Momma and Bullet \u2013 are not people who have things easy, or make things easy on themselves. These books tell the various stories of this family, and of their friends, too.",

Dicey's Song, A Solitary Blue, and Come a Stranger are the most interlocked and can be read in any order following Homecoming and before Sons from Afar and Seventeen Against the Dealer. The Runner is a standalone novel and the events in it take place about ten years before Homecoming.",

    "description": "Stanley Booth, a member of the Rolling Stones\u2019 inner circle, met the band just a few months before Brian Jones drowned in a swimming pool in 1968. He lived with them throughout their 1969 American tour, staying up all night together listening to blues, talking about music, ingesting drugs, and consorting with groupies. His thrilling account culminates with their final concert at Altamont Speedway\u2014a nightmare of beating, stabbing, and killing that would signal the end of a generation\u2019s dreams of peace and freedom. But while this book renders in fine detail the entire history of the Stones, paying special attention to the tragedy of Brian Jones, it is about much more than a writer and a rock band. It has been called\u2014by Harold Brodkey and Robert Stone, among others\u2014the best book ever written about the sixties. In Booth\u2019s new afterword, he finally explains why it took him 15 years to write the book, relating an astonishing story of drugs, jails, and disasters.<br />",

    "description": "Layla is torn between clashing identities - the dutiful Muslim daughter her immigrant parents raised her to be, the Indian she fantasizes she is, and the free, independent woman America has awakened in her. At nineteen, her parents inform Layla that a marriage has been arranged for her. Her wedding will be in India, to Sameer, a handsome, ambitious Indian engineer, who knows nothing of Layla's American self and who has some potent secrets of his own. A stunned Layla submits reluctantly, but not before she commits a dangerous, final act of defiance. In the heat and noise of Hyderabad, as her wedding looms, her behaviour becomes more erratic. Her mother, fearing demonic possession, takes Layla on a series of visits to alims - Muslim faith healers - hoping to exorcise all traces of rebellion. To Layla's surprise, the ancient and elaborate wedding rituals, her groom's physical beauty, and the warm welcome of her new family fill her with a sense of belonging she has never known before. outside, the full horror of the devil's bargain she has made is revealed, forcing her to make painful decisions about her roles as a Muslim, a wife and a woman. Set against the backdrop of the ancient walled city of Hyderabad and mounting Hindu-Muslim tensions, MADRAS ON RAINY DAYS, lyrically evokes the complexities of life behind the chador. It is a gorgeously written novel by an original new voice in international fiction.",

    "description": "You might expect the fact of dying--the dying of a beloved wife and fellow poet--to make for a bleak and lonely tale. But Donald Hall's poignant and courageous poetry, facing that dread fact, involves us all: the magnificent, humorous, and gifted woman, Jane Kenyon, who suffered and died; the doctors and nurses who tried but failed to save her; the neighbors, friends, and relatives who grieved for her; the husband who sat by her while she lived and afterward sat in their house alone with his pain, self-pity, and fury; and those of us who till now had nothing to do with it. As Donald Hall writes, \"Remembered happiness is agony; so is remembered agony.\" Without will touch every feeling reader, for everyone has suffered loss and requires the fellowship of elegy. In the earth's oldest poem, when Gilgamesh howls of the death of Enkidu, a grieving reader of our own time may feel a kinship, across the abyss of four thousand years, with a Sumerian king. In Without Donald Hall speaks to us all of grief, as a poet lamenting the death of a poet, as a husband mourning the loss of a wife. Without is Hall's greatest and most honorable achievement -- his give and testimony, his lament and his celebration of loss and of love.",

    "description": "A number-one <i>New York Times</i> bestseller when it was originally published, <i>The Silmarillion</i> is the core of J.R.R. Tolkien's imaginative writing, a work whose origins stretch back to a time long before <i>The Hobbit</i>.<br /><br />Tolkien considered <i>The Silmarillion</i> his most important work, and, though it was published last and posthumously, this great collection of tales and legends clearly sets the stage for all his other writing. The story of the creation of the world and of the First Age, this is the ancient drama to which the characters in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> look back and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part. The three Silmarils were jewels created by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. Thereafter, the unsullied Light of Valinor live on only in the Silmarils, but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, which was guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. <i>The Silmarillion</i> is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all their heroism, against the great Enemy.<br /><br />This second edition features a letter written by J.R.R. Tolkein describing his intentions for the book, which serves as a brilliant exposition of his conception of the earlier Ages of Middle-earth.",

    "description": "One of the most remarkable philosophical works of the nineteenth century, famed for the depth and acuity of its modern psychological insights<br /><br />Writing under the pseudonym Anti-Climacus, Kierkegaard explores the concept of \"despair,\" alerting readers to the diversity of ways in which they may be described as living in this state of bleak abandonment\u2014including some that may seem just the opposite\u2014and offering a much-discussed formula for the eradication of despair. With its penetrating account of the self, this late work by Kierkegaard was hugely influential upon twentieth-century philosophers including Karl Jaspers, Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. The Sickness unto Death can be regarded as one of the key works of theistic existentialist thought\u2014a brilliant and revelatory answer to one man's struggle to fill the spiritual void.<br /><br />For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

It changed my whole perspective of myself as a woman.\"-Jada Pinkett-Smith <br />At nineteen, bell hooks began writing the book that forever changed the course of feminist thought. Ain't I a Woman remains a classic analysis of the impact of sexism on black women during slavery, the historic devaluation of black womanhood, black male sexism, racism within the women's movement, and black women's involvement with feminism. <br />bell hooks is the author of numerous critically acclaimed and influential books on the politics of race, gender, class, and culture.

    "description": "<i>When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost</i> is a decidedly intimate look into the life of the modern black woman: a complex world where feminists often have not-so-clandestine affairs with the most sexist of men; where women who treasure their independence often prefer men who pick up the tab; where the deluge of babymothers and babyfathers reminds black women, who long for marriage, that traditional nuclear families are a reality for less than 40 percent of the African-American population; and where black women are forced to make sense of a world where \"truth is no longer black and white but subtle, intriguing shades of gray.\" Morgan ushers in a voice that, like hiphop - the cultural movement that defines her generation - samples and layers many voices, and injects its sensibilities into the old and flips it into something new, provocative, and powerful.",

    "description": "When Noire, a hip, Afro-wearing Ph.D. student, walks into Brown Betty Books, her righteousness kicks in to overdrive amid the self-identified \"talented tenth\" who wear their double degrees and five-hundred-dollar shoes like badges of honor. And then Innocent, a well-heeled investment banker from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, West Africa, walks in and turns her on her head. Innocent seems interested in her -- but he's one of them.<br /><br />Before meeting him, Noire shunned the \"bourgie\" world of black-moneyed cosmopolitans like Innocent, opting instead for socially conscious (but economically challenged) artists and urban intellectuals. Their mutual attraction blossoms into lust -- and eventually love -- but it lives in the shifting sands of personal beliefs and professional ambitions that are often at odds.<br /><br />Set in New York City with jaunts to Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean, <em>A Love Noire</em> is the story of an unlikely couple that transcends all they've known to learn the redemptive power of love.",

    "description": "<b>\"A brilliant account of the politics of shit. It will leave you speechless.\"</b><br /><br />Written in Paris after the heady days of student revolt in May 1968 and before the devastation of the AIDS epidemic, History of Shit is emblematic of a wild and adventurous strain of 1970s' theoretical writing that attempted to marry theory, politics, sexuality, pleasure, experimentation, and humor. Radically redefining dialectical thought and post-Marxist politics, it takes an important--and irreverent--position alongside the works of such postmodern thinkers as Foucault, Deleuze, Guattari, and Lyotard. Laporte's eccentric style and ironic sensibility combine in an inquiry that is provocative, humorous, and intellectually exhilarating. Debunking all humanist mythology about the grandeur of civilization, History of Shit suggests instead that the management of human waste is crucial to our identities as modern individuals--including the organization of the city, the rise of the nation-state, the development of capitalism, and the mandate for clean and proper language. Far from rising above the muck, Laporte argues, we are thoroughly mired in it, particularly when we appear our most clean and hygienic. Laporte's style of writing is itself an attack on our desire for \"clean language.\" Littered with lengthy quotations and obscure allusions, and adamantly refusing to follow a linear argument, History of Shit breaks the rules and challenges the conventions of \"proper\" academic discourse.",

    "description": "Miniature books, eighteenth-century novels, Tom Thumb weddings, tall tales, and objects of tourism and nostalgia: this diverse group of cultural forms is the subject of <i>On Longing</i>, a fascinating analysis of the ways in which everyday objects are narrated to animate or realize certain versions of the world. Originally published in 1984 (Johns Hopkins University Press), and now available in paperback for the first time, this highly original book draws on insights from semiotics and from psychoanalytic, feminist, and Marxist criticism. Addressing the relations of language to experience, the body to scale, and narratives to objects, Susan Stewart looks at the \"miniature\" as a metaphor for interiority and at the \"gigantic\" as an exaggeration of aspects of the exterior. In the final part of her essay Stewart examines the ways in which the \"souvenir\" and the \"collection\" are objects mediating experience in time and space.",

Gemma Doyle is looking forward to a holiday from Spence Academy, spending time with her friends in the city, attending ritzy balls, and on a somber note, tending to her ailing father. As she prepares to ring in the New Year, 1896, a handsome young man, Lord Denby, has set his sights on Gemma, or so it seems. Yet amidst the distractions of London, Gemma\u2019s visions intensify\u2013visions of three girls dressed in white, to whom something horrific has happened, something only the realms can explain...<br /><br />The lure is strong, and before long, Gemma, Felicity, and Ann are turning flowers into butterflies in the enchanted world of the realms that Gemma alone can bring them to. To the girls\u2019 great joy, their beloved Pippa is there as well, eager to complete their circle of friendship.<br /><br />But all is not well in the realms\u2013or out. The mysterious Kartik has reappeared, telling Gemma she must find the Temple and bind the magic, else great disaster will befall her. Gemma\u2019s willing to do his intrusive bidding, despite the dangers it brings, for it means she will meet up with her mother\u2019s greatest friend\u2013and now her foe, Circe. Until Circe is destroyed, Gemma cannot live out her destiny. But finding Circe proves a most perilous task.",

    "description": "Dear Reader,<br /><br />Considering that I'm married to Cedar Cove's private investigator, you might think I enjoy mysteries.<br />But I don't -- especially when they involve us!<br />Roy's been receiving anonymous postcards and messages asking if we \"regret the past.\"<br />We don't know what they mean....<br /><br />On a more positive note, we're both delighted that our daughter, Linnette, has moved to Cedar Cove to work at the new medical clinic. A while ago I attended the humane society's \"Dog and Bachelor Auction,\" where I bought her a date with Cal Washburn, who works at Cliff Harding's horse farm. Unfortunately Linnette is less enthusiastic about this date than I am.<br /><br />Speaking of Cliff, the romance between him and Grace Sherman is back on. But that's only one of the many interesting stories here in Cedar Cove. So why don't you drop by for a coffee at my husband's office on Main Street or our house on Harbor and I'll tell you everything that's new!<br /><br />Corrie",

But when Brad's ex-wife reappears, Lydia is suddenly afraid to trust her newfound happiness.Three women join Lydia's newest class. Elise Beaumont, retired and bitterly divorced, learns that her onetime husband is reentering her life. Bethanne Hamlin is facing the fallout from a much more recent divorce. And Courtney Pulanski is a depressed and overweight teenager, whose grandmother's idea of helping her is to drag her to seniors' swim sessions-and to the knitting class at A Good Yarn.",

    "description": "The bestselling book on childhood trauma and the enduring effects of repressed anger and pain<br /><br />Why are many of the most successful people plagued by feelings of emptiness and alienation? This wise and profound book has provided millions of readers with an answer--and has helped them to apply it to their own lives.<br /><br />Far too many of us had to learn as children to hide our own feelings, needs, and memories skillfully in order to meet our parents' expectations and win their \"love.\" Alice Miller writes, \"When I used the word 'gifted' in the title, I had in mind neither children who receive high grades in school nor children talented in a special way. I simply meant all of us who have survived an abusive childhood thanks to an ability to adapt even to unspeakable cruelty by becoming numb.... Without this 'gift' offered us by nature, we would not have survived.\" But merely surviving is not enough. The Drama of the Gifted Child helps us to reclaim our life by discovering our own crucial needs and our own truth.",

And when it comes to girls named Katherine, Colin is always getting dumped. Nineteen times, to be exact.<br /><br />On a road trip miles from home, this anagram-happy, washed-up child prodigy has ten thousand dollars in his pocket, a bloodthirsty feral hog on his trail, and an overweight, Judge Judy-loving best friend riding shotgun--but no Katherines. Colin is on a mission to prove The Theorem of Underlying Katherine Predictability, which he hopes will predict the future of any relationship, avenge Dumpees everywhere, and finally win him the girl.<br /><br />Love, friendship, and a dead Austro-Hungarian archduke add up to surprising and heart-changing conclusions in this ingeniously layered comic novel about reinventing oneself.",

She guides us through the ruins and construction sites of post-communist cities--St. Petersburg, Moscow, Berlin, and Prague--and the imagined homelands of exiles-Benjamin, Nabokov, Mandelstahm, and Brodsky. From Jurassic Park to the Totalitarian Sculpture Garden, Boym unravels the threads of this global epidemic of longing and its antidotes.",

    "description": "<b>'I wish Mr Trollope would go on writing <i>Framley Parsonage</i> for ever'--Elizabeth Gaskell</b><br /><p>The fourth of the Barsetshire Chronicles, <i>Framley Parsonage</i> was published in 1860 to wide acclaim and has always been one of Trollope's most popular novels. In it the values of a Victorian clergyman Mark Robarts, are put to the test. Through a combination of naivety and social ambition, Robarts is compromised and brought to the brink of ruin. Trollope tells his story with great compassion, offsetting the drama with his customary humour. Like all the Barsetshire novels, it is an extraordinarily evocative picture of everyday life in nineteenth-century England.<br /></p><p>The only printing of <i>Framley Parsonage</i> that Trollope himself supervised was the serial version in the <i>Cornhill Magazine.</i> The editors of this edition have returned to that text and thus present Trollope's work as he himself would have wished, avoiding hundreds of later corruptions and restoring a number of manuscript readings.</p>",

But the Solos draw the line when they discover the rebels\u2019 plot to make the Hapan Consortium an ally\u2013which rests upon Hapan nobles murdering their pro-Alliance queen and her daughter.<br /><br />Yet the Solos\u2019 selfless determination to save the queen cannot dispel the inescapable consequences of their actions, that will pit mother against son and brother against sister in the battles ahead. For as Jacen Solo\u2019s dark powers grow stronger under the Dark Jedi Lumiya, and his influence over Ben Skywalker becomes more insidious, Luke\u2019s concern for his nephew forces him into a life-and-death struggle against his fiercest foe, and Han and Leia Solo find themselves at the mercy of their deadliest enemy . . . their son.",

    "description": "In simple, mesmerizing prose, Hermann Hesse's <i>Journey to the East</i> tells of a journey both geographic and spiritual. H.H., a German choirmaster, is invited on an expedition with the League, a secret society whose members include Paul Klee, Mozart, and Albertus Magnus. The participants traverse both space and time, encountering Noah's Ark in Zurich and Don Quixote at Bremgarten. The pilgrims' ultimate destination is the East, the \"Home of the Light,\" where they expect to find spiritual renewal. Yet the harmony that ruled at the outset of the trip soon degenerates into an opening conflict. Each traveler finds the rest of the group intolerable and heads off in his own direction, with H.H. bitterly blaming the others for the failure of the journey. It is only long after the trip, while poring over records in the League archives, that H.H. discovers his own role in the dissolution of the group, and the ominous significance of the journey itself.",

    "description": "An intensely stirring coming-of-age memoir by Alison Smith, <i>Name All the Animals</i> brilliantly explores the power and limitations of a family's faith. Smith was 15 when her older brother, Roy, was killed in a car accident, and her memoir follows her family as they attempt to put their lives back together. Her parents try to take comfort in their strong Catholic faith but are nonetheless shattered. For her part, Smith wonders why God has abandoned her. She finds cold comfort in Catholic symbols and rituals, feeling a connection to Roy only when she enters the old fort they had built together. <br /><br />An engaging storyteller, Smith crafts her memoir to read like a novel, interspersing moving flashbacks of the times she spent with her brother with amusing portraits of the nuns at her parochial school, who sneak out of the infirmary to play cards and make autumnal visits to a secret swimming pool. As a child, Smith wonders why her father blesses her and Roy every morning, touching a relic to their foreheads, mouths, and hands, mentioning each individual body part. \"He's got to name us, like Adam named the animals,\" Roy explained. \"To keep track of them.\" The near impossibility of \"keeping track,\" and the changing nature of faith are just two of the poignant messages in this unforgettable debut.",

    "description": "Now the incomparable team of psychologist Alex Delaware and homicide cop Milo Sturgis embark on their most dangerous excursion yet, into the dark places where risk runs high and blood runs cold ... a story tailor-made for the nightly news: Dylan Meserve and Michaela Brand, young lovers and fellow acting students, vanish on the way home from a rehearsal. Three days later, the two of them are found in the remote mountains of Malibu --- battered and terrified after a harrowing ordeal at the hands of a sadistic abductor. <br /><br />The details of the nightmarish event are shocking and brutal: The couple was carjacked at gunpoint by a masked assailant and subjected to a horrific regimen of confinement, starvation and assault. But before long, doubts arise about the couple's story, and as forensic details unfold, the abduction is exposed as a hoax. Charged as criminals themselves, the aspiring actors claim emotional problems, and the court orders psychological evaluation for both. <br /><br />Michaela is examined by Alex Delaware, who finds that her claims of depression and stress ring true enough. But they don't explain her lies, and Alex is certain that there are hidden layers in this sordid psychodrama that even he hasn't been able to penetrate. Nevertheless, the case is closed --- only to be violently reopened when Michaela is savagely murdered. When the police look for Dylan, they find that he's gone. Is he the killer or a victim himself? Casting their dragnet into the murkiest corners of L.A., Delaware and Sturgis unearth more questions than answers --- including a host of eerily identical killings. What really happened to the couple who cried wolf? And what bizarre and brutal epidemic is infecting the city with terror, madness, and sudden, twisted death?",

The elder race of our galaxy, the Arisians, using advanced mental science, has foreseen the invasion of our universe by the evil Eddorians. The Arisians begin a breeding program on every world that can produce intelligent life, the goal to produce super warriors who can repel the Eddorians. Triplanetary is the early history of that breeding program on Earth, illustrated with the lives of several warriors and soldiers. It ends with the discovery of the interstellar space drive, formation of the Galactic Patrol, and the first Lens-an Arisian device that provides its wearer with mind-reading and telepathic abilities-given to the first Lensman on Earth.",

    "description": "\"Although I cannot tell for certain what sparked my interest in the neural underpinnings of reason, I do know when I became convinced that the traditional views on the nature of rationality could not be correct.\" Thus begins a book that takes the reader on a journey of discovery, from the story of Phineas Gage, the famous nineteenth-century case of behavioral change that followed brain damage, to the contemporary recreation of Gage's brain; and from the doubts of a young neurologist to a testable hypothesis concerning the emotions and their fundamental role in rational human behavior. Drawing on his experiences with neurological patients affected by brain damage (his laboratory is recognized worldwide as the foremost center for the study of such patients), Antonio Damasio shows how the absence of emotion and feeling can break down rationality. In the course of explaining how emotions and feelings contribute to reason and to adaptive social behavior, Damasio also offers a novel perspective on what emotions and feelings actually are: a direct sensing of our own body states, a link between the body and its survival-oriented regulations, on the one hand, and consciousness, on the other. Descartes' Error leads us to conclude that human organisms are endowed from the very beginning with a spirited passion for making choices, which the social mind can use to build rational behavior.",

    "description": "As summer begins on Osprey Island, preparations at the Lodge -- the island\u2019s one and only hotel \u2014 are underway for the busy season. On maintenance and housekeeping there\u2019s Lance and Lorna Squire, Osprey locals and raging drinkers; and their irrepressible son Squee. There are college boys to wait tables and Irish girls to clean rooms. And a few unusual returnees, too: Suzy Chizek, single mom and daughter of the Lodge\u2019s owners, who\u2019s looking for a parentally funded vacation; and Roddy Jacobs, another former local, who has come back after a mysterious twenty-year absence. But when tragedy strikes, dark secrets explode, dividing the island community over the fate of a young boy suddenly more vulnerable to his violent father than ever. In the uniquely ephemeral atmosphere of a summer resort, Thisbe Nissen unfolds, with charecteristic warmth and charm, an ever-deepening story of lost loves and found romance, of loyalties and betrayals; and of lingering\u2013sometimes fleeting\u2013joy.",

    "description": "Paris, 1796. Aristide Ravel, freelance undercover police agent and investigator, is confronted with a double murder in a fashionable apartment. The victims prove to be C\u00e9lie Montereau, the daughter of a wealthy and influential family, and the man who was blackmailing her.<br /><br />C\u00e9lie's enigmatic and bitter friend Rosalie Cl\u00e9ment provides Aristide with intelligence that steers him toward Philippe Aubry, a young man with a violent past who had been in love with C\u00e9lie. According to an eyewitness, however, Aubry could not have murdered C\u00e9lie. As time passes, Aristide finds himself falling in love with Rosalie, albeit reluctantly, as he suspects that she knows more about the murders than she will say.<br /><br />When Aristide uncovers evidence that points to Rosalie herself, he must learn whom she is protecting and why before he can obtain justice for C\u00e9lie and save Rosalie from the guillotine. From the gritty back alleys of Paris to its glittering salons and caf\u00e9s, through the heart of the feverish, decadent society of post-revolutionary France, Aristide's investigation leads him into a puzzle involving hidden secrets, crimes of passion, and long-nurtured hatreds.<br /><br />With elaborate French cultural atmosphere, author Susanne Alleyn has created a sophisticated and stylish mystery set in the uneasy and turbulent years between the Terror and the rise of Napoleon.",

    "description": "A bold translation of Nobel Prize-winner Herman Hesse\u2019s most inspirational and beloved work in a Penguin Classics deluxe edition. Nominated as one of America\u2019s best-loved novels by PBS\u2019s <i>The Great American Read</i><br /><br />Hesse\u2019s famous and influential novel, <i>Siddartha</i>, is perhaps the most important and compelling moral allegory our troubled century has produced. Integrating Eastern and Western spiritual traditions with psychoanalysis and philosophy, this strangely simple tale, written with a deep and moving empathy for humanity, has touched the lives of millions since its original publication in 1922. Set in India, Siddhartha is the story of a young Brahmin\u2019s search for ultimate reality after meeting with the Buddha. His quest takes him from a life of decadence to asceticism, through the illusory joys of sensual love with a beautiful courtesan, and of wealth and fame, to the painful struggles with his son and the ultimate wisdom of renunciation. This new translation by award-winning translator Joachim Neugroschel includes an introduction by Hesse biographer Ralph Freedman.",

    "description": "From a world-renowned expert on mosquitoes and a prize-winning reporter comes a fascinating work of popular science -- a comprehensive study of the insect itself, its role in history, and its threat to mankind.From its irritating whine to the sting and itch of its bite, the mosquito ranks near the bottom of mankind's list of favorite creatures. But these tiny insects, once merely a seasonal annoyance, now are capturing headlines worldwide as new information emerges about the diseases they carry, their migratory population, and their growing resistance to pesticides.<br /><br />Harvard professor Andrew Spielman has dedicated his life to understanding this insect, a passion that makes him the perfect guide to their amazing world and the perfect author of this lively, accessible book that offers an intriguing and horrifying mosquito-eye view of nature and man. He explains where mosquitoes breed, and how they die, showing us their natural foes and man-made enemies while explaining the myriad diseases they bring to all corners of the world. Spielman offers colorful examples of how the mosquito has insinuated itself into human history, from the defeat of Sir Francis Drake's fleet to the death of thousands of Frenchmen working on the Panama Canal to the recent widespread West Nile panic in New York City. Filled with little-known facts and illuminating anecdotes that bring this tiny being into larger focus, <em>Mosquito</em> offers fascinating, alarming, and convincing evidence that the sooner we get to know this little creature, the better off we'll be.",

Dogs, birds, horses, automobiles, and the weather are some of the recycled elements in Marcus's first collection\u2014part fiction, part handbook\u2014as familiar objects take on markedly unfamiliar meanings. Gradually, this makeshift world, in its defiance of the laws of physics and language, finds a foundation in its own implausibility, as Marcus produces new feelings and sensations\u2014both comic and disturbing\u2014in the definitive guide to an unpredictable yet exhilarating plane of existence.",

    "description": "Now in a revised tenth-anniversary edition, The Lucifer Principle is a revolutionary work that explores the intricate relationships among genetics, human behavior, and culture to argue that evil is woven into our biological fabric. Intensely controversial and polarizing upon its initial publication, The Lucifer Principle is a sweeping narrative that challenges some of our most popular scientific assumptions. Drawing on evidence ranging from studies of the most primitive organisms to those on ants, apes, and humankind, Howard Bloom argues that nature uses evil not to destroy but to create and to build, moving the human world to greater heights of organization, intricacy, and power. In this special revised edition, Bloom provides a new introduction detailing the book's enduring impact and an extensive afterword discussing its relevance in a post9/11 world and the current state of Islamic militancy versus Islamic moderates.",

    "description": "<em>When and Where I Enter</em> is an eloquent testimonial to the profound influence of African-American women on race and women's movements throughout American history. Drawing on speeches, diaries, letters, and other original documents, Paula Giddings powerfully portrays how black women have transcended racist and sexist attitudes--often confronting white feminists and black male leaders alike--to initiate social and political reform. From the open disregard for the rights of slave women to examples of today's more covert racism and sexism in civil rights and women'sorganizations, Giddings illuminates the black woman's crusade for equality. In the process, she paints unforgettable portraits of black female leaders, such as anti-lynching activist Ida B. Wells, educator and FDR adviser Mary McLeod Bethune, and the heroic civil rights leader Fannie Lou Hamer, among others, who fought both overt and institutionalized oppression.<br /><br /><em>When and Where I Enter</em> reveals the immense moral power black women possessed and sought to wield throughout their history--the same power that prompted Anna Julia Cooper in 1892 to tell a group of black clergymen, \"Only the black woman can say 'when and where I enter, in the quiet, undisputed dignity of my womanhood, without violence and without suing or special patronage, then and there the whole . . . race enters with me.'\"",

    "description": "<i>Sex and the City</i> meets Jane Austen in a wickedly funny, razor-sharp novel about the fortunes and misfortunes, expectations and regrets of seven women who shared long-ago summers at an elite Jewish girls\u2019 camp. <b>\n  <br /></b><br />Anyone who\u2019s ever wondered what happened to the girls in the exclusive cliques of adolescence will delight in <i>The J.A.P. Chronicles</i>. With the wry wit and keen eye and ear of a latter-day Jane Austen, Isabel Rose (herself a scion of a prominent New York family) provides the ultimate insider\u2019s look at the glamorous upper-crust society that even Carrie Bradshaw would give her Jimmy Choos to join. <br /><br />When seven former bunkmates at Willow Lake Camp reunite for the camp\u2019s one hundredth anniversary, the event brings more than just a revival of the old camp spirit. Ali Cohen, an Oscar-nominated filmmaker and former camp outcast, plans to make a documentary about her former bunkmates. The ugly duckling turned successful self-made swan secretly hopes that that her teenage tormentors will have grown into adult losers.<br /><br />As each woman steps into focus, however, it becomes clear that it is not quite that simple. Sure, Arden can\u2019t keep a job (even as a nanny!), Jessica is stuck in regional theater, and Dafna has lost both her job and her $20,000 per month stipend from her father. But Laura is apparently flourishing as a Los Angeles superagent, and Beth has found happiness by throwing over her dull but successful fianc\u00e9 for her wedding photographer. Even Wendy, golden girl turned Short Hills housewife, has managed to skirt around old regrets and long-stifled urges\u2014until seeing an old acquaintance stirs them up again.<b>\n  <br /></b><br />Funny, smart, and ultimately moving, <i>The J.A.P. Chronicles</i> opens a whole new perspective on the girls from the \u201cbest families\u201d and on the money, culture, and expectations that define their lives.",

    "description": "\"I have no wish to play the pontificating fool, pretending that I've suddenly come up with the answers to all life's questions. Quite the contrary, I began this book as an exploration, an exercise in selfquestioning. In other words, I wanted to find out, as I looked back at a long and complicated life, with many twists and turns, how well I've done at measuring up to the values I myself have set.\"In this luminous memoir, a true American icon looks back on his celebrated life and career. His body of work is arguably the most morally significant in cinematic history, and the power and influence of that work are indicative of the character of the man behind the many storied roles. Sidney Poitier here explores these elements of character and personal values to take his own measure--as a man, as a husband and father, and as an actor.<br /><br />Poitier credits his parents and his childhood on tiny Cat Island in the Bahamas for equipping him with the unflinching sense of right and wrong and of selfworth that he has never surrendered and that have dramatically shaped his world. \"In the kind of place where I grew up,\" recalls Poitier, \"what's coming at you is the sound of the sea and the smell of the wind and momma's voice and the voice of your dad and the craziness of your brothers and sisters ... and that's it.\" Without television, radio, and material distractions to obscure what matters most, he could enjoy the simple things, endure the long commitments, and find true meaning in his life.<br /><br />Poitier was uncompromising as he pursued a personal and public life that would honor his upbringing and the invaluable legacy of his parents just a few years after his introduction to indoor plumbing and theautomobile, Poitier broke racial barrier after racial barrier to launch a pioneering acting career. Committed to the notion that what one does for a living articulates who one is, Poitier played only forceful and affecting characters who said something positive, useful, and lasting about the human condition.<br /><br />Here, finally, is Poitier's own introspective look at what has informed his performances and his life. Poitier explores the nature of sacrifice and commitment, pride and humility, rage and forgiveness, and paying the price for artistic integrity, What emerges is a picture of a man seeking truth, passion, and balance in the face of limits--his own and the world's. A triumph of the spirit, \"The Measure of a Man\" captures the essential Poitier.",

    "description": "This is the story of a political miracle--the perfect match of man and moment.<br /><br />Franklin Delano Roosevelt took office in March of 1933 as America touched bottom. Banks were closing everywhere. Millions of people lost everything. The Great Depression had caused a national breakdown. With the craft of a master storyteller, Jonathan Alter brings us closer than ever before to the Roosevelt magic. Facing the gravest crisis since the Civil War, FDR used his cagey political instincts and ebullient temperament in the storied first Hundred Days of his presidency to pull off an astonishing conjuring act that lifted the country and saved both democracy and capitalism.<br /><br />Who was this man? To revive the nation when it felt so hopeless took an extraordinary display of optimism and self-confidence. Alter shows us how a snobbish and apparently lightweight young aristocrat was forged into an incandescent leader by his domineering mother; his independent wife; his eccentric top adviser, Louis Howe; and his ally-turned-bitter-rival, Al Smith, the Tammany Hall street fighter FDR had to vanquish to complete his preparation for the presidency.<br /><br />\"Old Doc Roosevelt\" had learned at Warm Springs, Georgia, how to lift others who suffered from polio, even if he could not cure their paralysis, or his own. He brought the same talents to a larger stage. Derided as weak and unprincipled by pundits, Governor Roosevelt was barely nominated for president in 1932. As president-elect, he escaped assassination in Miami by inches, then stiffed President Herbert Hoover's efforts to pull him into cooperating with him to deal with a terrifying crisis. In the most tumultuous and dramatic presidential transition in history, the entire banking structure came tumbling down just hours before FDR's legendary \"only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" Inaugural Address.<br /><br />In a major historical find, Alter unearths the draft of a radio speech in which Roosevelt considered enlisting a private army of American Legion veterans on his first day in office. He did not. Instead of circumventing Congress and becoming the dictator so many thought they needed, FDR used his stunning debut to experiment. He rescued banks, put men to work immediately, and revolutionized mass communications with pioneering press conferences and the first Fireside Chat. As he moved both right and left, Roosevelt's insistence on \"action now\" did little to cure the Depression, but he began to rewrite the nation's social contract and lay the groundwork for his most ambitious achievements, including Social Security.<br /><br />From one of America's most respected journalists, rich in insights and with fresh documentation and colorful detail, this thrilling story of presidential leadership--of what government is for--resonates through the events of today. It deepens our understanding of how Franklin Delano Roosevelt restored hope and transformed America.<br /><br /><i>The Defining Moment</i> will take its place among our most compelling works of political history.",

During the last year of the Great Tribulation, safe houses are no longer safe, and the cast of characters dramatically changes. By the time of the war of the great day of God the Almighty, the globe has become a powder keg of danger. Except those already in Petra, everyone has been forced to relocate as Antichrist ratchets up the pressure in the world's most treacherous game. Who will be left standing when the battle leaves the Tribulation Force on the brink of the end of time and the Glorious Appearing?",

    "description": "Guided by Voices was one of the most popular indie-rock bands of the 1990s. Critics internationally have lauded the band\u2019s brain trust, Robert Pollard, as a once-in-a-generation artist. Pollard has been compared by <i>The New York Times</i> to Mozart, Rossini, and Paul McCartney (in the same sentence) and everyone from P. J. Harvey, Radiohead, R.E.M., the Strokes, and U2 has sung his praises and cited his music as an influence. But it all started rather prosaically when Pollard, a fourth-grade teacher in his early thirties from Dayton, Ohio, began recording songs with drinking buddies in his basement. James Greer, an acclaimed music writer and former <i>Spin</i> editor, enjoys a unique advantage in having played in the band for two years. This personal connection grants him unparalleled insight and complete access to the workings of Pollard\u2019s muse.",

    "description": "Marc Woodworth's book covers the album's long and unorthodox period of writing, recording, sequencing, and editing. It includes interviews with members of the band, manager Pete Jamison, web-master and GBV historian Rich Turiel and Robert Griffin of Scat Records. At least sixty-five songs were recorded and considered for the album and five distinct concepts were rejected before the band hit upon the records final form. One late version, very nearly released, contained only a few of \"Bee Thousand\"'s definitive songs. The rest were left out and nearly ended up in the boxes of cassette out-takes cluttering up Robert Pollard's basement. The story of \"Guided By Voices\" transformation from an occasional and revolving group of complete unknowns to indie-rock heroes is very much part of the story behind the making of \"Bee Thousand.\"<br /><br />In addition to providing a central account of how the record was made, Woodworth devotes a substantial chapter to the album's lyrics. Robert Pollard's lyrics are described by critics, when they're described at all, as a brand of tossed-off surrealism, as if his verbal sensibility is somehow incidental to the songs themselves. Nothing could be further from the truth. Woodworth offers a sustained discussion of Pollard's work as a writer of often sublime, beautiful, and very human lyrics.<br /><br />The third key section of the book covers aesthetics. Woodworth considers the great appeal of the do-it-yourself nature of \"Bee Thousand\" and reflects on the larger importance of the strain of alternative rock for which this record is a touchstone.",

    "description": "In the first full-scale life of the most <br />important composer-lyricist at work in musical theatre today, Meryle Secrest, the biographer of Frank Lloyd Wright and Leonard Bernstein, draws on her extended conversations with Stephen Sondheim as well as on her interviews with his friends, family, collaborators, and lovers to bring us not only the artist--as a master of <br />modernist compositional style--but also the private man. <br />Beginning with his early childhood on New York's prosperous Upper West Side, Secrest describes how Sondheim was taught to play the piano by his father, a successful dress manufacturer and amateur musician. She writes about Sondheim's early ambition to become a concert pianist, about the effect on him of his parents' divorce when he was ten, about his years in military and private schools. She writes about his feelings of loneliness and abandonment, about the refuge he found in the home of Oscar and Dorothy Hammerstein, and his determination to become just like Oscar.<br />Secrest describes the years when Sondheim was struggling to gain a foothold in the theatre, his attempts at scriptwriting (in his early twenties in Rome on the <br />set of Beat the Devil with Bogart and Huston, and later in Hollywood as a co-writer with George Oppenheimer for the TV series Topper), living the Hollywood life.<br />Here is Sondheim's ascent to the peaks of the Broadway musical, from his chance meeting with play-<br />wright Arthur Laurents, which led to his first success--<br />as co-lyricist with Leonard Bernstein on West Side Story--to his collaboration with Laurents on Gypsy, to his first full Broadway score, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. And Secrest writes about his first big success as composer, lyricist, writer in the 1960s with Company, an innovative and sophisticated musical that examined marriage \u00e0 la mode. It was the start of an almost-twenty-year collaboration with producer and director Hal Prince that resulted in such shows as Follies, Pacific Overtures, Sweeney Todd, and <br />A Little Night Music.<br />We see Sondheim at work with composers, producers, directors, co-writers, actors, the greats of his time and ours, among them Leonard Bernstein, Ethel Merman, Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein, Jerome Robbins, Zero Mostel, Bernadette Peters, and Lee Remick (with whom it was said he was in love, and she with him), as Secrest vividly re-creates the energy, the passion, the despair, the excitement, the genius, that went into the making of show after Sondheim show.<br />A biography that is sure to become the standard work on Sondheim's life and art.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "Pierre Trudeau was prime minister of Canada from 1968 to 1979 and from 1980 to 1984. This is his story, told in his own words.<br /><br />Take a look through the book. When you do, you will find that this remarkable memoir has many qualities. It is:<br /><br />PERSONAL<br />As if he were sitting across the table from you, Pierre Trudeau reminisces about his life in an informal, direct way. He starts with his memories of his family, especially his mother and father, to whom the book is dedicated. There are memorable events from childhood here, such as a visit to complain to the principal on his second day at school. Later there is a lunchroom encounter with a high school bully and then, at the age of fifteen, real tragedy.<br /><br />\u201cAroused by the ringing of the telephone, I came out of my room to go downstairs and find out what was happening. But I froze on the landing when I heard the awful words: \u2018Your father is dead, Pierre.\u2019\u201d<br /><br />PHILOSOPHICAL<br />After an extensive education in Montreal, Boston, London, and Paris, Trudeau set off with a backpack to travel around the world. He tells how he went through one war zone after another, encountering armed bandits and being arrested in wartime Jordan as a Jewish spy. These adventures and further travels through India and war-torn China left with him a deep belief in the rights of the individual and the vital role of government in protecting these rights. He tells how his hatred of narrow nationalism reinforced his stand against requests for special treatment by successive Quebec governments.<br /><br />POLITICAL<br />From the day he decided to go to Ottawa as a Liberal MP in 1965, Trudeau was clearly on a fast track. After becoming minister of justice in 1967 and tackling very controversial law reforms, he ran for the leadership and became prime minister in 1968 \u2013 the first Canadian leader born in the twentieth century. He talks about his use of \u201cthe Liberal machine\u201d and all the electoral fights that followed over the year, providing interesting insights into his contests with national opponents such as Robert Stanfield, David Lewis, Joe Clark (a tougher opponent than the man who deposed him), Ed Broadbent, and Brian Mulroney, about whose virtues he is eloquently silent.<br /><br />PERSONALITY-FILLED<br />As a leader whose time in office ran from the fall of Charles de Gaulle to the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev, Pierre Trudeau was able to exert his influence to break down the Cold War mentality. He enjoyed good personal rapport with such different leaders as Chou Enlai, Jimmy Carter, Fidel Castro, Helmut Schmidt, and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand. His relations with Richard Nixon and Margaret Thatcher were less warm, and he was less impressed by Ronald Reagan\u2019s intellect than by the wisdom of the Queen.<br /><br />PATRIOTIC<br />Whether they loved him or hated him, Canadians knew that in Pierre Trudeau\u2019s time, the government stood up for Canada. He stood up to the domestic terrorism of the FLQ \u2013 and he makes no apologies here for his tough response to the October Crisis in 1970 \u2013 just as he stood up to the provincial premiers (including R\u00e9n\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque) who he believed were blocking the patriation of Canada\u2019s constitution ten years later.<br /><br />PERTINENT<br />The author\u2019s preface ends with a word to you, the reader. \u201cWhether you were a Liberal Cabinet colleague, a Canadian voter whose support we sought, or a young Canadian whose future we tried to improve, you are a part of this book.\u201d",

The girls have each spent the year struggling to fit into the world of the healthy. Now they're back, this time as \"big sisters\" to a new group of girls who also face life-threatening illnesses.<br />But even as the friends strive to help their \"little sisters\" face the future together, they must separately confront their own expectations. Katie must decide between an old flame and an exciting scholarship far from home. Chelsea must overcome her fear of romance. And Lacey must convince the boy that she loves that the feelings for him can be trusted.<br />When tragedy strikes Jenny House, each of the girls knows that things can never be the same again. Will Lacey, Chelsea, and Katie find a way to carry on the legacy of the Jenny House? Can their special friendship endure when they go their separate ways?",

The holy icon of Saint Barbara of the Thunder is bound for the city of Bahia for an exhibition of holy art.\u00a0\u00a0As the boat the bears the image is docking, a miracle occurs and Saint Barbara comes to life, disappearing into the milling crowd on the quay.\u00a0\u00a0Somewhere in the city a young woman has fallen in love, and her prudish guardian aunt has locked her away--an act of intolerance that Saint Barbara must redress.\u00a0\u00a0And when she casts her spell over the city, no one's life will remain unchanged.",

    "description": "<div><b>A completely revised and expanded edition of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling guide to putting things in order</b><br /><br /> Getting organized is a skill that anyone can learn, and there's no better teacher than America's organizing queen, Julie Morgenstern, as hundreds of thousands of readers have learned. Drawing on her years of experience as a professional organizer, Morgenstern outlines a simple organizing plan that starts with understanding your individual goals, natural habits, and psychological needs, so that you can work with your priorities and personality rather than against them. The basic steps-Analyze, Strategize, Attack-can be applied to any space or situation. <br /><br />In this thoroughly revised edition, Morgenstern has incorporated new information in response to feedback from her clients and audiences. These changes include<br />- new chapters on living or working with someone who is disorganized<br />- new chapters on organizing photographs, handbags, briefcases, and travel bags<br />- an expanded program for organizing your kitchen<br />- a new guide to getting started<br />- a fully updated resource guide<br /><br /></div>",

    "description": "Set in South Africa under white rule, Doris Lessing's first novel is both a riveting chronicle of human disintegration and a beautifully understated social critique. Mary Turner is a self-confident, independent young woman who becomes the depressed, frustrated wife of an ineffectual, unsuccessful farmer. Little by little the ennui of years on the farm work their slow poison, and Mary's despair progresses until the fateful arrival of an enigmatic and virile black servant, Moses. Locked in anguish, Mary and Moses - master and slave - are trapped in a web of mounting attraction and repulsion. Their psychic tension explodes in an electrifying scene that ends this disturbing tale of racial strife in colonial South Africa.<br /><br /><i>The Grass Is Singing</i> blends Lessing's imaginative vision with her own vividly remembered early childhood to recreate the quiet horror of a woman's struggle against a ruthless fate.<br /><br />Author Biography:<br />Doris Lessing was born to British parents in Persia in 1919 and moved with her family to Southern Rhodesia when she was five years old. She went to England in 1949 and has lived there ever since. She is the author of more than thirty books - novels, short stories, reportage, poems, and plays - and is considered among the most important writers of the postwar era. Her most recent works include two volumes of autobiography, <i>Under My Skin</i> and <i>Walking in the Shade,</i> and a novel, <i>Mara and Dann</i>.",

    "description": "Legend states that there exists a mighty sword that makes its possessor invincible to his enemies. But there is a curse on anyone who lifts the sword for conquest. King Kareed of Archeld goes after this sword anyway, winning it from the King of Bellandra. When he returns home from battle, he brings his daughter, Princess Torina, two special gifts. One is a unique crystal, in which she can view visions of the future. The other gift is the defeated king\u2019s son Landen, who is to be her slave. Torina immediately releases Landen, who becomes a member of the King\u2019s army and her close friend.<br /><br />But trouble is lurking in the kingdom of Archeld and people are accusing Landen of plotting against the King. Torina refuses to believe he would hurt her family. Then Torina begins seeing deadly visions in her crystal. Can she save her father\u2019s life and the future of her kingdom?",

    "description": "Der Landvermesser K. kommt in einem am Fu\u00dfe eines Schlosses gelegenen Dorf an, in dem die Bewohner in st\u00e4ndiger Angst vor den im Schloss herrschenden Machthabern bzw. Beh\u00f6rden leben. Sechs Tage lang begegnen K. die merkw\u00fcrdigsten Dinge, er versucht vergeblich, zum Schloss vorzudringen und k\u00e4mpft verzweifelt um Anerkennung. Eine d\u00fcstere, alptraumhaft anmutende Stimmung liegt \u00fcber dem Geschehen. 'Das Schlo\u00df' ist einer der r\u00e4tselhaftesten Romane des 20. Jahrhunderts, nicht nur K., sondern auch dem Leser wird stets aufs Neue der Boden unter den F\u00fc\u00dfen weggezogen. (Amazon)",

    "description": "Sun Tzu\u2019s <i>Art of War</i> is the most famous, and the most thought-provoking, work of strategy ever written. The profound insights of this book have endured for over two thousand years, and they continue to reward careful study. The <i>Military Methods</i> of Sun Pin, the great-grandson of Sun Tzu, is a brilliant elaboration on his ancestor\u2019s work, which has been lost for nearly two millennia. Presented here together for the first time are the greatest of the ancient Chinese classics of strategic thought: <i>The Complete Art of War.</i>The Sun family writings on strategy represent a unique contribution to our understanding of human affairs. By unveiling the complex, often unexpected, interrelationships of armies locked in battle, their wisdom reveals the enduring principles of success in the struggle of life itself.With a unique index to the essential principles of strategy, and Sawyer\u2019s thoughtful chapter-by-chapter commentaries, <i>The Complete Art of War</i> is designed to guide the reader to new insights into the nature of human conflict and a greater understanding of every field of human activity, from playing the game of politics to building a successful marriage, from closing a deal to managing a large organization, and even from making war to making peace.",

    "description": "The magic of <b>The Sound of Music</b> lives on in the minds and hearts of everyone it has touched. Now, <b>Charmian Carr</b>, who in 1965 captivated moviegoers as Liesl \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" von Trapp, tells what it was like to be a part of the film that has become a cultural phenomenon. It's all here: from how she got the role (and why she almost didn't) to romances on the set and wild nights in Salzburg; from the near-disaster during the gazebo dance to her relationships--then and now--with her six celluloid siblings. Charmian offers stories from fans and friends and a treasury of photographs. And she reveals why she left acting, what she learned when she met the real von Trapp children; and how The Sound of Music has helped her get through stormy times in her own life. <b>Forever Liesl</b> celebrates the spirit of the movie and what it stands for: family love, romance, inspiration, nostalgia, and the joy and power of music.",

    "description": "<em>The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge</em> is Rilke\u2019s major prose work and was one of the earliest publications to introduce him to American readers. The very wide audience which Rilke\u2019s work commands today will welcome the reissue in paperback of this extremely perceptive translation of the <em>Notebooks</em> by M. D. Herter Norton. A masterly translation of one of the first great modernist novels by one of the German language's greatest poets, in which a young man named Malte Laurids Brigge lives in a cheap room in Paris while his belongings rot in storage. Every person he sees seems to carry their death within them and with little but a library card to distinguish him from the city's untouchables, he thinks of the deaths, and ghosts, of his aristocratic family, of which he is the sole living descendant. Suffused with passages of lyrical brilliance, Rilke's semi-autobiographical novel is a moving and powerful coming-of-age story.",

    "description": "He was named \"Sham\" for the sun, this golden-red stallion born in the Sultan of Morocco's stone stables. Upon his heel was a small white spot, the symbol of speed. But on his chest was the symbol of misfortune. Although he was as swift as the desert winds, Sham's proud pedigree would be scorned all his life by cruel masters and owners. This is the classic story of Sham and his friend, the stable boy Agba. Their adventures take them from the sands of the Sahara to the royal courts of France, and finally to the green pastures and stately homes of England. For Sham was the renowned Godolphin Arabian, whose blood flows through the veins of almost every superior thoroughbred. Sham's speed -- like his story -- has become legendary.",

He had no match among enemies, or women ... until he met Lyonene, the green-eyed beauty whose fiery spirit matched his own. Through a whirlwind romance and stormy marriage, she endured every peril to be by his side... until jealousy and vicious lies drove her across the Irish Sea and into grave danger. One man could save her -- only the fierce Black Lyon had the courage to destroy the ruthless plot that had driven them apart and threatened the bond of love they had vowed could never be broken.</p>",

In 1946, Anatole Broyard was a dapper, earnest, fledgling avant-gardist, intoxicated by books, sex, and the neighborhood that offered both in such abundance. Stylish written, mercurially witty, imbued with insights that are both affectionate and astringent, this memoir offers an indelible portrait of a lost bohemia.",

There are hundreds of different kinds: from Vampires to Lykae, from Furies to Shifters, from the Fey to Valkyries.\n    \n    These immortals call their world The Lore.\n    \n    You may have had a brush with one of Lorekind already. The eccentric billionaire with hypnotic charisma\u2014and an aversion to sunlight. The ethereal waif of impossible beauty\u2014whose fingernails look more like claws. The Highlander with a seventeenth-century Scottish accent and animal magnetism\u2014who can never be penciled in on the night of the full moon.\n    \n    They walk among us, but they war among themselves. Each faction has its strengths, weaknesses, and age old prejudices against the others. Every five hundred years, the Accession, a battle for supremacy, rages. That time is now. . . .",

    "description": "In <em>Music for Torching,</em> the controversial author of <em>The End of Alice</em> lays bare the foundations of marriage and family life at the end of the century. Flash-frozen in the anxious culture of a suburban subdivision, Paul and Elaine (the couple first featured in Homes's collection of stories <em>The Safety of Objects)</em> have two boys and a beautiful home, yet they find themselves thoroughly inexplicably stuck. Obsessed with \"making things good again,\" they spin the quiet terrors of family life into fantastical frenzy that careens out of control, doing and saying all the things we dare not, throwing into full relief the chasm between our public and private selves. From a strange and hilarious encounter on the floor of the pantry with a Stepford-wife neighbor, to an ill-concieved plan for a tattoo, to a sexy town cop who shows up at every inopportuune moment, to house cleaning team in space suits, to a mistress calling on the cell phone, to a hostage situation at the school, Homes creates characters so outrageously flawed and deeply human that they are entirely believable. With <em>Music For Torching,</em> A.M. Homes brings her unnerving emotional intensity to the heart of America, creating a new and dangerous territory that is distinctly her own.",

From her vantage point behind the counter, she sees all the goings-on at the mall--and some things she sees are disturbing. Racism, dirty politics, and drugs are all part of the scene. Roberta doesn't like it, but she's just a fifteen-year-old--so what can she do?<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br />Roberta is surprised to find out just how much power she does have. To hone her journalistic skills, she begins to investigate hate crimes at the mall. In the process, she uncovers some shocking information concerning her own mother's death. And as she learns to stand up for herself and the truth, Roberta becomes the kind of person who makes things happen--a crusader.",

    "description": "The only English translation authorized by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn <br /><br />First published in the Soviet journal <i>Novy Mir</i> in 1962, <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i> stands as a classic of contemporary literature. The story of labor-camp inmate Ivan Denisovich Shukhov, it graphically describes his struggle to maintain his dignity in the face of communist oppression. An unforgettable portrait of the entire world of Stalin's forced work camps, <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i> is one of the most extraordinary literary documents to have emerged from the Soviet Union and confirms Solzhenitsyn's stature as \"a literary genius whose talent matches that of Dosotevsky, Turgenev, Tolstoy\"--Harrison Salisbury<br /><br />This unexpurgated 1991 translation by H. T. Willetts is the only authorized edition available and fully captures the power and beauty of the original Russian. <br />",

From Sione, who prefers to play cards with his secretary during work hours, to Ole Pasifikiwei, who masters the twists and turns of international funding games, all of the characters in these pages are seasoned surfers, capable of riding the biggest wave to shore. These are not stories of fatal impact so much as upbeat tales of indigenous responses to cultural and economic imperialism. Epeli Hauofa uses devices derived from oral storytelling to create a South Pacific voice that is lucid, hilarious, and compassionate in a work that has long been regarded as a milestone in Pacific literature.",

    "description": "Journey \"inside the numbers\" for an exceptional set of statistical tools and rules that can help explain the winning, or losing, ways of a basketball team. <i>Basketball on Paper</i> doesn\u2019t diagram plays or explain how players get in shape, but instead demonstrates how to interpret player and team performance. Dean Oliver highlights general strategies for teams when they\u2019re winning or losing and what aspects should be the focus in either situation. He describes and quantifies the jobs of team leaders and role players, then discusses the interactions between players and how to achieve the best fit. Oliver conceptualizes the meaning of teamwork and how to quantify the value of different types of players working together. He examines historically successful NBA teams and identifies what made them so successful: individual talent, a system of putting players together, or good coaching. Oliver then uses these statistical tools and case studies to evaluate the best players in history, such as Magic Johnson, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, and Charles Barkley and how they contributed to their teams\u2019 success. He does the same for some of the NBA\u2019s \"oddball\" players-Manute Bol, Muggsy Bogues, and Dennis Rodman and for the WNBA\u2019s top players. <i>Basketball on Paper</i> is unique in its incorporation of business and analytical concepts within the context of basketball to measure the value of players in a cooperative setting. Whether you\u2019re looking for strategies or new ideas to throw out while watching the ballgame at a sports bar, Dean Oliver\u2019s<i>Basketball on Paper</i> will give you amazing new insights into teamwork, coaching, and success.",

    "description": "Robert Gu is a recovering Alzheimer's patient. The world that he remembers was much as we know it today. Now, as he regains his faculties through a cure developed during the years of his near-fatal decline, he discovers that the world has changed and so has his place in it. He was a world-renowned poet. Now he is seventy-five years old, though by a medical miracle he looks much younger, and he\u2019s starting over, for the first time unsure of his poetic gifts. Living with his son\u2019s family, he has no choice but to learn how to cope with a new information age in which the virtual and the real are a seamless continuum, layers of reality built on digital views seen by a single person or millions, depending on your choice. But the consensus reality of the digital world is available only if, like his thirteen-year-old granddaughter Miri, you know how to wear your wireless access\u2014through nodes designed into smart clothes\u2014and to see the digital context\u2014through smart contact lenses. <br /><br />With knowledge comes risk. When Robert begins to re-train at Fairmont High, learning with other older people what is second nature to Miri and other teens at school, he unwittingly becomes part of a wide-ranging conspiracy to use technology as a tool for world domination. <br /><br />In a world where every computer chip has Homeland Security built-in, this conspiracy is something that baffles even the most sophisticated security analysts, including Robert\u2019s son and daughter-in law, two top people in the U.S. military. And even Miri, in her attempts to protect her grandfather, may be entangled in the plot. <br /><br />As Robert becomes more deeply involved in conspiracy, he is shocked to learn of a radical change planned for the UCSD Geisel Library; all the books there, and worldwide, would cease to physically exist. He and his fellow re-trainees feel compelled to join protests against the change. With forces around the world converging on San Diego, both the conspiracy and the protest climax in a spectacular moment as unique and satisfying as it is unexpected.",

    "description": "Nick Bantock's illustrated novel, <i>The Venetian's Wife</i>, is part love story, part mystery, and part ghostly tale\u2014and an altogether bewitching brew of sensuality and lost treasures. Thoroughly bored with her job at the local museum, Sarah heads to the gallery to take another look at that new drawing, the one she can't stop thinking about, the one of the Hindu god Shiva, who dances...That's when it all begins. The next day, an e-mail message brings her a job offer: to find the few remaining pieces of a 15th-century adventurer's renowned collection of Indian sculptures. Her employer, curiously, wishes to communicate only by computer. She has no idea who he is or why he wants her. But other mysteries soon preoccupy her, such as the meaning of an enigmatic illuminated manuscript\u2014and the sensual transformation that seems to be overtaking her. Through her quirkily decorated diary and the artful e-mail exchanges between Sara and her mentor, Nick Bantock has conjured up a richly illustrated tale of a relentless quest, an amorous legacy, and the resonating power of art\u2014a lush, romantic adventure of the soul that tantalizes the reader to the last line.",

    "description": "Written during a critical period of his life, <b>Some of the Dharma</b> is a key volume for understanding Kerouac and the spiritual underpinnings of his work.While his future masterpiece, <b>On the Road</b>, languished on the desks of unresponsive editors, Kerouac turned to Buddhist practice, and in 1953 began compiling reading notes on the subject intended for his friend <b>Allen Ginsberg</b>. As Kerouac's Buddhist meditation practice intensified, what had begun as notes evolved into a vast and all-encompassing work of nonfiction into which he poured his life, incorporating poems, haiku, prayers, journal entries, meditations, fragments of letters, ideas about writing, overheard conversations, sketches, blues, and more. The final manuscript, completed in 1956, was as visually complex as the writing: each page was unique, typed in patterns and interlocking shapes. The elaborate form that Kerouac so painstakingly gave the book on his manual typewriter is re-created in this typeset facsimile. Passionate and playful, filled with humor, insight, sorrow, and struggle, <b>Some of the Dharma</b> is one of Kerouac's most profound and original works.",

    "description": "Two brothers leave their London home to hunt down the man who murdered their sister in this accomplished thriller by the acclaimed author of CANDY and KISSING THE RAIN.<br /><br />On a storm-ravaged night, a 19-year-old girl is kidnapped, raped, and killed. Three days later, her two younger brothers set out in search of her murderer. Cole, 17, is a dark-eyed devil who doesn't care if he lives or dies, while Ruben, 14, is a strange child who sometimes, inexplicably, experiences sensations above and beyond his own. This is the story of the boys' journey from their half-gypsy home on a London junk lot to the ghostly moors of Devon, where they hope and fear to find the truth about their sister's death. It's a long road, cold and hard and violent. It's THE ROAD OF THE DEAD.",

    "description": "Set in English society before the 1832 Reform Bill, <i>Wives and Daughters</i> centres on the story of youthful Molly Gibson, brought up from childhood by her father. When he remarries, a new step-sister enters Molly's quiet life \u2013 loveable, but worldly and troubling, Cynthia. The narrative traces the development of the two girls into womanhood within the gossiping and watchful society of Hollingford.<br /><br /><i>Wives and Daughters</i> is far more than a nostalgic evocation of village life; it offers an ironic critique of mid-Victorian society. 'No nineteenth-century novel contains a more devastating rejection than this of the Victorian male assumption of moral authority', writes Pam Morris in her introduction to this new edition, in which she explores the novel's main themes \u2013 the role of women, Darwinism and the concept of Englishness \u2013 and its literary and social context.",

He's living (for now) with his spaced-out mother and little brother in a homeless shelter. His father's in jail. His girlfriend supports him, but he doesn't feel good enough for her - and seems to be always on the verge of doing the wrong thing around her. There's another girl at the homeless shelter who is also after him, although the desires there are complicated. Tyrell feels he needs to score some money to make things better. Will he end up following in his father's footsteps?",

Like the long slow sigh of a cello: dying. But the sound of it is the only beautiful thing about it. <br /><br />As life slips away, Gabriel looks back over his brief twenty years, which have been clouded by frustration and humiliation. A small, unforgiving town and distant, punitive parents ensure that he is never allowed to forget the horrific mistake he made as a child. He has only two friends - his dog, Surrender, and the unruly wild boy, Finnigan, a shadowy doppelganger with whom the meek Gabriel once made a boyhood pact. But when a series of arson attacks grips the town, Gabriel realizes how unpredictable and dangerous Finnigan is. As events begin to spiral violently out of control, it becomes devastatingly clear that only the most extreme measures will rid Gabriel of Finnigan for good.",

    "description": "The Velvet Underground and Nico has influenced the sound of more bands than any other album. And remarkably, it still sounds as fresh and challenging today as it did upon its release in 1967. In this book, Joe Harvard covers everything from Lou Reed's lyrical genius to John Cale's groundbreaking instrumentation, and from the creative input of Andy Warhol to the fine details of the recording process. With input from co-producer Norman Dolph and Velvets fan Jonathan Richman, Harvard documents the creation of a record which - in the eyes of many - has never been matched.<br /><br />EXCERPT<br />In 1966, some studios, like Abbey Road, had technicians in white lab coats, and even the less formal studios usually had actual engineering graduates behind the consoles. Studios were still more about science than art. Clients who dared make technical suggestions were treated with bemusement, derision, or hostility. The Velvets were a young band under constant critical attack, and the pressure to conform in order to gain acceptance must have been tremendous. Most bands of that era compromised with their record companies, through wholesale revamping of their image from wardrobe to musical style, changing or omitting lyrics, creating drastically edited versions for radio airplay, or eliminating songs entirely from their sets and records. With Andy Warhol in the band's corner, such threats were minimized.",

That evening, after dark, they would all be gathering round a blazing fire for the traditional midwinter celebrations. A grand entertainment was planned, and Primrose and Wilfred had chosen to recite a poem. They went up to the attics to rehearse in peace and quiet, but there were so many things to look at and places to explore, it was hard to concentrate.

    "description": "Around 60,000 years ago, a man\u2014genetically identical to us\u2014lived in Africa. Every person alive today is descended from him. How did this real-life Adam wind up as the father of us all? What happened to the descendants of other men who lived at the same time? And why, if modern humans share a single prehistoric ancestor, do we come in so many sizes, shapes, and races?<br /><br />Examining the hidden secrets of human evolution in our genetic code, Spencer Wells reveals how developments in the revolutionary science of population genetics have made it possible to create a family tree for the whole of humanity. Replete with marvelous anecdotes and remarkable information, from the truth about the real Adam and Eve to the way differing racial types emerged, <b>The Journey of Man</b> is an enthralling, epic tour through the history and development of early humankind.",

It is September 18, 1982, and for the next nine days Orr will live under the spell of this blank book, trapped inside a world of eerie premonitions and bewildering events that threaten to destroy his marriage and undermine his faith in reality. <br />\tA novel that expands to fill volumes in the reader's mind, <i>Oracle Night</i> is a beautifully constructed meditation on time, love, storytelling and the imagination by one of America's boldest and most original writers.",

    "description": "<b>Now the subject of a new film directed by Pablo Larrain, \"Jackie,\" starring Natalie Portman</b><br /><br />Acclaimed biographer Sarah Bradford explores the life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the woman who has captivated the public for more than five decades, in a definitive portrait that is both sympathetic and frank. With an extraordinary range of candid interviews--many with people who have never spoken in such depth on record before--Bradford offers new insights into the woman behind the public persona. She creates a coherent picture out of Jackie's tumultuous and cosmopolitan life--from the aristocratic milieu of Newport and East Hampton to the Greek isles, from political Washington to New York's publishing community. She probes Jackie's privileged upbringing, her highly public marriages, and her roles as mother and respected editor, and includes rare photos from private collections to create the most complete account yet written of this legendary life. <br />Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's life is once again the center of interest with the 2016 release of the Pablo Larrain movie \"Jackie,\" starring Natalie Portman.",

When she's barefoot and running, she can hear her heart beating . . . thump-THUMP, thump-THUMP. It's a rhythm that makes sense in a year when everything's shifting: Her mother is pregnant, her grandfather is forgetful, and her best friend, Max, is always moody. Everything changes over time, just like the apple Annie's been assigned to draw. But as she watches and listens, Annie begins to understand the many rhythms of life, and how she fits within them.<br /><br />Twelve-year-old Annie ponders the many rhythms of life the year that her mother becomes pregnant, her grandfather begins faltering, and her best friend (and running partner) becomes distant.",

Here he was presented with a prophecy 'So long as a daughter of Thelatimos's line defends and rules, Skala shall never be subjugated.' And that is how the line of queens ruling over Skala was established... However, as generations went by the male heirs to the throne became intensely resentful of the prophecy that emasculated their claim to power. Finally Queen Agnalain took the throne and the people of Skala suffered under her erratic and selfish command. Prompted by the people's outcry over this mad queen, her son Prince Erius claimed primogeniture, and seized the throne. Erius's ascent may have pleased the people of Skala, but a faction of the population, one who had not forgotten the prophecy, were worried. Plague, drought and famine spread throughout the kingdom weakening it's defences and offering easy pickings to Skala's old enemy and neighbour, Plenimar. As people start to recall the Oracle's prophecy, Erius begins to quietly kill of his female rel",

Steven Mithen brings this world to life through the eyes of an imaginary modern traveler--John Lubbock, namesake of the great Victorian polymath and author of <i>Prehistoric Times</i>. With Lubbock, readers visit and observe communities and landscapes, experiencing prehistoric life--from aboriginal hunting parties in Tasmania, to the corralling of wild sheep in the central Sahara, to the efforts of the Guila Naquitz people in Oaxaca to combat drought with agricultural innovations.<br /><br />Part history, part science, part time travel, <i>After the Ice</i> offers an evocative and uniquely compelling portrayal of diverse cultures, lives, and landscapes that laid the foundations of the modern world.",

Acclaimed around the world, <i>The Secret River</i> is a magnificent, transporting work of historical fiction.<br />",

The novel follows Bol\u00edvar as he takes his final journey in 1830 down the Magdalena River toward the sea, revisiting the scenes of his former glory and lamenting his lost dream of an alliance of American nations. Forced from power, dogged by assassins, and prematurely aged and wasted by a fatal illness, the General is still a remarkably vital and mercurial man. He seems to remain alive by the sheer force of will that led him to so many victories in the battlefields and love affairs of his past. As he wanders in the labyrinth of his failing powers-and still-powerful memories-he defies his impending death until the last.<br /><br /><i>The General in His Labyrinth </i>is an unforgettable portrait of a visionary from one of the greatest writers of our time.",

    "description": "Shimmering with suspense and emotional intensity - takes readers on a hunt for the truth about a man and his memories, and about both the heartbreaking fragility and enormous strength of love.<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks is our very best chronicler of the human heart. His stunning first novel, The Notebook, has been given by friend to friend and lover to lover all over the world as a testament to the timeless power of love. But if we thought he could never again move us so deeply, he now shows us he can-in a story that renews our faith in destiny...in the ability of true lovers to find each other no matter where, no matter when... Message In A Bottle <br /><br />Thrown to the waves, and to fate, the bottle could have ended up anywhere. Instead, it is found just three weeks after it begins its journey. Theresa Osborne, divorced and the mother of a twelve-year-old son, picks it up during a seaside vacation from her job as a Boston newspaper columnist. Inside is a letter that opens with: <br /><br />My Dearest Catherine, I miss you my darling, as I always do, but today is particularly hard because the ocean has been singing to me, and the song is that of our life together... <br /><br />For \"Garrett,\" the man who signs the letter, the message is the only way he knows to express his undying love for a woman he has lost. For Theresa, wary of romance since her husband shattered her trust, the message raises questions that intrigue her. Who are Garrett and Catherine? Where is he now? What is his story? <br /><br />Challenged by the mystery, and pulled to find Garrett by emotions she does not fully understand, Theresa begins a search that takes her to a sunlit coastal town and an unexpected confrontation. Brought together by chance-or something more powerful-Theresa and Garrett are people whose lives are about to touch for a purpose, in a tale that resonates with our deepest hopes for finding that special someone and everlasting love. <br /><br />Shimmering with suspense and emotional intensity, Message in a Bottle takes readers on a hunt for the truth about a man and his memories, and about both the heartbreaking fragility and enormous strength of love. For those who cherished The Notebook and readers waiting to discover the magic of Nicholas Sparks's storytelling, here is his new, achingly lovely novel of happenstance, desire, and the choices that matter most...",

When the banana company leaves town as fast as it arrived, all they are left with is a void of decay. <br /><br />Living in this devastated and soulless wasteland is one last honourable man, the Colonel, who is determined to fulfil a long standing promise, no matter how unpalatable it may be. With the death of the detested Doctor, he must provide an honourable burial - and incur the wrath of the rest of Macondo, who would rather see the Doctor rot, forgotten and unattended.<br /><br />Also contains the stories: The Handsomest Drowned Man in the World, A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings, Blacaman the Good, Vendor of Miracles, The Last Voyage of the Ghost Ship, Monologue of Isabel Watching It Rain in Macondo, Nabo",

    "description": "In a seedy river town on the Gulf of Honduras, Jack Rathbone believed he had found a place that would give him and his lover, the accomplished artist Vera Savage, the solitude they would need to create a body of work that would shake the art world to its core. But in a place where time lies thicker than the mangrove swamps that surround it, Jack and Vera discover an emotional frontier more fearsome, untamed, and dangerous than any wilderness. Told through the voice of Jack's adoring sister, Gin, <i>Port Mungo</i> is the riveting story of this ill-fated couple, one that begins as a bohemian flight-of-fancy before unraveling into a dark, debauched and sinister tale. With <i>Port Mungo</i>, the incomparable Patrick McGrath, author of the acclaimed novels <i>Spider</i> and <i>Asylum</i>, delivers a spellbinding narrative to explore the obsessive pursuit of art and love.",

    "description": "Though one of the giants of 20th-century American letters he's often been marginalized, relegated to the ghetto of writers about race. This perception of Baldwin solely as a black writer--and thus one whose interest lies primarily in the sociological or the documentary--undercuts the real importance he's had in the development of postwar literature. The Library of America celebrates his place at the heart of American culture with two volumes of his most influential work, both edited by Toni Morrison.<br /><br />The first of these collects Baldwin's early fiction, including the novels <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i>, <i>Giovanni's Room</i>, &amp; <i>Another Country</i>, &amp; the short story collection <i>Going to Meet the Man</i>. The second brings together most of his published essays, including those found in such volumes as <i>Notes of a Native Son</i> &amp; <i>The Fire Next Time</i>, as well as many collected here for the first time.<br /><br />Baldwin was born in Harlem in 1924, the stepson of a Baptist preacher. He experienced conversion at age 14 &amp; spent the next 3 years as a Pentecostal minister. By 17, however, he'd been introduced to the Greenwich Village art &amp; music scenes. He left the church at the end of his senior high school year &amp; began his life as an artist.<br /><br />Baldwin is most remembered for his writings on race, which began with a number of reviews of books on \"the Negro problem, concerning which the color of my skin made me automatically an expert.\" Throughout his career, however, he concerned himself less with the black experience per se than with the entire milieu of beliefs &amp; prejudices that foster the painful relations experienced between the races.<br /><br />But even from his first novel, Baldwin complicated this view of race relations with the equally thorny problems of sexual relations. By age 18 he thought himself a homosexual. The first, inarticulate leanings of a young boy toward members of his own sex can be seen in <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i>, published in 1953. Inspired by his own experience, this novel portrays a young boy growing up in Harlem who buries his conflict with his parents--&amp; the inner conflict surrounding his feelings about a young preacher at church--by experiencing his conversion, finding himself saved from his sins, both actual &amp; potential.<br /><br /><i>Giovanni's Room</i>, published in 1956, takes up these latent issues of sexuality &amp; masculinity &amp; makes them the central area of exploration. David, the narrator, attempts throughout to account for a sexuality he perceives as aberrant, while telling the story of the young man, Giovanni, whose life has been destroyed by David's inability to deal honestly with him. It's interesting to note that in this first real exploration of the issues of sexuality, Baldwin used white characters--as though he were equipped, at this early point in his career, to confront issues of either racial or sexual prejudice, but not both.<br /><br />By the time of <i>Another Country</i>, however, he's brought these two fields of inquiry together. This third novel, published in 1962, is perhaps his most complex evocation of an entire social milieu, fraught with conflicts over the battle lines of race &amp; sex. In it, Rufus Scott, a promising young black jazz musician, is driven to suicide after a disastrous affair with a young white woman brings all of his uncontrollable anger about the division between black and white into his daily life. The fallout from his death, as it affects each person whose life he touched, creates a hostile, unstable world in which all such conflicts are dragged to the surface.<br /><br />Baldwin was also a prolific essayist and playwright. He spent much of his life shuttling between Paris and NYC, as well as shuttling between genres. His essays demonstrate his deep involvement in both the literary and the political worlds, confronting the same set of interwoven conflicts as his novels, but in the turbulent social setting of postwar America.<br /><br />Published in 1963, <i>The Fire Next Time</i> may be his most influential work, a penetrating analysis of the racial divide in the USA that serves as both a message of hope and a warning: \"If we--and now I mean the relatively conscious whites &amp; the relatively conscious blacks, who must, like lovers, insist on, or create the consciousness of others--do not falter in our duty now, we may be able, handful that we are, to end the racial nightmare, and achieve our country, and change the history of the world. If we do not now dare everything, the fulfillment of that prophecy, recreated from the Bible in song by a slave, is upon us: God gave Noah the rainbow sign, No more water, the fire next time!\"<br /><br />Baldwin died in 1987 of esophageal cancer. While he was alive, he spoke loud and long about the many battle lines that divide our country. These Library of America editions are the ideal format for that voice, which deserves to be preserved, treasured--and most of all, read.--\ufffdKathleen Fitzpatrick (edited)",

Cicade de Deus, the City of God, is one of Rio's most notorious slums. Yet it is also a place where samba rocks till dawn, where the women are the most beautiful on earth, and where one young man wants to escape his background and become a photographer. <i>City of God</i> is a sprawling, magnificently told epic about gang life in Rio's <i>favelas</i>, based on years of research and Pualo Lins's firsthand experience growing up in Cicade de Deus. A book that gives voice to the dispossessed of multiethnic Brazil, <i>City of God</i> will earn Paulo Lins more well-deserved international acclaim.</p>",

    "description": "This special reprint, featuring the acclaimed translation by Michael Wilson, is being made available again in response to public demand.Are we free, whether we know if or not? Or is our sense of freedom merely an illusion? Rudolf Steiner tackles this age-old problem in a new way. He shows that by taking account of our own activity of thinking, we can know the reasons for our actions. And if these reasons are taken from our world of ideals, then our actions are free, because we alone determine them. But this freedom cannot be settled for us by philosophical argument. It is not simply granted to us. If we want to become free, we have to strive through our own inner activity to overcome our unconscious urges and habits of thought. In order to do this we must reach a point of view that recognizes no limits to knowledge, sees through all illusions, and opens the door to an experience of the reality of the spiritual world. then we an achieve the highest level of evolution.",

He is used to the way of horses, too; but nothing has prepared him for the special connection he will forge with Gabilan, the hot-tempered pony his father gives him. With Billy Buck, the hired hand, Jody tends and trains his horse, restlessly anticipating the moment he will sit high upon Gabilan's saddle. But when Gabilan falls ill, Jody discovers there are still lessons he must learn about the ways of nature and, particularly, the ways of man.",

But in Snyder\u2019s wondrous imagination there\u2019s a thin membrane between the whimsical and the disturbing: the unlikely affair between a famous actress\u2014in hiding after surgery\u2014and a sporting goods salesman takes an ominous turn just as she begins to heal; an engaged couple\u2019s relationship is fractured when one of them becomes obsessed with an inmate at the women\u2019s prison next door. <br /><br />Dark, funny, powerful, this debut collection underscores the remarkable gifts of a fiercely original young writer.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

He convincingly conveys the unique appeal and gifts of each of the traditions and reveals their hold on the human heart and imagination.",

At the center of the novel is the protagonist Stephen Dedalus whose life is depicted from its various stages starting in childhood and moving through early adulthood. The language of the novel changes throughout the book to correspond with the artistic development of Stephen Dedalus as he ages and matures. \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" is a masterful depiction of the process of self-discovery that is indicative of the early stages of everyone's life.",

Can you deal with a<b> Naugatuck</b>(3) without causing a <b>Toronto</b>(4)? Will you suffer from<b> Kettering</b>(5) this summer? <br /><br />Probably. You are almost certainly familiar with all these experiences but just didn\u2019t know that there are words for them. Well, in fact, there aren\u2019t\u2014or rather there weren\u2019t, until Douglas Adams and John Lloyd decided to plug these egregious linguistic <b>lacunae</b>(6). They quickly realized that just as there are an awful lot of experiences that no one has a name for, so there are an awful lot of names for places you will never need to go to. What a waste. As responsible citizens of a small and crowded world, we must all learn the virtues of recycling(7) and put old, worn-out but still serviceable names to exciting, vibrant, new uses. This is the book that does that for you: <i>The Deeper Meaning of Liff</i>\u2014a whole new solution to the problem of <b>Great Wakering</b>(8)<br /><br /><br />1\u2014The feeling of aluminum foil against your fillings.<br /><br />2\u2014The way people stand when examining other people\u2019s bookshelves.<br /><br />3\u2014A plastic packet containing shampoo, mustard, etc., which is impossible to open except by biting off <br />the corners.<br /><br />4\u2014Generic term for anything that comes out in a gush, despite all your efforts to let it out carefully, e.g., flour into a white sauce, ketchup onto fish, a dog into the yard, and another naughty meaning that we can\u2019t put on the cover.<br /><br />5\u2014The marks left on your bottom and thighs after you\u2019ve been sitting sunbathing in a wicker chair.<br /><br />6\u2014God knows what this means<br /><br />7\u2014For instance, some of this book was first published in Britain twenty-six years ago.<br /><br />8\u2014Look it up yourself.",
