On TV the guy always gets the girl. <br /><br />As Carlos watched, he recalled Sal, the supposedly gay guy at school. It was then that the idea first popped into his brain: If Sal truly were queer...could he possibly help Carlos?...Not to propose to Roxy, of course -- at least not yet -- but to get her to maybe like him?",

    "description": "Learning to count has never been more fun than in this crazy tale of a dog, a lion and a tiger all showing off how many apples they can balance on their heads as they skip, walk the tightrope and roller skate their way through the book.<br /><br /><br />This delightful book forms part of the second stage in HarperCollins\u2019 major Dr. Seuss rebrand programme. With the relaunch of 10 more titles in August 2003, such all-time favourites as How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, Mr. Brown Can Moo! Can You? and Dr. Seuss\u2019 Sleep Book boast bright new covers that incorporate much needed guidance on reading levels: Blue Back Books are for parents to share with young children, Green Back Books are for budding readers to tackle on their own, and Yellow Back Books are for older, more fluent readers to enjoy. Ten Apples Up On Top belongs to the Green Back Book range.",

And if Daisy can't snare an appropriate suitor, she will marry the man he chooses\u2014the ruthless and aloof Matthew Swift.<br /><br />Daisy is horrified. A Bowman never admits defeat, and she decides to do whatever it takes to marry someone... anyone... other than Matthew. But she doesn't count on Matthew's unexpected charm... or the blazing sensuality that soon flares beyond both their control. And Daisy discovers that the man she has always hated just might turn out to be the man of her dreams.<br /><br />But right at the moment of sweet surrender, a scandalous secret is uncovered... one that could destroy both Matthew and a love more passionate and irresistible than Daisy's wildest fantasies.<br /><br /><i>Librarian's Note: Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28514524\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</i>",

Unfortunately her most persistent admirer is the brash Simon Hunt, a handsome and ambitious entrepreneur who wants her as his mistress.<br /><br />Annabelle is determined to resist Simon's wicked propositions, but she can't deny her attraction to the boldly seductive rogue, any more than he can resist the challenge she presents. As they try to outmaneuver each other, they find themselves surrendering to a love more powerful than they could have ever imagined. But fate may have other plans\u2014and it will take all of Annabelle's courage to face a peril that could destroy everything she holds dear.",

    "description": "Is it possible to die a happy death? This is the central question of Camus's astonishing early novel, published posthumously and greeted as a major literary event. It tells the story of a young Algerian, Mersault, who defies society's rules by committing a murder and escaping punishment, then experimenting with different ways of life and finally dying a happy man. In many ways <i>A Happy Death</i> is a fascinating first sketch for <i>The Outsider</i>, but it can also be seen as a candid self-portrait, drawing on Camus's memories of his youth, travels, and early relationships. It is infused with lyrical descriptions of the sun-drenched Algiers of his childhood - the place where, eventually, Mersault is able to find peace and die 'without anger, without hatred, without regret'.",

Has the third \"Wallflower\" now met her match?</i><br /><br /><b>A Devil's Bargain</b><br /><br />Easily the shyest Wallflower, Evangeline Jenner stands to become the wealthiest, once her inheritance comes due. Because she must first escape the clutches of her unscrupulous relatives, Evie has approached the rake Viscount St. Vincent with a most outrageous proposition: <i>marriage!</i><br /><br />Sebastian's reputation is so dangerous that thirty seconds alone with him will ruin any maiden's good name. Still, this bewitching chit appeared, <i>unchaperoned</i>, on his doorstep to offer her hand. Certainly an aristocrat with a fine eye for beauty could do far worse.<br /><br />But Evie's proposal comes with a condition: no lovemaking after their wedding night. She will <i>never</i> become just another of the dashing libertine's callously discarded broken hearts\u2014which means Sebastian will simply have to work harder at his seductions... or perhaps surrender his own heart for the very first time in the name of true love.<br /><br /><i>Librarian's Note: Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30656751\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</i>",

    "description": "Jeanne Marie Laskas had a dream of fleeing her otherwise happy urban life for fresh air and open space \u2014 a dream she would discover was about something more than that. But she never expected her fantasy to come true \u2014 until a summer afternoon\u2019s drive in the country.<br /><br />That\u2019s when she and her boyfriend, Alex \u2014 owner of Marley the poodle \u2014 stumble upon the place she thought existed only in her dreams. This pretty-as-a-picture-postcard farm with an Amish barn, a chestnut grove, and breathtaking vistas is real ... and for sale. And it\u2019s where she knows her future begins.<br /><br />But buying a postcard \u2014 fifty acres of scenery \u2014 and living on it are two entirely different matters. With wit and wisdom, Laskas chronicles the heartwarming and heartbreaking stories of the colorful two- and four-legged creatures she encounters on Sweetwater Farm.<br /><br />Against a backdrop of brambles, a satellite dish, and sheep, she tells a tender, touching, and hilarious tale about life, love, and the unexpected complications of having your dream come true.",

    "description": "In <b>Fifty Acres and a Poodle</b>, Jeanne Marie Laskas described how she survived her first hilariously tumultuous year at Sweetwater Farm. Now she returns with a funny, touching, and personal new memoir of what happens after your dream comes true...<br /><br />With a picture-postcard farm, a wonderful marriage, two mules, and a new refrigerator that spits crushed ice, what more can a girl ask for? That\u2019s precisely the question Jeanne Marie asks herself as she and Alex settle into their new life at Sweetwater Farm. Two years ago they left the city behind for a life filled with the practical, often comical, lessons of living close to the land\u2014and they never looked back. Yet when her strong-willed mom is hospitalized with a sudden and mysterious paralysis, Jeanne Marie rushes home to Philadelphia and her extended, sometimes chaotic, but always loving family. It\u2019s there that she realizes what is still missing from her life: a family of her own. Now it\u2019s a matter of bringing up the subject to her husband, Alex, fifteen years older and with adult children of his own, who seems terrified that she\u2019s thinking of adopting a Chihuahua.<br /><br />With warmth, wisdom, and unfailing humor, Laskas tells the poignant story of her search for motherhood\u2014and what happens when a woman risks happily-ever-after for something even more precious. As she tends to her own ailing mother, Jeanne Marie discovers that the challenges and rewards of living with Mother Nature pale in comparison to those awakened by the nature of mothering.<br /><br /><b>The Exact Same Moon</b> is filled with hilarious and heartwarming vignettes of people and a way of life you\u2019ll be glad you met. From \"borrowing\" sheep to help mow the lawn and sitting in on the racy hay jokes at the Agway Equine Clinic, to befriending the notorious old lady who holds the water rights to their future pond, corrupting the neighbors with satellite TV, and learning the fine art of going a-calling, Laskas proves once again that laughter, love, and wisdom are truly homegrown.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

Included are selections from works parodied by Cervantes (Amadis of Gaul and Orlando Furioso) and a portion of the spurious sequel to Part 1 written by Fernandes de Avellaneda. \"Criticisms\" presents fifteen major interpretations of both the novel and selected episodes, describing Cervantes intellectual milieu, revealing how he infused new life into the literary modes and motifs he had inherited, and illustrating the fundamental importance of Don Quijote in the history of modern fiction.",

    "description": "<div>Previously published as <i>Invisible Republic</i> and already considered a classic of modern American cultural criticism<i>,</i> <i>The Old, Weird America</i> is Greil Marcus's widely acclaimed book on the secret music (the so-called \"Basement Tapes\") made by Bob Dylan and the Band while in seclusion in Woodstock, New York, in 1967--a folksy yet funky, furious yet hilarious music that remains as seductive and baffling today as it was more than thirty years ago.<br /><br />As Mark Sinker observed in <i>The Wire</i>: \"Marcus's contention is that there can be found in American folk a community as deep, as electric, as perverse, and as conflicted as all America, and that the songs Dylan recorded out of the public eye, in a basement in Woodstock, are where that community as a whole gets to speak.\" But the country mapped out in this book, as Bruce Shapiro wrote in <i>The Nation</i>, \"is not Woody Guthrie's land for made for you and me . . . It's what Marcus calls 'the old, weird America.'\" This odd terrain, this strange yet familiar backdrop to our common cultural history--which Luc Sante (in <i>New York</i> magazine) termed the \"playground of God, Satan, tricksters, Puritans, confidence men, illuminati, braggarts, preachers, anonymous poets of all stripes\"--is the territory that Marcus has discovered in Dylan's most mysterious music. And his analysis of that territory \"reads like a thriller\" (Ken Tucker, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>) and exhibits \"a mad, sparkling brilliance\" (David Remnick, <i>The New Yorker</i>) throughout. This new edition of <i>The Old, Weird America</i> includes an updated discography.<br /></div>",

He forms relationships with his inanimate surroundings and muses to a dead audience, specifically his bear rug Phillippe. His own tales eventually become entangled with that of the legendary Paul Bunyan, and the two become indirectly intertwined, illuminating the discrepancy between the character of the storyteller and the character within his stories. The lives of both Paul and Pete encounter such things as the questionable origin of an ocean and the desire for preservation of everything from a fallen bird to an overused expression that has strayed a stone's throw from its original meaning.",

    "description": "This first volume, covering the first two and a quarter years of the strip, will be of particular fascination to <em>Peanuts</em> aficionados worldwide: Although there have been literally hundreds of <em>Peanuts</em> books published, many of the strips from the series' first two or three years have never been collected before\u2014in large part because they showed a young Schulz working out the kinks in his new strip and include some characterizations and designs that are quite different from the cast we're all familiar with. (Among other things, three major cast members\u2014Schroeder, Lucy, and Linus\u2014initially show up as infants and only \"grow\" into their final \"mature\" selves as the months go by. Even Snoopy debuts as a puppy!) Thus <em>The Complete Peanuts</em> offers a unique chance to see a master of the art form refine his skills and solidify his universe, day by day, week by week, month by month.<br /><br /><br />This volume is rounded out with Garrison Keillor's introduction, a biographical essay by David Michaelis (<em>Schulz and Peanuts</em>) and an in-depth interview with Schulz conducted in 1987 by Gary Groth and Rick Marschall, all wrapped in a gorgeous design by award-winning cartoonist Seth.",

    "description": "From the Booker Prize-winning author of <i>The Remains of the Day</i> and <i>When We Were Orphans</i>, comes an unforgettable edge-of-your-seat mystery that is at once heartbreakingly tender and morally courageous about what it means to be human.<br /><br />Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school, far from the influences of the city. Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it.<br /><br />Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it\u2019s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.<br /><br /><i>Never Let Me Go</i> breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date.",

    "description": "\"In action, a writer looks pretty much like a clerk.\" So Joe Haldeman writes in the introduction to this collection. But Haldeman, like Einstein, proves that clerks can have enough vision to rock the cosmos. This book includes 11 stories and four story poems, ranging in length from two pages to just over 100. Together they have earned two Nebula, two Hugo and one World Fantasy awards. Each one showcases the author's grasp of what it means to be alive and human (or inhuman), written with a powerful clarity and a subtle imagination. <i>Publishers Weekly</i> called this one \"a stunner.\"<br /><br />Contents:<br />Feedback (1993)<br />Passages (1990)<br />Job Security (1992)<br />The Hemingway Hoax (1990)<br />Images (1991)<br />Beachhead (1991)<br />The Monster (1986)<br />If I Had the Wings of an Angel (1991)<br />The Cure (1994)<br />Graves (1992)<br />None So Blind (1994)<br />The Homecoming (1990) poem<br />Fire, Ice (1994) poem<br />Time Lapse (1989) poem<br />DX (1987) poem",

    "description": "When Redwall was published in 1987 it catapulted author Brian Jacques to international stardom. And small wonder! This enthralling tale is jam-packed with the things we long for in a great adventure: danger, laughter, escapes, tragedy, mystery, a touch of wonder, a truly despicable villain, and a hero we can take to heart.<br /><br />That hero is Matthias, a young mouse who must rise above his fears and failures to save his friends at Redwall Abbey. The villain is Cluny the Scourage, one of the most deliciously despicable rats of all time. The unforgettable cast of supporting characters includes the stalwart badger Constance, an irrepressible hare named Basil Stag Hare, and the elderly wisemouse Brother Methuselah.<br /><br />But most of all there is Matthias, seeking his true destiny in a journey that will lead through danger and despair to true wisdom.",

    "description": "It can take a long time to build up a life, and only moments to destroy it. Gary and Molly met in the way couples do: after a long haul of being single, quickly becoming soulmates and rejoicing in that fact. Beautiful, red-haired Molly ignites a fire in Gary and he eases the pain she feels about her past. Starting a family is something they both want badly to do, and with great joy Molly finds herself pregnant.<br /><br />When she leaves for the hospital that things start to go seriously wrong. Just a few weeks later Gary is alone with a newborn and a mountain of medical bills he has no means to pay for. Desperate for help, he calls on Molly's long estranged sister, Suzanne.<br /><br />Many authors have tackled the challenges of love and marriage. Caroline Leavitt claims the turf in her own exciting way, twisting and turning a medical nightmare into an opportunity for redemption and hope, in <i>Coming Back to Me</i>.",

    "description": "Speaking of Siva is a selection of vacanas or free-verse sayings from the Virasaiva religious movement, dedicated to Siva as the supreme god. Written by four major saints, the greatest exponents of this poetic form, between the tenth and twelfth centuries, they are passionate lyrical expressions of the search for an unpredictable and spontaneous spiritual vision of 'now'. Here, yogic and tantric symbols, riddles and enigmas subvert the language of ordinary experience, as references to night and day, sex and family relationships take on new mystical meanings. These intense poems of personal devotion to a single deity also question traditional belief systems, customs, superstitions, image worship and even moral strictures, in verse that speaks to all men and women regardless of class and caste.",

Due to the high prices, guests have been scarce. Unfortunately, they are becoming even scarcer as someone or something is kidnapping and murdering them. Drawn by the sketchy news accounts, Eleanor Perry has come to Mauna Pele on a sort of pilgrimage, using her aunt Kidder's 1866 travel diary as a guidebook. The events Kidder chronicled-tales of demons conjured up to rid the island of missionaries-seem to parallel the current events. As volcanoes erupt and vengeful gods and demons become more violent, Eleanor and her fellow guest, the indomitable Cordie Stumpf, attempt to get to the bottom of things.",

    "description": "For more than a decade, readers have turned to<i> The Year's Best Fantasy and Horror</i> to find the most rewarding fantastic short stories. Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling continue their critically acclaimed and award-winning tradition with another stunning collection of stories. The fiction and poetry here is culled from an exhaustive survey of the field, nearly four dozen stories ranging from fairy tales to gothic horror, from magical realism to dark tales in the Grand Guignol style. Rounding out the volume are the editors' invaluable overviews of the year in fantasy and horror, a new Year's Best section, on comics, by Charles Vess, and on anime and manga, by Joan D. Vinge, and a long list of Honorable Mentions, making this an indispensable reference as well as the best reading available in fantasy and horror.",

          "description": "The collaborative efforts of <b>Ellen Datlow</b> (horror) and <b>Terri Windling</b> (fantasy) has become somewhat legendary, as year after year they delivered the best horror and fantasy stories and poems in a fat (500 double-length pages) anthology that avoided pigeonholes with its mingled, unlabeled sample of the two genres (winning three World Fantasy Awards and the Bram Stoker Award). They each wrote the detailed and memorable introductions to each field (Horror and Fantasy). In 2004 (volume 16) <b>Terri Windling</b> stepped down to focus on other projects (as artist and writer), and <B>Kelly Link</b> and <b>Gavin Grant</b>, with Terri Windling\u2019s blessings, took over her position under the Fantasy banner. <b>Thomas Canty</b> famously did the beautiful covers.\n    \n    In 2008 (volume 21) this annual collection sadly saw its end, having been published annually since 1988\u2026\n    \n    More info on the anthologies, go here: http://www.gamalei.net/sluice/",

It is a strange place of brooding shrines and gleaming towers, guarded by stone angels. For Sweeney, college is a time to experiment with sex, to explore new friendships. It is a time of freedom and discovery--until she makes the wrong discovery.",

    "description": "<i>\n  <br /></i>In 1942, Hitler's Nazi regime trained eight operatives for a mission to infiltrate America and do devastating damage to its infrastructure. It was a plot that proved historically remarkable for two reasons: the surprising extent of its success and the astounding nature of its failure. Soon after two U-Boats packed with explosives arrived on America's shores\u2013one on Long Island, one in Florida\u2013it became clear that the incompetence of the eight saboteurs was matched only by that of American authorities. In fact, had one of the saboteurs not tipped them off, the FBI might never have caught the plot's perpetrators\u2013though a dozen witnesses saw a submarine moored on Long Island. <br />As told by Michael Dobbs, the story of the botched mission and a subsequent trial by military tribunal, resulting in the swift execution of six saboteurs, offers great insight into the tenor of the country--and the state of American intelligence--during World War II and becomes what is perhaps a cautionary tale for our times.",

And the message is intended for Martha Beck, Adam's mother, who doesn't know whether to make a mad dash for the door to escape a raving lunatic (after all, how many conversations like this one can you have before you stop getting dinner party invitations and start pushing a mp yourself?) or accept another in a series of life lessons from an impeccable but mysterious source.<br /><br />From the moment Martha and her husband, John, accidentally conceived their second child, all hell broke loose. They were a couple obsessed with success. After years of matching IQs and test scores with less driven peers, they had two Harvard degrees apiece and were gunning for more. They'd plotted out a future in the most vaunted ivory tower of academe. But the dream had begun to disintegrate. Then, when their unborn son, Adam, was diagnosed with Down syndrome, doctors, advisers, and friends in the Harvard community warned them that if they decided to keep the baby, they would lose all hope of achieving their carefully crafted goals. Fortunately, that's exactly what happened.<br /><br /><i>Expecting Adam</i> is a poignant, challenging, and achingly funny chronicle of the extraordinary nine months of Martha's pregnancy. By the time Adam was born, Martha and John were propelled into a world in which they were forced to redefine everything of value to them, put all their faith in miracles, and trust that they could fly without a net. And it worked.<br /><br />Martha's riveting, beautifully written memoir captures the abject terror and exhilarating freedom of facing impending parentdom, being forced to question one's deepest beliefs, and rewriting life's rules. It is an unforgettable celebration of the everyday magic that connects human souls to one another.",

    "description": "Reprinting Cerebus Issues 1-25 <br /><br />Welcome to Estarcion, the wildly absurd and funny world of <b>Cerebus the Aardvark</b>. This initial volume collects the first two years of stories from Dave Sim's 300-issue magnum opus. Don't be discouraged by the initially crude artwork or the silliness of the stories. It gets better--even noticeably within this volume. This first installment is the most valuable in preparing for the larger stories ahead.<br /><br />When we first meet Cerebus--a small, gray, and chronically ill-tempered aardvark--he is making his living as a barbarian. In 1977, when the Cerebus comic book series began, Sim initially conceived of it as a parody of such popular series as Conan, Red Sonja, and Elric but quickly mined that material and transformed the scope of the series into much more. Even by the end of this volume, the Cerebus story begins to transform beyond \"funny animal\" humor into something much more complex and interesting.<p> High points in <i>Cerebus</i> include the introduction of Lord Julius, the dictator of Palnu, who looks, acts, and talks just like a certain cigar-smoking, mustachioed comedian; Jaka, Cerebus's one true love; Elrod the Albino, an innept swordsman; and the Cockroach, the-mother-of-all-superhero-parodies and \"inspiration\" for the much-later TV and comic character--the Tick. All of these characters appear later on in the series as part of a constantly present ensemble of supporting figures.<br /><br />Even if <i>Cerebus</i> doesn't knock your socks off, give its successor, <i>High Society</i> a try, as this is where the plot really gets going.</p>",

    "description": "Reprinting Cerebus Issues 175-186<br /><br />The ninth volume of the Cerebus the Aardvark series, <i>Reads</i>, is the penultimate chapter of the larger <i>Mothers and Daughters</i> story. This is one of the most powerful editions in the series and one of the most ambitious narratives that Dave Sim has ever attempted.<p> In addition, <i>Reads</i> is the most controversial volume of the Cerebus series to date because of a parallel narrative involving two characters--Viktor Reid and Viktor Davis--who are both alter egos for Dave Sim. This controversy is a shame because the offensive section in <i>Reads</i>--which explores the relationship between men and women--represents only one possible view of this subject. When read as part of the whole series, the passages that may have seemed shocking to some, appear (like all points of this narrative) to question and provoke rather than offend. Viktor Davis is far from a reliable narrator, an idea that is reinforced by the final paragraphs of his narrative and demonstrated by the scariest of all Cerebus practical jokes. Are Viktor Davis or Viktor Reid representative of Dave Sim or simply aspects of his persona? The ending suggests the answer.</p><p> Meanwhile, Cerebus, Po, Cirin, and Astoria debate the important stuff, including our aardvark friend's genitalia, the history of Illusionism, the nature of power, and the fate of Astoria's child. Despite the bad rap, <i>Reads</i> is Cerebus at its finest. Like the best of art, <i>Reads</i> has the power to shock, surprise, amuse, and offend--and it even has a whiz-bang fight scene. What more could you want?</p>",

This graphic novel concerns the fight between the newly established matriarchy and the opposing \"daughterarchy.\" Cerebus, trying to regain the power he lost when the matriarchal Cirinists took over, heads down a fateful, blood-soaked path. Dave Sim is often reviled as a misogynist because of the radical politics and philosophy laid down in his books, the groundwork of which begins here and builds toward the climax of <i>Mothers &amp; Daughters,</i> which was so explosive that when it was initially released it cost Sim several close friends.",

    "description": "A moving, deeply absorbing story of a family in crisis. What sets it apart from most fiction about difficult subjects such as autism, is the author's ability to write about a sad and frightening situation with a seamless blend of warmth, compassion and humor.<br /><br />Marti Leimbach's first novel, Dying Young, was called \"a masterpiece of details that always ring true, with the sad, funny and fascinating unpredictability of real life.\" With the same talent and perception, Leimbach's new novel takes the reader to London, to the home of the Marshes: Stephen Marsh, a true Brit; Melanie, a transplanted American; and their two children, four-year-old Emily and Daniel, just three. When it is conveyed that Daniel is autistic, the orderly life of the Marsh family is shattered.<br /><br />Melanie is determined to fight to teach Daniel to speak, play and become as \"normal\" as possible. Her enchanting disposition has already helped her weather other of life's storms, but Daniel's autism may just push her over the brink, destroying her resolute optimism and bringing her unsteady marriage to an inglorious end. The situation is not helped by Stephen's far-from-supportive parents, who proudly display the family tree with Melanie's name barely penciled in, and who remain disconcertingly attached to Stephen's ex-fianc\u00e9e, a woman apparently intent on restaking her claim on Stephen. <br /><br />Melanie does have one strong ally in Andy, a talented and off-the-wall play therapist who specializes in teaching autistic children. Andy proves that Daniel is far more capable than anyone imagined, and Melanie finds herself drawn to him even as she staggers toward resolving her marriage.<br /><br />Daniel Isn't Talking is a moving, deeply absorbing story of a family in crisis. What sets it apart from most fiction about difficult subjects is the author's ability to write about a sad and frightening situation with a seamless blend of warmth, compassion and humor.",

Those women who feared their erotic fantasies called it pornographic. Those women who read it recognized in its pages the hidden content of their own sexuality. More outspoken and graphic than any book before its time, \"My Secret Garden\" quickly became a classic study of female sexuality. Today, more than one million women hail this astonishing study as a groundbreaking book-- a liberating force adding a new dimension to their sexual fantasies and lives.",

For each volume, the very best pieces are selected by an editor who is widely recognized as a leading writer in his or her field, making the Best American series the most respected -- and most popular -- of its kind.<br /> Dave Eggers, who will be editing The Best American Nonrequired Reading annually, has once again chosen the best and least-expected fiction, nonfiction, satire, investigative reporting, alternative comics, and more from publications large, small, and on-line -- The Onion, The New Yorker, Shout, Time, Zoetrope, Tin House, Nerve.com,and McSweeney's, to name just a few. Read on for \"Some of the best literature you haven't been reading . . . And it's fantastic. All of it.\" (St. Petersburg Times).<br /><br />Lynda Barry Jonathan Safran Foer Lisa Gabriele Andrea Lee J. T. Leroy Nasdijj ZZ Packer David Sedaris",

He applied thereafter a passion for accuracy and a contempt for myth and romance in compiling this factual record of a disastrous conflict.",

    "description": "The extraordinary life of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the eighteenth-century literary genius who changed the course of history, traced with novelistic verve.<br /><br />Motherless child, failed apprentice, autodidact, impossibly odd lover, Jean-Jacques Rousseau burst unexpectedly onto the eighteenth-century scene as a literary provocateur whose works electrified readers from the start. Rousseau\u2019s impact on American social and political thought remains deep, wide, and, to some, even infuriating. <br /><br />Leo Damrosch beautifully mines Rousseau\u2019s books--The Social Contract, one of the greatest works on political theory and a direct influence on the French and American revolutions; Emile, a groundbreaking treatise on education; and the Confessions, which created the genre of introspective autobiography--as works still uncannily alive and provocative to us today.<br /><br />Damrosch\u2019s triumph is to integrate the story of Rousseau\u2019s extraordinarily original writings with the tumultuous life that produced them. Rousseau\u2019s own words and those of people who knew him help create an accessible, vivid portrait of a questing man whose strangeness--as punishing and punished lover, difficult friend, and father who famously consigned his infant children to a foundling home--still fascinates. This, the first single-volume biography of Rousseau in English, is as masterfully written as it is definitive.<br /><br />Leo Damrosch is the Ernest Bernbaum Professor of Literature at Harvard University. He has written widely on eighteenth-century writers.<br /><br /><br /><br />Praise for Jean-Jacques Rousseau<br /><br />\"Leo Damrosch's vivid biography enables us to plunge deeply into Rousseau's singular life, conjure up its crucial encounters, retrace its twisting paths, and supplement Rousseau's own claims about himself with the detailed, often contradictory testimony of the contemporaries he so unsettled and inspired.\" -- Stephen Greenblatt, author of Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare<br /><br />\"These pages bring to life the Europe of the ancien regime, a desiccated, sybaritic, superstitious, oppressive world about to be terribly and fatally convulsed. And they also bring to astonishing life a great agent of that convulsion, an impossible man whose books helped to make modern life possible. Leo Damrosch not only helps us understand Rousseau, his loves and his hates, his genius and his foolishness. He makes us see Rousseau. And, as he shows again and again in this immensely enjoyable and fast-paced story, that is Rousseau\u2019s special and permanent fascination--because when we see him, we are seeing ourselves.\"-- Louis Menand, author of The Metaphysical Club and American Studies",

Both authoriatative and beautifully told, THE MIDDLE AGES is the full story of the thousand years between the fall of Rome and the Renaissance \u2014 a time that saw the rise of kings and emperors, the flowering of knighthood, the development of Europe, the increasing power of the Church, and the advent of the middle class. With exceptional grace and wit, Morris Bishop vividly reconstructs this distinctive era of European history in a work that will inform and delight scholars and general readers alike.",

    "description": "<em>Learning to Bow</em> has been heralded as one of the funniest, liveliest, and most insightful books ever written about the clash of cultures between America and Japan. With warmth and candor, Bruce Feiler recounts the year he spent as a teacher in a small rural town. Beginning with a ritual outdoor bath and culminating in an all-night trek to the top of Mt. Fuji, Feiler teaches his students about American culture, while they teach him everything from how to properly address an envelope to how to date a Japanese girl.",

He first revisits the old stories--Hermes in Greece, Eshu in West Africa, Krishna in India, Coyote in North America, among others--and then holds them up against the life and work of more recent creators: Picasso, Duchamp, Ginsberg, John Cage, and Frederick Douglass. Authoritative in its scholarship, loose-limbed in its style, <i>Trickster Makes This World </i>ranks among the great works of modern cultural criticism. <br />",

    "description": "In her most provocative book yet, Dr. Laura urgently reminds women that to take proper care of their husbands is to ensure themselves the happiness and satisfaction they yearn for in marriage.<br /><br />Women want to be in love, get married, and live happily ever after. Yet disrespect for men and disregard for the value, feelings, and needs of husbands has fast become the standard for male-female relations in America. Those two attitudes clash in unfortunate ways to create struggle and strife in what could be a beautiful relationship.<br /><br />Countless women call Dr. Laura, unhappy in their marriages and seemingly at a loss to understand the incredible power they have over their men to create the kind of home life they yearn for. Now, in <em>The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands,</em> Dr. Laura shows you\u2014with real-life examples and real-life solutions\u2014how to wield that power to attain all the sexual pleasure, intimacy, love, joy, and peace you want in your life.<br /><br />Dr. Laura's simple principles have changed the lives of millions. Now they can change yours.",

    "description": "The International Conspiracy Explained:<br /><br />This new reset edition, is the best single work available on the evil conspiracy that has been responsible for the devastating wars and continuing conflicts of the past century, and which is now close to its ultimate goal of total world domination through a dictatorial One World Government.<br /><br />Pawns in the Game is written by William Guy Carr, a noted author who had a distinguished career as a Canadian naval officer, including outstanding service during World War II. In this work of sensational and shocking revelations, he shows how the conspiracy of atheistic-materialistic men has manipulated world events to secure ultimate control of the wealth, natural resources and man-power of the entire world.<br /><br />This satanic conspiracy, Carr goes on to show, strives to abolish Christianity and all religions, dismantle all ordered national governments, and weaken and finally destroy patriotism, nations and traditional family life. Pawns in the Game traces the history of the great conspiracy and the World Revolutionary Movement, showing the roles of the Illuminati, the Freemasons, the Communists, and the United Nations. This book shows the conspiracy s part in the American Revolution, the French Revolution, the Communist takeover of Russia, and World War II.<br /><br />In carrying out their long-range plan, Carr shows how the conspirators have come ever closer to reaching their goal through infiltration of key centers of power and influence, by gaining control of central banks and the world money supply, and through manipulation of the press and media.<br /><br />In this important, rousing book, the author sounds the alarm to awaken Christians and patriots to the grave danger of World War Three and an oppressive New World Order. He presents practical measures to expose, counter and ultimately defeat the forces of evil.",

    "description": "With the publication of Kafka's Curse, Achmat Dangor established himself as an utterly singular voice in South African fiction. His new novel, a finalist for the Man Booker Prize and the IMPAC-Dublin Literary Award, is a clear-eyed, witty, yet deeply serious look at South Africa's political history and its damaging legacy in the lives of those who live there.<br />The last time Silas Ali encountered Lieutenant Du Boise, Silas was locked in the back of a police van and the lieutenant was conducting a vicious assault on Silas's wife, Lydia, in revenge for her husband's participation in Nelson Mandela's African National Congress. When Silas sees Du Boise by chance twenty years later, as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is about to deliver its report, crimes from the past erupt into the present, splintering the Alis' fragile peace. Meanwhile Silas and Lydia's son, Mikey, a thoroughly contemporary young hip-hop lothario, contends in unforeseen ways with his parents' pasts.<br />A harrowing story of a brittle family on the crossroads of history and a fearless skewering of the pieties of revolutionary movements, Bitter Fruit is a cautionary tale of how we do, or do not, address the past's deepest wounds.",

    "description": "American drivers park for free on nearly ninety-nine percent of their car trips, and cities require developers to provide ample off-street parking for every new building. The resulting cost? Today we see sprawling cities that are better suited to cars than people and a nationwide fleet of motor vehicles that consume one-eighth of the world's total oil production. Donald Shoup contends in <i>The High Cost of Free Parking</i> that parking is sorely misunderstood and mismanaged by planners, architects, and politicians. He proposes new ways for cities to regulate parking so that Americans can stop paying for free parking's hidden costs.<br />",

    "description": "Jeanne Wakatsuki was seven years old in 1942 when her family was uprooted from their home and sent to live at Manzanar internment camp--with 10,000 other Japanese Americans. Along with searchlight towers and armed guards, Manzanar ludicrously featured cheerleaders, Boy Scouts, sock hops, baton twirling lessons and a dance band called the Jive Bombers who would play any popular song except the\u00a0nation's #1 hit: \"Don't Fence Me In.\"<br /><br /><i>Farewell to Manzanar</i> is the true story of one spirited Japanese-American family's attempt to survive the indignities of forced detention--and of a native-born American child who discovered what it was like to grow up behind barbed wire in the United States.",

    "description": "In her extraordinary bestseller, Adrian Nicole LeBlanc immerses readers in the intricacies of the ghetto, revealing the true sagas lurking behind the headlines of gangsta glamour, gold-drenched drug dealers, and street-corner society. Focusing on two romances - Jessica's dizzying infatuation with a hugely successful young heroin dealer, Boy George, and Coco's first love with Jessica's little brother, Cesar - <i>Random Family</i> is the story of young people trying to outrun their destinies. Jessica and Boy George ride the wild adventure between riches and ruin, while Coco and Cesar stick closer to the street, all four caught in a precarious dance between survival and death. Friends get murdered; the DEA and FBI investigate Boy George; Cesar becomes a fugitive; Jessica and Coco endure homelessness, betrayal, the heartbreaking separation of prison, and, throughout it all, the insidious damage of poverty.<br /><br />Charting the tumultuous cycle of the generations - as girls become mothers, boys become criminals, and hope struggles against deprivation - LeBlanc slips behind the cold statistics and sensationalism and comes back with a riveting, haunting, and true story.",

    "description": "<i>The Conversations</i> is a treasure, essential for any lover or student of film, and a rare, intimate glimpse into the worlds of two accomplished artists who share a great passion for film and storytelling, and whose knowledge and love of the crafts of writing and film shine through.<br /><br />It was on the set of the movie adaptation of his Booker Prize-winning novel, <i>The English Patient</i>, that Michael Ondaatje met the master film and sound editor Walter Murch, and the two began a remarkable personal conversation about the making of films and books in our time that continued over two years. From those conversations stemmed this enlightened, affectionate book -- a mine of wonderful, surprising observations and information about editing, writing and literature, music and sound, the I-Ching, dreams, art and history.<br /><br /><i>The Conversations</i> is filled with stories about how some of the most important movies of the last thirty years were made and about the people who brought them to the screen. It traces the artistic growth of Murch, as well as his friends and contemporaries -- including directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Fred Zinneman and Anthony Minghella -- from the creation of the independent, anti-Hollywood Zoetrope by a handful of brilliant, bearded young men to the recent triumph of <i>Apocalypse Now Redux</i>.<br /><br />Among the films Murch has worked on are <i>American Graffiti</i>, <i>The Conversation</i>, the remake of <i>A Touch of Evil</i>, <i>Julia</i>, <i>Apocalypse Now</i>, <i>The Godfather</i> (all three), <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley</i>, and <i>The English Patient</i>.<br /><br /><i>\"Walter Murch is a true oddity in Hollywood. A genuine intellectual and renaissance man who appears wise and private at the centre of various temporary storms to do with film making and his whole generation of filmmakers. He knows, probably, where a lot of the bodies are buried.\"</i>",

These essays explore and illuminate the roots of Lorde's intellectual development and her deep-seated and longstanding concerns about ways of increasing empowerment among minority women writers and the absolute necessity to explicate the concept of difference\u2014difference according to sex, race, and economic status. The title Sister Outsider finds its source in her poetry collection The Black Unicorn (1978). These poems and the essays in Sister Outsider stress Lorde's oft-stated theme of continuity, particularly of the geographical and intellectual link between Dahomey, Africa, and her emerging self.",

    "description": "En el mundo, algo extra\u00f1o est\u00e1 sucediendo: hay movimientos masivos de gente, lenguas y culturas que crecen dislocadas entre guerras y econom\u00edas en crisis. En pocas palabras, nuestro mundo est\u00e1 cambiando. En este asombroso libro de cuentos, Daniel Alarc\u00f3n transporta al lector de los centros urbanos tercermundistas a las l\u00edneas fragmentadas que muchas veces dividen naciones y personas. Un terrorista sin remordimientos recuerda sus comienzos, un posible inmigrante contempla las consecuencias de irse y no volver jam\u00e1s, un reportero cambia su l\u00e1piz y papel por el tr\u00e1gico disfraz de un payaso callejero. Son guerras tanto nacionales como internas, que se llevan a cabo en la selva, en las calles de Lima o en la intimidad de un apartamento neoyorquino. Son vidas que se viven al margen del mundo globalizado y sin globalizar, son las historias de quienes constantemente viajan entre mundos diferentes sin jam\u00e1s sentirse del todo en casa. Guerra en la Penumbra ilumina las grietas con las que todos tropezamos en el mundo moderno. Daniel Alarc\u00f3n es un talento excepcional, una voz dif\u00edcil de olvidar una vez el libro llega a su extraordinario y devastador desenlace.",

    "description": "Back in print and accompanied by its prequel <i>Puppets</i>, the bestselling <i>Skull Session </i>is a classic tale of suspense. Despite his brilliance, Paul Skoglund hasn't held a steady job for years, partly because of his Tourette's syndrome. When his eccentric, wealthy aunt asks him to take on the repairs of her magnificent hunting lodge, he is in no position to refuse. But then he finds that the rambling old house has been savagely vandalized: he discovers a scene of almost superhuman destruction, a violence mirrored by a series of disappearances and grisly deaths haunting the region. Paul delves into the wreckage, wondering what dark passion\u2014and what strength\u2014could cause such chaos. As state police investigator Mo Ford pursues the mystery through official channels, escalating events force Paul deeper into his family's past and into the darker aspects of his own nature.",

    "description": "<b>Long awaited and much anticipated, <i>The Wu-Tang Manual</i> is The RZA\u2019s first written introduction to the philosophy and history of Hip-Hop\u2019s original Dynasty, the Wu-Tang Clan.</b>Since the release of the revolutionary <i>Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)</i> \u2014 over the course of four seminal group albums and a multitude of ambitious side projects \u2014 the Wu-Tang Clan has constantly redefined what hip-hop can do and where hip-hop can go. Now, after a decade of dark beats and mysterious lyrics hinting at a larger whole, the RZA, the abbot of the legendary Staten Island hip-hop collective, fully reveals, for the first time, the complex, multilayered Wu-Tang Universe in <i>The Wu-Tang Manual</i>.<br /><br />Written in a style that is at once personal and philosophical, <i>The Wu-Tang Manual</i> unravels the intricate web of personalities (and alter egos), warrior codes, numerological systems, and Eastern spiritual ethics that define the Wu-Tang dynasty. Packed with information that reflects the breadth and depth of the RZA\u2019s \u2014 and rest of the Clan\u2019s \u2014 intellectual interests and passions, <i>The Wu-Tang Manual</i> is divided into four books of nine chambers each, for a total of 36 chambers. All together, the book provides the breakdown of essential Wu-Tang components, from basic information about each of the nine core members of Wu-Tang Clan to deeper explorations of the key themes of the Wu-Tang universe, a dictionary-like Wu-Slang lexicon, and an entire section of Wu-Tang\u00a0lyrics with densely annotated explanations of what they mean.<br /><br />Elegantly laid-out and richly printed, the book is designed to reflect the Asian influence on the Wu-Tang universe, which, as the book explains, began with a fascination with kung-fu movies but quickly led to serious study of martial arts and Eastern philosophy and spirituality. The book also includes a map of Shaolin; a trove of never-before-seen photos of the Wu-Tang Clan, including shots of RZA\u2019s trip to China with Sifu Shi Yan-Ming, live shots, and portraits-by Michael Lavine, Craig Wetherby, Sophia Chang, and Frank151; and original illustrations of many of the guiding lights of the Wu-Tang universe. For the hardcore Wu-Tang disciple and the recent initiate alike, <i>The Wu-Tang Manual</i> is the definitive guide to the essence of Wu, one of the most innovative hip-hop groups of all time.<br /><br />The RZA's most recent book, <i>The Tao of Wu</i>, is also available from Riverhead Books.",

    "description": "In this widely acclaimed biographical essay, Christopher Hitchens assesses the life, the achievements, and the myth of the great political writer and participant George Orwell. In true emulative and contrarian style, Hitchens is both admiring and aggressive, sympathetic yet critical, taking true measure of his subject as hero and problem. Answering both the detractors and the false claimants, Hitchens tears down the fa\u00e7ade of sainthood erected by the hagiographers and rebuts the critics point by point. He examines Orwell and his perspectives on fascism, empire, feminism, and Englishness, as well as his outlook on America, a country and culture towards which he exhibited much ambivalence. <br /><br />Whether thinking about empires or dictators, race or class, nationalism or popular culture, Orwell's moral outlook remains indispensable in a world that has undergone vast changes in the fifty years since his death. Combining the best of Hitchens's polemical punch and intellectual elegance in a tightly woven and subtle argument, this book addresses not only why Orwell matters today, but how he will continue to matter in a future, uncertain world. <br /><br />Christopher Hitchens, one of the most incisive minds of our own age, meets Orwell on the page in this provocative encounter of wit, contention and moral truth.",

    "description": "First published in 1993, Transforming a Rape Culture has provided a new understanding of sexual violence and its origins in this culture. This groundbreaking work seeks nothing less than fundamental cultural change: the transformation of basic attitudes about power, gender, race, and sexuality.<br /><br />The editors thoroughly reviewed the book for this new edition, selecting eight new essays that address topics such as rape as war crime, sports and sexual violence, sexual abuse among the clergy, conflict between traditional mores and women's rights in the Asian American and Latin American communities, as well insightful analyses of cyberporn.<br /><br />The diverse contributors are activists, opinion leaders, theologians, policymakers, educators, and authors of both genders. An excellent text for undergraduate classes in Women's Studies, Family Sociology or Criminal Justice, the book is being reissued on the 10th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act.",

It looks good, tastes good, and it's cheap. But the real cost never appears on the menu.<br /><br />Eric Schlosser's explosive bestseller, by turns funny and terrifying, tells the story of our love affair with fast food. He visits the lab that re-creates the smell of strawberries; examines the safety records of abattoirs; reveals why the fries taste so good and what really lurks between the sesame buns--and shows how fast food is transforming not only our diets but our world.<br />(back cover)",

    "description": "In 1953, Samuel Beckett\u2019s <i>Waiting for Godot</i> premiered at a tiny avant-garde theatre in Paris; within five years, it had been translated into more than twenty languages and seen by more than a million spectators. Its startling popularity marked the emergence of a new type of theatre whose proponents\u2014Beckett, Ionesco, Genet, Pinter, and others\u2014shattered dramatic conventions and paid scant attention to psychological realism, while highlighting their characters\u2019 inability to understand one another. In 1961, Martin Esslin gave a name to the phenomenon in his groundbreaking study of these playwrights who dramatized the absurdity at the core of the human condition.<br /><br />Over four decades after its initial publication, Esslin\u2019s landmark book has lost none of its freshness. The questions these dramatists raise about the struggle for meaning in a purposeless world are still as incisive and necessary today as they were when Beckett\u2019s tramps first waited beneath a dying tree on a lonely country road for a mysterious benefactor who would never show. Authoritative, engaging, and eminently readable, <b>The Theatre of the Absurd</b> is nothing short of a classic: vital reading for anyone with an interest in the theatre.",

    "description": "Thirteen tales are unspun from the deeply familiar, and woven anew into a collection of fairy tales that wind back through time. Acclaimed Irish author Emma Donoghue reveals heroines young and old in unexpected alliances--sometimes treacherous, sometimes erotic, but always courageous. Told with luminous voices that shimmer with sensuality and truth, these age-old characters shed their antiquated cloaks to travel a seductive new landscape, radiantly transformed. Cinderella forsakes the handsome prince and runs off with the fairy godmother; Beauty discovers the Beast behind the mask is not so very different from the face she sees in the mirror; Snow White is awakened from slumber by the bittersweet fruit of an unnamed desire. Acclaimed writer Emma Donoghue spins new tales out of old in a magical web of thirteen interconnected stories about power and transformation and choosing one's own path in the world. In these fairy tales, women young and old tell their own stories of love and hate, honor and revenge, passion and deception. Using the intricate patterns and oral rhythms of traditional fairy tales, Emma Donoghue wraps age-old characters in a dazzling new skin. <p>2000 List of Popular Paperbacks for YA</p>",

In this first book-length study of the man, the historian David P. Chandler casts light on the shadowy figure of Pol Pot, illuminating the ideas and behavior of this enigmatic man and his entourage against the background of post-World War II events, providing a key to understanding this horrific, pivotal period of Cambodian history. In this revised edition, Chandler provides new information on the state of Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge following the death of Pol Pot in 1997.",

    "description": "\u2018A rare and remarkable book.' Times Literary Supplement<br /><br />Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Paris VIII. He is a key figure in poststructuralism, and one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century. <br /><br />F\u00e9lix Guattari (1930-1992) was a psychoanalyst at the la Borde Clinic, as well as being a major social theorist and radical activist. <br /><br />A Thousand Plateaus is part of Deleuze and Guattari's landmark philosophical project, Capitalism and Schizophrenia - a project that still sets the terms of contemporary philosophical debate. A Thousand Plateaus provides a compelling analysis of social phenomena and offers fresh alternatives for thinking about philosophy and culture. Its radical perspective provides a toolbox for \u2018nomadic thought' and has had a galvanizing influence on today's anti-capitalist movement.<br /><br />Translated by Brian Massumi.",

Together with three veterans of the St. Vincent\u2019s Home for Boys, he works for small-time mobster Frank Minna\u2019s limo service cum detective agency. Life without Frank Minna, the charismatic King of Brooklyn, would be unimaginable, so who cares if the tasks he sets them are, well, not exactly legal. But when Frank is fatally stabbed, one of Lionel\u2019s colleagues lands in jail, the other two vie for his position, and the victim\u2019s widow skips town. Lionel\u2019s world is suddenly topsy-turvy, and this outcast who has trouble even conversing attempts to untangle the threads of the case while trying to keep the words straight in his head. <i>Motherless Brooklyn</i> is a brilliantly original homage to the classic detective novel by one of the most acclaimed writers of his generation.",

    "description": "\"When we captured Kigali, we thought we would face criminals in the state; instead, we faced a criminal population.\" So a political commissar in the Rwanda Patriotic Front reflected after the 1994 massacre of as many as one million Tutsis in Rwanda. Underlying his statement is the realization that, though ordered by a minority of state functionaries, the slaughter was performed by hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens, including even judges, human rights activists, and doctors, nurses, priests, friends, and spouses of the victims. Indeed, it is its very popularity that makes the Rwandan genocide so unthinkable. This book makes it thinkable.<br /><br /><br /> Rejecting easy explanations of the genocide as a mysterious evil force that was bizarrely unleashed, one of Africa's best-known intellectuals situates the tragedy in its proper context. He coaxes to the surface the historical, geographical, and political forces that made it possible for so many Hutu to turn so brutally on their neighbors. He finds answers in the nature of political identities generated during colonialism, in the failures of the nationalist revolution to transcend these identities, and in regional demographic and political currents that reach well beyond Rwanda. In so doing, Mahmood Mamdani usefully broadens understandings of citizenship and political identity in postcolonial Africa.<br /><br /><br /> There have been few attempts to explain the Rwandan horror, and none has succeeded so well as this one. Mamdani's analysis provides a solid foundation for future studies of the massacre. Even more important, his answers point a way out of crisis: a direction for reforming political identity in central Africa and preventing future tragedies.",

When a scream rings out, followed by a gunshot, they break down the door. The room is empty.<br /><br />Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs are brought in to help with the high-profile investigation and to ferret out a master illusionist they've dubbed \"the conjurer.\" As the fatalities rise and the minutes tick down, Rhyme and Sachs must move beyond the smoke and mirrors to prevent a terrifying act of vengeance that could become the greatest vanishing act of all.",

    "description": "In a riveting thriller from the #1 bestselling Queen of Suspense, a young woman is ensnared into returning to the childhood home she wanted to leave behind forever -- and where her hidden past emerges with a new and deadly twist. Ten-year-old Liza Barton shoots her mother while trying to protect her from her violent husband -- Liza's stepfather. While the death is ruled accidental, the tabloids still compare Liza to the child murderess Lizzie Borden.<br /><br />Liza's adoptive parents change her name to Celia and try to erase all traces of her past. Widowed after a brief marriage in which she had a son, Jack, she remarries a young lawyer. Celia is happy until, on her birthday, he presents her with a gift -- the house where she killed her mother. On moving in, they find the words LITTLE LIZZIE'S PLACE - BEWARE painted in red letters on the lawn. When the real estate agent who sold the house to her husband is murdered, she becomes a suspect. As she struggles to prove her innocence, Celia and her little son are being stalked by the killer.",

    "description": "\"With the lover everyday life recedes,\" Roth writes\u2014and exhibiting all his skill as a brilliant observer of human passion, he presents in <b>Deception</b> the tightly enclosed world of adulterous intimacy with a directness that has no equal in American fiction. At the center of <b>Deception</b> are two adulterers in their hiding place. He is a middle-aged American writer named Philip, living in London, and she is an articulate, intelligent, well-educated Englishwoman compromised by a humiliating marriage to which, in her thirties, she is already nervously half-resigned. The book's action consists of conversation\u2014mainly the lovers talking to each other before and after making love. That dialogue\u2014sharp, rich, playful, inquiring, \"moving,\" as Hermione Lee writes, \"on a scale of pain from furious bafflement to stoic gaiety\"\u2014is nearly all there is to this book, and all there needs to be.",

It was given to Rachel Verinder on her eighteenth birthday and, that same night, stolen again.<br /><br />Sergeant Cuff is employed by Rachel's mother to find the precious stone and has no shortage of suspects. By turns, those on the periphery and at the heart of the mystery tell their version of events until all is unravelled at the unexpected conclusion.",

His sixth sense leads him to Rukia, a Soul Reaper who destroys <i>Hollows</i> (soul-devouring monsters) and ensures the deceased find repose with the Soul Society. When she's injured in battle, Rukia transfers her sword and much of her power to Ichigo, whose spiritual energy makes him a formidable substitute Soul Reaper. But the orange-haired teenager isn't sure he wants the job: too many risks and moral dilemmas.",

Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn of the Navajo Tribal Police has no choice but to suspect the very worst, since the blood that stains the parched New Mexican ground once flowed through the veins of one of the missing, a young Zu\u00f1i. But his investigation into a terrible crime is being complicated by an important archaeological dig . . . and a steel hypodermic needle. And the unique laws and sacred religious rites of the Zu\u00f1i people are throwing impassable roadblocks in Leaphorn's already twisted path, enabling a craven murderer to elude justice or, worse still, to kill again.",

There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues.\u00a0<br /><br />As Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. <b>In Cold Blood</b> is a work that transcends its moment, yielding poignant insights into the nature of American violence.",

So begins Promised Land, the fourth novel by Robert Parker, that follows the exploits of his cerebral but tough character, detective Spenser.

The investigation soon leads him into a complex web of murder, radical politics, adultery, drugs and organised crime.<br /><br />The cops are ready to throw the book at the pretty blond coed whose prints are all over the murder weapon but Spenser knows there are no easy answers. He tackles some very heavy homework and knows that if he doesn't finish his assignment soon, he could end up marked \"D\" -- for dead.",

    "description": "Perhaps the most important work of philosophy written in the twentieth century, <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em> was the only philosophical work that Ludwig Wittgenstein published during his lifetime. Written in short, carefully numbered paragraphs of extreme brilliance, it captured the imagination of a generation of philosophers. For Wittgenstein, logic was something we use to conquer a reality which is in itself both elusive and unobtainable. He famously summarized the book in the following words: 'What can be said at all can be said clearly; and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence.' David Pears and Brian McGuinness received the highest praise for their meticulous translation. The work is prefaced by Bertrand Russell's original introduction to the first English edition.",

At the heart of the story are two people, Iris Courtney, who is white, and handsome Jinx Fairchild, the black basketball player who, in protecting Iris, kills a white man.<br /><br />Iris is the only witness to the crime.<br /><br />The two of them are growing up in the early 1950s in a New York industrial town where racial boundaries keep people apart - or bring them together in explosive scenes of fear or desire. The secret link between Iris and Jinx is not only their attraction to each other, but a murder...and a bond of passion and guilt is formed between them. How this one irrevocable, tragic act shapes their lives and alters their destinies becomes Joyce Carol Oate's finest, emotion-packed novel - a work the critics are calling a masterpiece, the best work of America's best writer of contemporary realism.",

    "description": "The product of an agreeably dotty cleric named Edwin Abbott Abbott and first published in 1884, <i>Flatland</i> distills all that the Victorian era knew of higher mathematics--and then some--into a witty, complex novel of ideas.<p> Ian Stewart, the author of the equally witty sequel, <i>Flatterland</i>--which adds to Abbott's store of science the key discoveries made since--does a superb job of explaining the original book's enigmas, allusions, ironies, implausibilities, and what Douglas Hofstadter would call \"metamagical themas.\" Among other things, Stewart comments on Abbott's comments on such things as the nature/nurture controversy, the fourth dimension and beyond, the role of multidimensional spaces in economic systems, infinite series and perfect squares, celestial mechanics, and other matters close to the hearts of cosmologists and science buffs alike.</p>",

    "description": "Poetry's Ingredients: Mark Strand and Eavan Boland Explore Form<br /><br />Explaining beauty is hard work. But distinguished poets Mark Strand and Eavan Boland have produced a clear, super-helpful book that unravels part of the mystery of great poems through an engaging exploration of poetic structure. Strand and Boland begin by promising to \"look squarely at some of the headaches\" of poetic form: the building blocks of poetry. <i>The Making of a Poem</i> gradually cures many of those headaches.<br /><br />Strand, who's won the Pulitzer Prize and a MacArthur Fellowship and has served as U.S. Poet Laureate, and Boland, an abundantly talented Irish poet who has also written a beautiful book of essays on writing and womanhood, are both accustomed to teaching. Strand, now at the University of Chicago, and Boland, a Stanford professor, draw upon decades in the classroom to anticipate most questions.<br /><p><br />Ever wonder what a pantoum is? A villanelle? A sestina? With humor, patience, and personal anecdotes, Strand and Boland offer answers. But the <i>way</i> they answer is what makes this book stand out. The forms are divided into three overarching categories: metrical forms, shaping forms, and open forms. \"Metrical forms\" include the sonnet, pantoum, and heroic couplet. \"Shaping forms\" explains broader categories, like the elegy, ode, and pastoral poem. And \"open forms\" offers new takes on the traditional blueprints, exploring poems like Allen Ginsberg's \"America.\"<br /><br />Each established form is then approached in three ways, followed by several pages of outstanding poems in that form. First, the editors offer a \"page at a glance\" guide, with five or six characteristics of that specific form presented in a brief outline. For example, the pantoum is defined like this:<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01) Each pantoum stanza must be four lines long.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02) The length is unspecified but the pantoum must begin and end with the <br />same line.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03) The second and fourth lines of the first quatrain become the first and third line of the next, and so on with succeeding quatrains.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04) The rhyming of each quatrain is abab.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05) The final quatrain changes this pattern.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06) In the final quatrain the unrepeated first and third lines are used <br />in reverse as second and fourth lines.<br /><br />With this outline, it's easy to identify the looping pantoum. In the second piece of the pantoum section, Strand and Boland include a \"History of the Form\" section, again condensed to one page. Here, we learn that the pantoum is \"Malayan in origin and came into English, as so many other strict forms have, through France.\" Indeed, both Victor Hugo and Charles Baudelaire tried their hands at the pantoum. As always, Strand and Boland offer some comparison to the other forms, which helps explain why a poet might choose to write a pantoum over, say, a sonnet or a sestina:<br /><br />\"Of all verse forms the pantoum is the slowest. The reader takes four steps forward, then two steps back. It is the perfect form for the evocation of a past time.\" <br /><br />Next, the editors include \"The Contemporary Context,\" which introduces several of the pantoums of this century. Finally, in what may be the book's best feature, they provide a close-up of a pantoum, an approach they repeat for each form discussed. In this case, it's the \"Pantoum of the Great Depression\" by Donald Justice. The editors offer some biographical information on Justice, and then they map out how that specific poem gets its power. <br /><br />This \"poet's explanation\" of the workings of a poem is invaluable, especially when it comes from leading poets such as Stand and Boland. What's more, these remarks are transferable. Reading how Strand and Boland view a dozen poems transforms the way one reads. With any future poem, you can look for what Strand and Boland have found in the greats.<br /><br />The editors offer their readers a great start, with a list for further reading and a helpful glossary. If anything can get a person excited about poetry, this selection of poems can -- though the editors, as working poets, readily admit their choices are idiosyncratic. <br /><br />Gems here include the best work of lesser-known poets, including several \"poets' poets.\" For example, Edward Thomas, a prominent reviewer in his day and a close friend of Robert Frost's, is represented by \"Rain,\" an absolutely brilliant blank-verse poem which begins:<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rain, midnight rain, nothing but wild rain<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On this bleak hut, and solitude, and me<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remembering again that I shall die<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And neither hear the rain nor give it thanks<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For washing me cleaner than I have been <br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since I was born into this solitude. <br /><br /><br />Thomas's poem -- and other treasures here -- introduces readers to what and how poets read to learn to make poems. Of course, many of the usual suspects are found here, but the surprises are exciting, and even the old favorites seem new when the editors explain why and how a particular poem seems beautiful. This is particularly evident in their discussion of Edna St. Vincent Millay's rushing, initially breathless sonnet \"What Lips My Lips Have Kissed, and Where, and How, \" which reads:<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have forgotten, and what arms have lain<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under my head till morning, but the rain<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Upon the glass and listen for reply, <br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For unremembered lads that not again<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Will turn to me at midnight with a cry. <br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus in the winter stands the lonely tree<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor knows what birds have vanquished one by one,<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet knows its boughs more silent than before: <br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I cannot say what loves have come and gone, <br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I only know that summer sang in me<br /><br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A little while, that in me sings no more. <br /><br /></p><p><br />In the \"close-up\" section, Strand and Boland offer an biographical paragraph that mentions that in 1923, Millay became the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize in Poetry. They then discuss Millay's \"distinctive and unusual\" approach to the sonnet form: \"Instead of taking the more leisurely pace of the public sonnet that had been the 19th-century model, she drove her sonnets forward with a powerful lyric music and personal emphasis.\"<br /><br />The editors point out Millay's heavy reliance on assonance and alliteration, and then note how she takes advantage of the different tempos the sonnet offers:<br /><br />\"Here she uses her distinctive music and high diction to produce an unusually quick-paced poem in the first octave and then a slower, more reflective septet where the abandoned lover becomes a winter tree. This ability of the sonnet, to accommodate both lyric and reflective time, made it a perfect vehicle for highly intuitive twentieth-century poets like Millay.\"<br /><br />That simple explanation of the sonnet as a form able to \"accommodate both lyric and reflective time\" helps clarify most sonnets. But Strand and Boland are careful not to explain everything. The deepest beauty, as they explain in their introductory essays on their attraction to form, is built on mystery. And it is that attempt to understand the greatest mysteries that defines the greatest poems. <br /><br />Similarly, mystery often drives poets to write, as Strand explains in his essay on Archibald MacLeish's \"You, Andrew Marvell,\" which Strand describes as the first poem he wished he had written himself in his early years as a poet:<br /><br />\"Although I no longer wish I had written 'You, Andrew Marvell,' I wish, however, that I could write something like it, something with its sweep, its sensuousness, its sad crepuscular beauty, something capable of carving out such a large psychic space for itself&amp;. There is something about it that moves me in ways I don't quite understand, as it were communicating more than what it actually says. This is often the case with good poems -- they have a lyric identity that goes beyond whatever their subject happens to be.\"<br /><br />With this book, Strand and Boland help quantify the explicable parts of a \"lyric identity.\" Understanding form, the editors believe, is one way to begin understanding a poem's beauty. This lucid, useful book is a wonderful guide to that mysterious music.<br /></p><p>\u0097Aviya Kushner</p>",

Her poetic strength lies in her ability to cast poems as modern myths and allegories. Propelled by patterned repetitions and lush cadences, the poems move the reader through a landscape where waking and dream consciousness fuse.<br /><br />Brigit Pegeen Kelly teaches creative writing at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her poetry collections are Song (BOA Editions), the 1994 Lamont Poetry Selection of The Academy of American Poets and a finalist for the 1995 <i>Los Angeles Times Book Award</i>, and <i>To the Place of Trumpets</i>, selected by James Merrill for the 1987 Yale Series of Younger Poets Prize.",

    "description": "Doris Lessing's contemporary gothic horror story\u2014centered on the birth of a baby who seems less than human\u2014probes society's unwillingness to recognize its own brutality.<br /><br />Harriet and David Lovatt, parents of four children, have created an idyll of domestic bliss in defiance of the social trends of late 1960s England. While around them crime and unrest surge, the Lovatts are certain that their old-fashioned contentment can protect them from the world outside\u2014until the birth of their fifth baby. Gruesomely goblin-like in appearance, insatiably hungry, abnormally strong and violent, Ben has nothing innocent or infant-like about him. As he grows older and more terrifying, Harriet finds she cannot love him, David cannot bring himself to touch him, and their four older children are afraid of him. Understanding that he will never be accepted anywhere, Harriet and David are torn between their instincts as parents and their shocked reaction to this fierce and unlovable child whose existence shatters their belief in a benign world.",

With fresh adventures and updates on the characters introduced in <i>Under the Tuscan Sun</i>, Mayes also explores new themes in this wondrous corner of the world, delving into gardening, wine-making, and the experience of primavera - a season of renewed possibility. And Mayes reveals more simple pleasures from her Tuscan kitchen in a section devoted to recipes. In the sensuous, vivid prose that has become her hallmark, <i>Bella Tuscany</i> celebrates Mayes's deepening connection to the land and her flourishing friendships in a newfound haven of idyllic living.",

    "description": "John Rosemond is a renowned child psychologist who has helped millions of parents learn to raise their children and remain sane.<br /><br />In <i>Teen-Proofing</i>, now available in paperback, he tackles the challenges of raising a teenager with his trademark user-friendly, humorous, and commonsense style. Rosemond lays out a perfectly sound and logical case for recognizing the realities of the teen-parent relationship, forming the foundation, and parenting with the \"Long Rope Principle.\" In short, the author demonstrates how Mom and Dad can avoid the pitfalls of becoming dictatorial \"Control Freaks,\" skirt the potholes of turning into permissive \"Wimps,\" and enjoy the freedom and rewards of parenting in a controlled (but not controlling) and relaxed manner. Teenagers, Rosemond readily admits, can be a challenge. But infusing young adults with a sense of personal responsibility, then showing them the results of good and bad choices, is a goal every parent can achieve.",

    "description": "A disillusioned newspaper reporter turned private detective, Ray Dudgeon isn't trying to save the world. He just wants to do an honest job, and do it well. But when doing an honest job threatens society's most powerful and corrupt, Ray's odds for survival make for a sucker's bet. . . . <br /><br /><p>While working on a movie in Chicago, Hollywood locations manager Bob Loniski saw something he shouldn't have. Now he's a prosecution witness against a suspected member of the Chicago Outfit. Petrified, he comes to Ray for protection. Ray's mob contacts insist that they have no interest in Loniski, so he takes the bodyguard gig. <br /><br /></p><p>Then people start dying and everything goes to hell. <br /><br /></p><p>Ray's investigation leads to a stash of blackmail files involving the sex trade, Washington political corruption, and a deadly power struggle among Chicago's organized crime bosses-setting the FBI, the Chicago police, and the mob on his tail. He now holds evidence against top-ranking cops and politicians . . . but with the line between good and bad blurring, he doesn't know who he can trust. <br /><br /></p><p>If he does the right thing, Ray is sure to die. But if he doesn't, how can he live with himself? <br /><br /></p><p>From the back alleys of Chicago to the man-sions of Beverly Hills to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C., Sean Chercover's <i>Big City, Bad Blood</i> propels readers relentlessly forward on a bullet-fast, adrenaline-pumping ride they will not soon forget.</p>",

    "description": "Mary Saunders, a lower-class London schoolgirl, was born into rough cloth but hungered for lace and the trappings of a higher station than her family would ever know. In 18th-century England, Mary's shrewd instincts will get her only so far, and she despairs of the plans made for her to carve out a trade as a seamstress or a maid. Unwilling to bend to such a destiny, Mary strikes out on a painful, fateful journey all her own. Inspired by the obscure historical figure Mary Saunders, Slammerkin is a provocative, graphic tale and a rich feast of an historical novel. Author Emma Donoghue probes the gap between a young girl's quest for freedom and a better life and the shackles that society imposes on her. \"Never give up your liberty.\"",

    "description": "On March 1, 1999, American safari guide Mark Ross was camping with four clients in Uganda searching for endangered mountain gorillas. By day's end, two of these clients and six other tourists were dead at the hands of Rwandan rebels. As a man who loves East Africa, Ross felt betrayed by this horror, which made headlines around the world. He writes, 'The continent has always been the love of my life. Now there is trouble between us.' Dangerous Beauty is the story of that love and trouble. Ross writes here about his close-up encounters with danger and natural beauty in Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and Uganda. He describes his walks in the bush and the way he teaches his clients to read unearthly silences and stillnesses in the wind that signify trouble. He writes about deadly charges by elephants and the electric excitement of witnessing the mass migrations of wildebeest and zebras. He writes, too, in detail about the terrible events of 1999. Imbued with Ross's passion for East Africa, this is an unforgettable account of a life of remarkable adventures, and a memorable vision of a beautiful, deadly, and fragile world.",

But for Dustfinger, the fire-eater brought into being from words, the need to return to the tale has become desperate. When he finds a crooked storyteller with the ability to read him back, Dustfinger leaves behind his young apprentice Farid and plunges into the medieval world of his past. Distraught, Farid goes in search of Meggie, and before long, both are caught inside the book, too. But the story is threatening to evolve in ways neither of them could ever have imagined.",

    "description": "Six million Jews...dead. The monstrosity of Adolph Hitler's 'Third Reich' remains a stunning chapter in the pages of history. Although the power by which he hypnotized an entire nation is legendary, one question in particular begs an answer: Where was the church of Christ? Seduced by the Satanic majesty of The Fuhrer, church leaders throughout Germany allowed the Swastika a prominent place alongside the Christian cross in their sanctuaries. Nationalistic pride replaced the call of God to purity, and with few exceptions, the German church looked away while Adolph Hitler implemented his 'Final Solution' to his Jewish problem. How did this happen? In <i>Hitler's Cross</i>, Erwin W. Lutzer examines the lessons that may be learned from studying the deception of the church: the dangers of confusing &amp;quote;church and state,&amp;quote; how the church lost its focus, the role of God in human tragedy, the parameters of Satan's freedom, the truth behind Hitler's hatred of the Jews, the faithfulness of God to His people who suffer for Him, the comparisons between Hitler's rise and the coming reign of the Antichrist, and America's hidden cross-her dangerous trends. <i>Hitler's Cross</i> is the story of a nation whose church forgot its primary call and discovered its failure too late.<br />",

    "description": "UNLOCKING HARRY POTTER gives you five essential keys for understanding the HARRY POTTER series. Not just who will live or die in DEATHLY HOLLOWS, but how J.K. Rowling created the most successful books of our times. To understand the story behind the stories, John Granger, author of THE HIDDEN KEY TO HARRY POTTER and editor of WHO KILLED ALBUS DUMBLEDORE?, introduces the themes and patterns Rowling uses to write books that resonate with readers of all ages. This book is for \"serious readers\" but Granger writes in a very entertaining style. If you never understood the term \"postmodernism\" or how \"literary alchemy\" is used by great authors from Shakespeare to J.K. Rowling, then this is a fun way to learn. UNLOCKING HARRY POTTER is the only book to examine in depth the importance of what Rowling said in an interview from 1998, that \"to invent this wizard world\" she had to learn about alchemy \"in order to set the parameters and establish the stories' internal logic.\" - . - . - . - . - Here's what other HARRY POTTER authors and experts have to say about UNLOCKING HARRY POTTER: - . - . - . - . - \"I got so hooked I had to stop everything else and just read, read, read. I carried it around the house, read it while using the excercycle, I hid in rooms away from the action of daily life so I could take it all in. I haven't had that reaction to a book since, well, THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. A spectacular read for all serious fans of Rowling's works. Compelling, well-argued, fun and funny. Engaging. Thought provoking. Erudite.\" - Tom Morris, author of IF HARRY POTTER RAN GENERAL ELECTRIC and PHILOSOPHY FOR DUMMIES. - . - . - . - . - \"John Granger peels back the layers of Rowling's stories and sees patterns the rest of us miss - and he never forgets to be a fan, engaging in fun speculation about what will come in the finale. Once more Granger has shown himself to be second to none among Potter commentators and literary sleuths. Some books are meant to be ingested quickly. Not this one. Serious fans of HARRY POTTER will relish it.\" - David Baggett, editor of HARRY POTTER AND PHILOSOPHY.",

    "description": "The hugely anticipated new novel by the author of The Secret History\u2014a best-seller nationwide and around the world, and one of the most astonishing debuts in recent times\u2014The Little Friend is even more transfixing and resonant.<br /><br />In a small Mississippi town, Harriet Cleve Dusfresnes grows up in the shadow of her brother, who\u2014when she was only a baby\u2014was found hanging dead from a black-tupelo tree in their yard. His killer was never identified, nor has his family, in the years since, recovered from the tragedy.<br /><br />For Harriet, who has grown up largely unsupervised, in a world of her own imagination, her brother is a link to a glorious past she has only heard stories about or glimpsed in photograph albums. Fiercely determined, precocious far beyond her twelve years, and steeped in the adventurous literature of Stevenson, Kipling, and Conan Doyle, she resolves, one summer, to solve the murder and exact her revenge. Harriet\u2019s sole ally in this quest, her friend Hely, is devoted to her, but what they soon encounter has nothing to do with child\u2019s play: it is dark, adult, and all too menacing.<br /><br />A revelation of familial longing and sorrow, The Little Friend explores crime and punishment, as well as the hidden complications and consequences that hinder the pursuit of truth and justice. A novel of breathtaking ambition and power, it is rich in moral paradox, insights into human frailty, and storytelling brilliance.",

With an oddball cast of conniving White House staffers, corrupt politicos, sleazy journalists, and rancid pro football coaches, this novel is a brilliant send-up of modern America-and the D.C. three-ring circus-at its most absurdly entertaining.",

Meier wants to make all students capable of participating in and sustaining a democracy. . . . Doubters must read Deborah Meier to take a look at that success up close, to watch it begin and grow and flourish.\" \u2014Lorene Cary, The New York Times Book Review <br /><br />\"Meier pledges her faith 'in the extraordinary untapped capacities of all our children'; but, unlike so many radical reformers, she is also firmly rooted in the reality of the classroom. . . .What has propelled people like Meier from the periphery to the center of the ongoing school debate is the recognition that a new and different form of public school is no longer a luxury.\" \u2014James Traub, The New Yorker <br /><br />\"Written in prose that runs like a clear stream past the sludge of educational discourse. . . .The fate of public education today depends on whether we listen to . . . the Deborah Meiers of the land.\" \u2014Joseph Featherstone, The Nation <br /><br />\"A fiery manifesto of Meier's plan for the salvation of public education.\" \u2014Los Angeles Times <br /><br />\"A book not of blueprints and slogans, but of essays-reflective and analytical. The Power of Their Ideas is the product of a lively mind.\" \u2014The Washington Post <br /><br />\"Anyone who wants to get insight into the current waves of endless 'reform' debate should read it.\" \u2014Philadelphia Inquirer",

    "description": "Drawing on his fascination with African lore and his love of adventure to create a seminal work of fantasy, H. Rider Haggard's <i>She</i> is edited with an introduction by Patrick Brantlinger in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />On his twenty-fifth birthday, Leo Vincey opens the silver casket that his father has left to him. It contains a letter recounting the legend of a white sorceress who rules an African tribe and of his father's quest to find this remote race. To find out for himself if the story is true, Leo and his companions set sail for Zanzibar. There, he is brought face to face with Ayesha, <i>She-who-must-be-obeyed</i>: dictator, femme fatale, tyrant and beauty. She has been waiting for centuries for the true descendant of Kallikrates, her murdered lover, to arrive, and arrive he does - in an unexpected form. Blending breathtaking adventure with a brooding sense of mystery and menace, <i>She</i> is a story of romance, exploration discovery and heroism that has lost none of its power to enthral.<br /><br />Patrick Brantlinger's introduction discusses H. Rider Haggard's experience of Empire, and how he took the Africa of fantasies and wove its magic into <i>She. </i>This edition also includes further reading and explanatory notes.<br /><br />Henry Rider Haggard (1856-1925) was born in Bradenham, Norfolk, the sixth son of a lawyer. In 1875 his father procured for him the post of junior secretary to the Governor of Natal; spending six years in South Africa, he remained fascinated by the country's landscape, wildlife and tribal societies for the rest of his life. Haggard's first novel <i>King Solomon's Mines </i>was published in 1885, shortly after had passed the bar, proving so successful that he was able to move back to Norfolk to concentrate on his writing.<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>She</i>, you might like John Buchan's <i>The Thirty-Nine Steps</i>, also available in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />'It is full of hidden meaning ... the eternal feminine, the immortality of our emotions'<br />Sigmund Freud",

Defining folly as the pursuit by governments of policies contrary to their own interests, despite the availability of feasible alternatives, Tuchman details four decisive turning points in history that illustrate the very heights of folly in government: the Trojan War, the breakup of the Holy See provoked by Renaissance Popes, the loss of the American colonies by Britain's George III &amp; the USA's persistent folly in Vietnam. THE MARCH OF FOLLY brings the people, places &amp; events of history alive for today's reader.",

    "description": "Jas is in trouble. Because of who he is-an eighteen-year-old Asian living in London. Because of the gang he hangs out with. And because of the woman he fancies, Samira, who Jas shouldn't have taken a shining to because she is, as his pals point out, not one of his own. He's in trouble because his education, never mind his career, is going nowhere. And he's fallen into the schemes, games and prejudices of his friends on the streets of the big western city in which he lives. But Jas's main trouble is Jas himself, and he doesn't even know the trouble he's in, and try as hard as he does, he's failing to make sense of what it is to be young, male and what you might say is Indostani in a city that professes to be a melting pot but is a city of racial and religious exclusion zones. Without his parents' aspirations to assimilate, without the gifts of his more academically accomplished contemporaries, Jas is a young man without a survival plan to get by in the big city. He's out of touch, an anachronism posing as young man who's up-to-date, living free-style, making things up as he goes along in suburbs of West London. <br /><br /> Gautam Malkani's extraordinary comic novel portrays the lives of young Muslim, Sikh, and Hindu men in the ethnically charged enclave of one of the biggest western cities, London. A world usually-but wrongly-portrayed as the breeding ground for Islamic militants is, in actuality, a world of money (sometimes), flash cars (usually), cell phones (all the time), rap music and MTV, as well as rivalries and feuds, and the small-time crooks who exploit them. In Malkani's hilarious depiction of multiculturalism, race is no more than a proxy for masculinity, or lack of masculinity, among young men struggling to get by in a remorseless city. Just as Martin Amis and Irving Welsh captured the mood and the ethos of the eighties and nighties, twenty-nine-year-old Gautam Malkani brilliantly evokes the life of immigrants who are not immigrants in <i>Londonstani</i>, bringing an entirely fresh perspective to contemporary fiction as he does so.",

    "description": "When the redoubtable Sir Horace Stanton-Lacy is ordered to South America on business, he leaves his only daughter Sophia with his sister, Elizabeth Rivenhall, in Berkeley Square. Newly arrived from her tour of the Continent, Sophy invites herself into the circle of her relatives. When Lady Ombersley agrees to take in her young niece, no one expects Sophy, who sweeps in and immediately takes the ton by storm. Beautiful, gay, impulsive, shockingly direct, Sophy swept into elegant London society and scattered conventions and traditions before her like wisps in a windstorm. Resourceful, adventurous and utterly indefatigable, Sophy is hardly the mild-mannered girl that the Rivenhalls expect when they agree to take her in. Kind-hearted Aunt Lizzy is shocked, and her arrogant stern cousin Charles Rivenhall, the Ombersley heir, vows to rid his family of her meddlesome ways by marrying her off.<br /><br />But vibrant and irrepressible Sophy was no stranger to managing delicate situations. After all, she'd been keeping opportunistic females away from her widowed father for years. But staying with her relatives could be her biggest challenge yet. But Sophy discovers that her aunt's family is in desperate need of her talent for setting everything right: her aunt's husband is of no use at all, her ruthlessly handsome cousin Charles has tyrannical tendencies that are being aggravated by his pedantic bluestocking fiancee Eugenia Wraxton; her lovely cousin Cecelia was smitten with an utterly unsuitable suitor, a beautiful but feather-brained poet; her cousin Herbert was in dire financial straits and has fallen foul of a money-lender; and the younger children are in desperate need of some fun and freedom, and Sophy's arrived just in time to save them all. <br /><br />With her inimitable mixture of exuberance and grace Sophy became the mainstay of her hilariously bedeviled family, as a horsewoman, social leader and above all, as an ingenious match-maker. Using her signature unorthodox methods, Sophy set out to solve all of their problems. By the time she's done, Sophy has commandeered household and Charles's horses, but she finds herself increasingly drawn to her eldest cousin. Could it be that the Grand Sophy had finally met her match? Can she really be falling in love with him, and he with her? And what of his betrothal to grim Eugenia?",

    "description": "Have you ever dreamed of being locked in a department store at night? The endearing story of Corduroy paints a picture of the adventures that might unfold (for a teddy bear at least) in such a situation. When all the shoppers have gone home for the night, Corduroy climbs down from the shelf to look for his missing button. It's a brave new world! He accidentally gets on an elevator that he thinks <i>must</i> be a mountain and sees the furniture section that he thinks must be a palace. He tries to pull a button off the mattress, but he ends up falling off the bed and knocking over a lamp. The night watchman hears the crash, finds Corduroy, and puts him back on the shelf downstairs. The next morning, he finds that it's his lucky day! A little girl buys him with money she saved in her piggy bank and takes him home to her room. Corduroy decides that this <i>must</i> be home and that Lisa must be his friend. Youngsters will never get tired of this toy-comes-alive tale with a happy ending, so you may also want to seek out Dan Freeman's next creation, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>. <i>(Ages 3 to 8)</i>",

    "description": "Acclaimed cartoonist Chris Ware reveals the outtakes of his genius in these intimate, imaginative, and whimsical sketches collected from the years during which he completed his award-winning graphic novel <i>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth </i>(Pantheon). His novel not only won the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> First Novel prize in 2001 but it has sold over 100,000 copies. This book is as much a companion volume to Jimmy Corrigan --one of the great crossover success stories-- as a tremendous art collection from of one of America's most interesting and popular graphic artist.<br /><br />Chris Ware has a passion for drawing that is surprisingly wide-ranging in style and subject. This book surprises the reader on every page with its sense of spontaneous vision. Architectural drawings from Chicago and interplanetary robot comics collide with cruelly doodled human figures and quietly troubling studies of the still life. A must for people with a passion for modern design and old-fashioned style.",

    "description": "\"People always say I'm going to look back on these days and laugh -- why put it off?\"<br /><br />When Angela Nissel found herself struggling financially while in college, instead of sulking, she decided to entertain herself by creating an online journal that chronicled her day-to-day trials and tribulations. Written with humor and intelligence, her \"Broke Diary\" quickly found an audience as people wrote to Angela to empathize with, console, and laugh with her about her experiences and even share their own. <b>The Broke Diaries</b> is the first complete compilation of her experiences, written in a voice that is funny, unique, and dead-on.<br /><br /><i>On buying ramen noodles: I am sooooooo embarassed. I only have 33 cents. I (please don't laugh) put the money on the counter and quickly attempt to dash out with my Chicken Flavored Salt Noodles. The guy calls me back! I look up instinctively, I should have run . . . Why didn't I run !! He tells me the noodles are 35 cents. I try to apologize sincerely. I thought the sign said 33 cents yesterday, so that's all I brought with me. Could he wait while I ran home and get the 2 cents? I show him my student I.D. to let him know I am not a thief. He shakes his head and motions either for me to get the hell out of his store and <b>never</b> come back again or get the money as <b>do</b> come back. I don't know. He said something like \"Nyeh\" and swiped his hand in my direction. <br />I can't translate hand motions well.<br />The noodles: tasty!!!<br /></i>",

A young woman has been forcibly drowned, her feet chained and sunk in cement. When a second young victim is connected to a prominent family, all hell breaks loose, and the police--and Evelyn--are up against it to find the murderer. Evelyn just wants to get the job done, but is pulled into a web of conflicting loyalties, unexpected relationships, and professional betrayal. When Evelyn suspects that her own teenage daughter has become a pawn in the killer's plans, she must remain true to herself and her skills and follow the evidence to the murderer's door.",

    "description": "Utterly eschewing the general bonhomie surrounding the newly-minted contemporary regard for the comic strip medium as a language of complicated personal expression and artistic sophistication, professional colorist and award-winning letterer F. C. Ware returns to the book trade with \"The ACME Novelty Library,\" a hardcover distillation of all his surviving one-page cartoon jokes with which he tuckpointed the holes of his regular comic book periodical over the past decade.<br /><br />Sometimes claimed to be his \"best work\" by those who really don't know any better, this definitive congestion of stories of the future, the old west, and even of modern life nonetheless tries to stay interesting by including a luminescent map of the heavens, a chart of the general structure of the universe, assorted cut-out activitites, and a complete history of The ACME Novelty Company itself, decorated by rare photographs, early business ventures, not to mention the smallest example of a Comic Strip ever before offered to the general public. All in all, it will likely prove a rather mild disappointment, but at least it catches the light in a nice way and may force a smile here and there before being shelved for the next generation's ultimate disregard and/or disposal.",

    "description": "In the tradition of the #1 best-seller SeinLanguage, Bantam Books proudly presents the first book by Paul Reiser, television's sharpest, funniest observer of love, marriage and other mysteries of life. A veteran comic performer, Reiser is best-known as the co-creator and star of the highly-rated NBC comedy, \"Mad About You,\" which \"Time\" Magazine called \"The season's best new sitcom\"in its 1992 debut. Every Thursday night more than twenty million viewers watch as Paul Reiser reveals the most intimate and hilarious scenes of a marriage. Now for the first time, Reiser brings his trademark wit to the page in a book that will delight his eagerly-awaiting audience, and anyone else who has ever fallen in love--or tried not to. In Couplehood, a \"New York Times\" bestseller for more than 40 weeks, Reiser reflects on what it means to be half of a couple -- everything from the science of hand holding, to the technique of tag-team storytelling, to the politics of food and why it always seems to come down to chicken or fish.NBC's hit comedy, \"Mad About You,\" has collected his comic observationsabout life and love in\" Couplehood,\" a New York Times bestseller for morethan 40 weeks.<br /><br />In \"Couplehood,\" Reiser reflects on what it means to be half of a couple-- everything from the science of hand holding, to the technique of tag-teamstorytelling, to the politics of food and why it always seems to come down tochicken or fish.<br /><br />Cited by \"Time\" magazine as \"the season's best new sitcom\" in its 1992debut,",

    "description": "Two congregations worship at the Holy Spirit Church. By day Catholics kneel at the altar of the tiny chapel in Kew Gardens, Queens. But at night the rafters echo with Satan's music. Feared by the Vatican and as old as Christianity itself, a terrifying alternate religion has flourished in the darkness for two millennia, keeping alive the blood rituals of the Middle Ages while embracing the gods of high technology. Preparing the way for the evil product of thousands of years of genetic engineering--the birth of the Monstrum--the anti-man and the death of humanity.",

The only clues to his former existence lie in his apparent skill with a sword and the fragmented dreams that permeate his sleep.<br /><br />Alone in a hostile world he moves from village to village, masquerading as a god to obtain food and shelter. But the shadow of his past pursues him relentlessly. It whispers to him a riddle far more complex than he could ever have imagined - and a truth he may not wish to believe.<br /><br />",

    "description": "Jack Kerouac is best known through the image he put forth in his autobiographical novels. Yet it is only his private journals, in which he set down the raw material of his life and thinking, that reveal to us the real Kerouac. In <b>Windblown World</b>, distinguished Americanist Douglas Brinkley has gathered a selection of journal entries from the most pivotal period of Kerouac\u2019s life, 1947 to 1954. Here is Kerouac as a hungry young writer finishing his first novel while forging crucial friendships with Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, and Neal Cassady. Truly a self-portrait of the artist as a young man, this unique and indispensable volume is sure to become an integral element of the Beat oeuvre.",

    "description": "Fresh from finishing university in England, Adam Woods arrives in Venice to begin a new chapter in his life. He soon secures employment as the personal assistant of Gordon Crace -- a famous expatriate novelist who makes his home in a dank and crumbling palazzo, surrounded by fabulous works of art, piles of unanswered correspondence and the memories of his former literary glory. Before long Adam becomes indispensable to the feeble Crace, and he finds himself at once drawn to and repelled by his elderly employer's brilliant mind and eccentric habits. As Adam comes to learn more about the scandal that brought Crace to Venice years ago, he realizes he has stumbled upon the raw material that could launch his own literary career and makes a bold decision: He will secretly write the famous author's biography. But outsmarting Crace is easier said than done, and the two soon find themselves locked in a bitter contest over the right to determine how the story of Crace's life will end. Against the haunting backdrop of the serene city, the two men engage in a ruthless game of cat and mouse that builds to a breathtaking and unexpected conclusion.",

    "description": "This first book from Chicago author Chris Ware is a pleasantly-decorated view at a lonely and emotionally-impaired \"everyman\" (<i>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</i>), who is provided, at age 36, the opportunity to meet his father for the first time. An improvisatory romance which gingerly deports itself between 1890's Chicago and 1980's small town Michigan, the reader is helped along by thousands of colored illustrations and diagrams, which, when read rapidly in sequence, provide a convincing illusion of life and movement. The bulk of the work is supported by fold-out instructions, an index, paper cut-outs, and a brief apology, all of which concrete to form a rich portrait of a man stunted by a paralyzing fear of being disliked.",

    "description": "In Spoken Here, Mark Abley takes us on a world tour from the Arctic Circle to Oklahoma to Australia in a fervent quest to document some of the world's most endangered languages. His mission is urgent: Of the six thousand languages spoken in the world today, only six hundred may survive into the next century. Abley visits the exotic and frequently remote locales that are home to fading languages and constructs engaging and entertaining portraits of some of the last living speakers of these tongues. Throughout this exhilarating travelogue, he points out that the same forces that put biological species at risk -- development, globalization, loss of habitat -- are also threatening human languages, and with them, something very basic about their speakers' cultures.",

    "description": "From Christopher Moore, author of Fluke, comes a quirky, irreverent novel of love, myth, metaphysics, outlaw biking, angst, and outrageous redemption.<br /><br />As a boy growing up in Montana, he was Samson Hunts Alone -- until a deadly misunderstanding with the law forced him to flee the Crow reservation at age fifteen. Today he is Samuel Hunter, a successful Santa Barbara insurance salesman with a Mercedes, a condo, and a hollow, invented life. Then one day, shortly after his thirty-fifth birthday, destiny offers him the dangerous gift of love -- in the exquisite form of Calliope Kincaid -- and a curse in the unheralded appearance of an ancient Indian god by the name of Coyote. Coyote, the trickster, has arrived to transform tranquillity into chaos, to reawaken the mystical storyteller within Sam ... and to seriously screw up his existence in the process.",

    "description": "What do we mean when we say that someone is a writer? Is he or she an entertainer? A high priest of the god of Art? An improver of readers' minds and morals? And who, for that matter, are these mysterious readers? In this wise and irresistibly quotable book, one of the most intelligent writers now working in English addresses the riddle of her art: why people pursue it, how they view their calling, and what bargains they make with their audience, both real and imagined.<br /><br />To these fascinating issues Margaret Atwood brings a candid appraisal of her own experience as a breadth of reading that encompasses everything from Dante to Elmore Leonard. An ambitious artistic inquiry conducted with unpretentiousness and charm, <i>Negotiating with the Dead</i> is an unprecedented insider's view of the writer's universe.",

With a voice that is \u201cfunny, frank and full of gritty details\u201d (<em>New York Daily News</em>), she tells of enlisting under Clinton; of learning Arabic; of the sense of duty that fractured her relationships; of being surrounded by bravery and bigotry, sexism and fear; of seeing 9/11 on Al-Jazeera; and of knowing she would be going to war.<br /><br /><br />With a passion that makes her memoir \u201cnearly impossible to put down\u201d (<em>Buffalo News</em>) Williams shares the powerful gamut of her experiences in Iraq, from caring for a wounded civilian to aiming a rifle at a child. Angry at the bureaucracy and the conflicting messages of today\u2019s military, Williams offers us \u201ca raw, unadulterated look at war\u201d (<em>San Antonio Express News</em>) and at the U.S. Army. And she gives us a woman\u2019s story of empowerment and self-discovery.",

Probably best known as the author of \"The Yellow Wallpaper,\" in which a woman is driven mad by chauvinist psychiatry, Gilman wrote numerous other short stories and novels reflecting her radical socialist and feminist view of turn-of-the-century America. Collected here by the noted Gilman scholar Ann J. Lane are eighteen stories and fragments, including a selection from Herland, Gilman's novel of a feminist utopia. The resulting anthology provides a provocative blueprint to Gilman's intellectual and creative production.<br />Content:<br /><br />The yellow wallpaper<br />If I were a man<br />Turned<br />The cottagette<br />An honest woman<br />Making a change<br />Mr. Peebles' heart<br />The widow's might<br />Selections from Herland<br />Selections from Women and economics : a study of the economic relation between men and women<br />Selections from The man-made world : our androcentric culture.",

With an obsession for the <i>Guinness Book of Records</i>, a keenly inquisitive mind, and a kind of faith, John remains hopeful despite the unfavorable cards life deals him.<br />This is one year in a boy's life. On the cusp of adolescence, from his changing voice and body, through to his parents\u2019 difficult travails and the near collapse of his sanity, John is like a tuning fork sensitive to the vibrations within himself and the trouble that this creates for he and his family.<br /><i>Carry Me Down</i> is a restrained, emotionally taut, and sometimes outrageously funny portrait whose drama drives toward, but narrowly averts, an unthinkable disaster.",

At the same time, from The House of Life, Osiris sends forth his son, Horus, on the same mission to destroy utterly &amp; forever The Prince Who Was a Thousand.<br /><br /> But neither of these superhuman warriors is prepared for the strange &amp; harrowing world of mortal life. The Thing That Cries in the Night may well destroy not only their worlds, but all humankind.<br /><br /> As Zelazny did with the Hindu pantheon in the legendary, groundbreaking classic <i>Lord of Light</i>, the master storyteller here breathes new life into the Egyptian gods with another dazzling tale of mythology and imagination.",

    "description": "While many other novels are still nursing hangovers from the 20th century, <i>The PowerBook</i> has risen early to greet the challenge of the new millennium. Set in cyberspace, Jeanette Winterson's seventh novel (or eighth, if you count her disowned <i>Boating for Beginners</i>) travels with ease, casting the net of its love story over Paris, Capri, and London. Its interactive narrator, Ali, is a \"language costumier\" who will swathe your imagination in the clothes of transformation: all you have to do is decide whom you want to be. Ali--known also as Alix--is a virtual narrator in a networked world of e-writing. You are the reader, invited to inhabit the story--any story--you wish to be told. As in all the best video games, you can choose your location, your character, even the clothes you want to wear. Beware: you can enter and play, but you cannot determine the outcome. <p> Ali/x is a digital Orlando for the modern age, moving across time and through transmutations of identity, weaving her stories with \"long lines of laptop DNA\" and shaping herself to the reader's desire. She wants to make love as simple as a song, but even in cyberspace there is no love without pain. Ali/x offers a stranger on the other side of the screen the opportunity of freedom for one night. She falls in love with her beautiful stranger, and finds herself reinvented by her own story. </p><p> <i>The PowerBook</i> is rich with historical allegory and literary allusion. Winterson's dialogue crackles with humor, snappy dialogue, and good jokes, several of which are at her own expense. This is a world of disguise, boundary crossing, and emotional diversions that change the navigation of the plot of life. Strangely sprouting tulips are erected in place of the phallus. Husbands and wives are uncoupled. Lovers disappear in the night to escape from themselves. On the hard drive of <i>The PowerBook</i> are stored a variety of stories that the reader can download and open at will, complete stories that loop through the central narrative. The tale of Mallory's third expedition, the disinterring of the Roman Governor of London in Spitalfields Church, or the contemplation of \"great and ruinous lovers\" are capsules of narrative compression. In Winterson's compacted meaning, language becomes a character in its own right--it is one of the heroes of the novel. </p><p> \"What I am seeking to do in my work is to make a form that answers to 21st-century needs,\" Winterson has written. <i>The PowerBook</i> does just that. Her prose has found a metaphor for its linguistic forms of creation that feels almost invented for her, \"a web of coordinates that will change the world.\" There will be a virtual rush of Internet-themed books in the networked naughties. With <i>The PowerBook</i> Winterson has triumphantly gotten there first. <i>--Rachel Holmes</i></p>",

A magical, timeless summer in the life of a twelve-year-old boy named Douglas Spaulding--remembered forever by the incomparable Ray Bradbury. \"Bradbury is an authentic original.\" -- \"Time\"",

    "description": "<i>Litany of the Long Sun</i> contains the full texts of <i>Nightside the Long Sun</i> and <i>Lake of the Long Sun</i>, that together make up the first half of The Book of the Long Sun. This great work is set on a huge generation starship in the same future as the classic Book of the New Sun (also available in two volumes from Orb).<br /><br />Gene Wolfe's Book of the Long Sun tetralogy ranks as one of the greatest literary achievements of 20th-century science fiction. Litany of the Long Sun, comprising the first two books in the series, is suffused with looming transcendence and theophany. Wolfe takes familiar speculative fiction tropes and embeds them in a tale so complex and wonderful that readers may find themselves wondering whether what they're reading is science fiction, fantasy, or something different altogether. Or whether it matters.<br />The story of Patera Silk, a devout priest whose destiny is wrapped up with the gods he serves, takes place within the Whorl, a vast, cylindrical starship that has traveled for generations and is crumbling into disrepair. Through a strange and amazing series of events, Silk finds himself descending to base thievery, running afoul of a notorious crime lord, befriending a cyborg soldier, and encountering at least one of the gods of Mainframe.<br /><br />But when Silk encounters the Outsider, who may be a God of a very different sort, all his beliefs are shaken to the core, and his life swiftly takes a messianic turn. In a rousing climax, Silk becomes the reluctant leader of a political rebellion against the corrupt Ayuntamiento, who rule the city-state of Viron.<br /><br />It is not necessary to have read Wolfe's Book of the New Sun series, which takes place many centuries earlier, to enjoy the Long Sun novels, but keen-eyed readers will find many clues as to the origin of the Whorl and its gods in those stories. Further, although Wolfe's reputation for literary precision and trickery is well deserved, the Long Sun series (which continues in Epiphany of the Long Sun) is one of the more accessible places to start appreciating the author's treasures. --Therese Littleton<br /><br />",

    "description": "<i>Austerlitz</i>, the internationally acclaimed masterpiece by \u201cone of the most gripping writers imaginable\u201d (<i>The New York Review of Books</i>), is the story of a man\u2019s search for the answer to his life\u2019s central riddle. A small child when he comes to England on a <i>Kindertransport</i> in the summer of 1939, one Jacques Aus-terlitz is told nothing of his real family by the Welsh Methodist minister and his wife who raise him. When he is a much older man, fleeting memories return to him, and obeying an instinct he only dimly understands, he follows their trail back to the world he left behind a half century before. There, faced with the void at the heart of twentieth-century Europe, he struggles to rescue his heritage from oblivion.",

    "description": "Did you ever wonder why cheap wine tastes better in fancy glasses? Why sales of Macintosh computers soared when Apple introduced the colorful iMac? New research on emotion and cognition has shown that attractive things really do work better, a fact fans of Don Norman's classic <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i> cannot afford to ignore.In recent years, the design community has focused on making products easier to use. But as Norman amply demonstrates in this fascinating and important new book, design experts have vastly underestimated the role of emotion on our experience of everyday objects.<i>Emotional Design</i> analyzes the profound influence of this deceptively simple idea, from our willingness to spend thousands of dollars on Gucci bags and Rolex watches to the impact of emotion on the everyday objects of tomorrow. In the future, will inanimate objects respond to human emotions? Is it possible to create emotional robots?Norman addresses these provocative questions--drawing on a wealth of examples and the latest scientific insights--in this bold exploration of the objects in our everyday world.",

    "description": "Inheriting the mantle of revolutionary biologist from Darwin, Watson, and Crick, Richard Dawkins forced an enormous change in the way we see ourselves and the world with the publication of <i>The Selfish Gene</i>. Suppose, instead of thinking about organisms using genes to reproduce themselves, as we had since Mendel's work was rediscovered, we turn it around and imagine that \"our\" genes build and maintain us in order to make more genes. That simple reversal seems to answer many puzzlers which had stumped scientists for years, and we haven't thought of evolution in the same way since. <p> Why are there miles and miles of \"unused\" DNA within each of our bodies? Why should a bee give up its own chance to reproduce to help raise her sisters and brothers? With a prophet's clarity, Dawkins told us the answers from the perspective of molecules competing for limited space and resources to produce more of their own kind. Drawing fascinating examples from every field of biology, he paved the way for a serious re-evaluation of evolution. He also introduced the concept of self-reproducing ideas, or <i>memes</i>, which (seemingly) use humans exclusively for their propagation. If we are puppets, he says, at least we can try to understand our strings. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>",

    "description": "<i>Moneyball</i> is a quest for something as elusive as the Holy Grail, something that money apparently can't buy: the secret of success in baseball. The logical places to look would be the front offices of major league teams and the dugouts, perhaps even in the minds of the players themselves. Michael Lewis mines all these possibilities - his intimate and original portraits of big league ballplayers are alone worth the price of admission - but the real jackpot is a cache of numbers - numbers! - collected over the years by a strange brotherhood of amateur baseball enthusiasts: software engineers, statisticians, Wall Street analysts, layers, and physics professors.<br /><br />What these geek numbers show - no, prove - is that the traditional yardsticks of success for players and teams are fatally flawed. Even the box score misleads us by ignoring the crucial importance of the humble base on balls. The information has been around for years, and nobody inside Major League Baseball paid it any mind. And then came Billy Beane, general manager of the Oakland Athletics.<br /><br />Billy paid attention to those numbers - with the second-lowest payroll in baseball at his disposal, he <i>had</i> to - and this book records his astonishing experiment in finding and fielding a team that nobody else wanted. <i>Moneyball</i> is a roller coaster ride: before the 2002 season opens, Oakland must relinquish its three most prominent (and expensive) players, is written off by just about everyone, and comes roaring back to challenge the American League record for consecutive wins.<br /><br />In a narrative full of fabulous characters and brilliant excursions into the unexpected, Lewis shows us how and why the new baseball knowledge works. He also sets up a sly and hilarious morality tale: Big Money, like Goliath, is always supposed to win... how can we not cheer for David?",

    "description": "With a new Afterword addressing today\u2019s financial crisis<br /><br />A<i> BUSINESS WEEK </i>BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR<br /><br />In this business classic\u2014now with a new Afterword in which the author draws parallels to the recent financial crisis\u2014Roger Lowenstein captures the gripping roller-coaster ride of Long-Term Capital Management. Drawing on confidential internal memos and interviews with dozens of key players, Lowenstein explains not just how the fund made and lost its money but also how the personalities of Long-Term\u2019s partners, the arrogance of their mathematical certainties, and the culture of Wall Street itself contributed to both their rise and their fall.<br /><br />When it was founded in 1993, Long-Term was hailed as the most impressive hedge fund in history. But after four years in which the firm dazzled Wall Street as a $100 billion moneymaking juggernaut, it suddenly suffered catastrophic losses that jeopardized not only the biggest banks on Wall Street but the stability of the financial system itself. The dramatic story of Long-Term\u2019s fall is now a chilling harbinger of the crisis that would strike all of Wall Street, from Lehman Brothers to AIG, a decade later. In his new Afterword, Lowenstein shows that LTCM\u2019s implosion should be seen not as a one-off drama but as a template for market meltdowns in an age of instability\u2014and as a wake-up call that Wall Street and government alike tragically ignored.",

    "description": "Blonde AmbitionCandace Bushnell created a sensation with her first book, Sex and the City, spawning an HBO series that has become a phenomenon. With her sharp insight and uncensored observations of the mating rituals of the Manhattan elite, Bushnell has become a celebrity in her own right--on television, on the newsstands, and in bookstores across the globe.<br /><br />In a new collection of stories, 4 Blondes, the romantic intrigues, betrayals, victories, and insecurities of four modern women are told with Bushnell's keen wit and sardonic eye. A beautiful B-list model in \"Nice N'Easy\" attaches herself yearly to the man with the largest summer house in the Hamptons, but she soon realizes that snagging a rich man and living in a fancy beach house won't necessarily bring her happiness. In \"Highlights (for Adults),\" a high-powered magazine columnist doesn't feel that she needs a man; an examination of her deteriorating marriage shows that her literary journalist husband could never live up to her sexual or emotional expectations. Too many expectations overwhelm Princess Cecilia in \"Platinum\"; her marriage to \"the world's most eligible bachelor\" leads to a descent into paranoia that she chronicles in her journal. And in \"Single Process,\" an aging \"It girl\" worries that she is getting too old to meet a local eligible bachelor, so she travels to London in search of a husband, where she makes pithy observations about the differences between British and American men.<br /><br />Once again, Bushnell returns to the land of the pretty and the powerful, breaking down bedroom doors with her wry humor and frank portrayals of love and lust among the \"It people.\"<br />",

    "description": "The publication of \"Self-Help\" introduced readers to Lorrie Moore's refined blend of humor and insight, and made her one of the best-loved writers of her generation. These stories, told in a voice that is at once witty, melancholy, and bravely honest, paint a tableau of lovers and family, of loss and pleasure, desire and memory. From the young secretary who by day hopes someone will notice her Phi Beta Kappa key and by night makes love to a married man she met at a Florsheim shoe store, to the shattering of a marriage by the shores of a tranquil lake, \"Self-Help\" is a unique, enduring work of short fiction.",

    "description": "Lost in love and don't know much? Paul Feig knew even less...<br /><br />Like any other red-blooded, straight young man, Paul Feig spent much of his teenage years trying to solve the mystery of women. Unlike most red-blooded, straight teenage boys, however, Paul Feig was sadly at a considerable disadvantage. He was tall and gangly. He had a love for musical theater. And, perhaps the death knell for his burgeoning sex life, Paul was a tap dance student. (And we have the pictures to prove it\u2014see the front cover.)<br /><br />Infused with the same witty and infectiously readable style of his first book, <i>Kick Me</i>, <i>Superstud </i>chronicles the trials and tribulations of Feig\u2019s young dating life with all the same excruciating detail as an on-air gastric bypass\u2014and you just won\u2019t be able to tear yourself away. Feig\u2019s series of shudder-to-think but oddly familiar (come on\u2014we\u2019ve all been dumped by someone we didn\u2019t even like that much) anecdotes include: his first date, at an REO Speedwagon concert with the most endowed girl in school, who leaves him sitting next to a puddle of puke; his first breakup, accomplished by moving across the country; his mortifying date with his secretly bigoted girlfriend; his discovery of a new self-love technique that almost lands him in the hospital; and his less-than-idealistic \u201cfirst time,\u201d which he nevertheless elevates to biblical proportions. <br /><br />In <i>Superstud</i>, Paul Feig tells all in a hilarious but true testament to geekdom, love, and growing up.",

    "description": "<i>Tendencies</i> brings together for the first time the essays that have made Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick \"the soft-spoken queen of gay studies\" (<i>Rolling Stone</i>). Combining poetry, wit, polemic, and dazzling scholarship with memorial and autobiography, these essays have set new standards of passion and truthfulness for current theoretical writing.<br /><br />The essays range from Diderot, Oscar Wilde, and Henry James to queer kids and twelve-step programs; from \"Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl\" to a performance piece on Divine written with Michael Moon; from political correctness and the poetics of spanking to the experience of breast cancer in a world ravaged and reshaped by AIDS. What unites <i>Tendencies</i> is a vision of a new queer politics and thought that, however demanding and dangerous, can also be intent, inclusive, writerly, physical, and sometimes giddily fun.",

    "description": "In a book full of playful irony and striking insights, the controversial social philosopher Gilles Lipovetsky draws on the history of fashion to demonstrate that the modern cult of appearance and superficiality actually serves the common good. Focusing on clothing, bodily deportment, sex roles, sexual practices, and political rhetoric as forms of \"fashion,\" Lipovetsky bounds across two thousand years of history, showing how the evolution of fashion from an upper-class privilege into a vehicle of popular expression closely follows the rise of democratic values. Whereas Tocqueville feared that mass culture would create passive citizens incapable of political reasoning, Lipovetsky argues that today's mass-produced fashion offers many choices, which in turn enable consumers to become complex individuals within a consolidated, democratically educated society.<br /><br />Superficiality fosters tolerance among different groups within a society, claims Lipovetsky. To analyze fashion's role in smoothing over social conflict, he abandons class analysis in favor of an inquiry into the symbolism of everyday life and the creation of ephemeral desire. Lipovetsky examines the malaise experienced by people who, because they can fulfill so many desires, lose their sense of identity. His conclusions raise disturbing questions about personal joy and anguish in modern democracy.",

    "description": "A vividly illustrated bedtime story that shows how the unconditional love of a mother can be tested through the relentless questions of her little boy.<br /><br /> \"But Mama, but Mama, what if I were a super smelly skunk, and I smelled so bad that my name was Stinky Face?\"<br /><br /> Mothers love their children and this unconditional love is truly tested in<i> I Love You, Stinky Face</i>. Lisa McCourt and Cyd Moore beautifully weave a reassuring tale of the love and affection of a parent. The imaginative son turns himself into a meat-eating dinosaur, a swamp creature and much, much more before being satisfied with the fact that no matter how stinky he is or how slimy of a creature he could possibly be, he is loved and nothing will change that.",

And, if she is, whether the father is a vampire, a werewolf, or someone else entirely, he knows perfectly well that being a Federal Marshal known for raising the dead and being a vampire executioner, is no way to bring up a baby.",

          "description": "Series of urban fantasy novels, narrated by title character, Anita Blake. Anita lives in a parallel universe, much like our own, save that not only do things like vampires and shapeshifters exist, but their presence is public knowledge. The novels follow Anita's conflicts with the supernatural as she attempts to solve a variety of mysteries, come to terms with her abilities, and navigate a complex series of romantic and political relationships. <i>(edited from Wikipedia)</i>\n    \n    Please note: Each book in this series is a whole story with a beginning and an ending, however the plot of each book relies heavily on the prior books in the series. It is recommended that you read the full length novels - including the novellas like \"Micah\" and \"Flirt\" - in the order they were published. At this time, the author has no plans on ending the series.\n    \n    See also <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/69802-anita-blake-vampire-hunter-graphic-novels\">the graphic novel adaptations</a>.\n    \n    Reading Order per author's <a href=\"http://www.laurellkhamilton.org/works/\">website</a> & Facebook posting <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/laurell-k-hamilton/current-list-of-anita-blake-works/10152399083544352\">Current List of Anita Blake Works</a>.",

But Turin lived under the curse of a hateful dragon - and the lord's secret identity hid more than he knew.<br /><b>THE SECOND AGE</b><br />Prince Aldarion's heart belonged to Erendis, but his passion lay with the ocean, and the great ships that sailed beyond the sight of the land. But no man could serve two mistresses - and no mortal's love could withstand the lure of the sea.<br /><b>THE THIRD AGE</b><br />The great warrior Isildur escaped with the One Ring, cut from the Dark Lord Sauron's hand, to hide it from Evil's grasp. But Isildur would learn the burden of a ringbearer - and of its temptation and despair.",

Now, the book that reignited the feminist movement is back in a fifteenth anniversary edition, with a new preface by the author that brings backlash consciousness up to date. <br /><br />When it was first published, <i>Backlash</i> made headlines for puncturing such favorite media myths as the \u201cinfertility epidemic\u201d and the \u201cman shortage,\u201d myths that defied statistical realities. These willfully fictitious media campaigns added up to an antifeminist backlash. Whatever progress feminism has recently made, Faludi\u2019s words today seem prophetic. The media still love stories about stay-at-home moms and the \u201cdangers\u201d of women\u2019s career ambitions; the glass ceiling is still low; women are still punished for wanting to succeed; basic reproductive rights are still hanging by a thread. The backlash clearly exists.<br /><br />With passion and precision, Faludi shows in her new preface how the creators of commercial culture distort feminist concepts to sell products while selling women downstream, how the feminist ethic of economic independence is twisted into the consumer ethic of buying power, and how the feminist quest for self-determination is warped into a self-centered quest for self-improvement. <i>Backlash</i> is a classic of feminism, an alarm bell for women of every generation, reminding us of the dangers that we still face.",

    "description": "After the end of World War II, the United States, by far the dominant economic and military power at that time, joined with the surviving capitalist democracies to create an unprecedented institutional framework. By the 1980s many contended that these institutions--the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (now the World Trade Organization), the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund--were threatened by growing economic nationalism in the United States, as demonstrated by increased trade protection and growing budget deficits.<br /><br /><br /> In this book, Robert Gilpin argues that American power had been essential for establishing these institutions, and waning American support threatened the basis of postwar cooperation and the great prosperity of the period. For Gilpin, a great power such as the United States is essential to fostering international cooperation. Exploring the relationship between politics and economics first highlighted by Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and other thinkers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Gilpin demonstrated the close ties between politics and economics in international relations, outlining the key role played by the creative use of power in the support of an institutional framework that created a world economy.<br /><br /><br /> Gilpin's exposition of the in.uence of politics on the international economy was a model of clarity, making the book the centerpiece of many courses in international political economy. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, when American support for international cooperation is once again in question, Gilpin's warnings about the risks of American unilateralism sound ever clearer.",

    "description": "In his major bestseller, <i>Race Matters</i>, philosopher Cornel West burst onto the national scene with his searing analysis of the scars of racism in American democracy. <i>Race Matters</i> has become a contemporary classic, still in print after ten years, having sold more than four hundred thousand copies. A mesmerizing speaker with a host of fervidly devoted fans, West gives as many as one hundred public lectures a year and appears regularly on radio and television. Praised by <i>The New York Times</i> for his \"ferocious moral vision\" and hailed by Newsweek as \"an elegant prophet with attitude,\" he bridges the gap between black and white opinion about the country's problems. <br /><br /> In <i>Democracy Matters</i>, West returns to the analysis of the arrested development of democracy-both in America and in the crisis-ridden Middle East. In a strikingly original diagnosis, he argues that if America is to become a better steward of democratization around the world, we must first wake up to the long history of imperialist corruption that has plagued our own democracy. Both our failure to foster peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the crisis of Islamist anti-Americanism stem largely from hypocrisies in our dealings with the world. Racism and imperial expansionism have gone hand in hand in our country's inexorable drive toward hegemony, and our current militarism is only the latest expression of that drive. Even as we are shocked by Islamic fundamentalism, our own brand of fundamentalism, which West dubs Constantinian Christianity, has joined forces with imperialist corporate and political elites in an unholy alliance, and four decades after the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., insidious racism still inflicts debilitating psychic pain on so many of our citizens. <br /><br /> But there is a deep democratic tradition in America of impassioned commitment to the fight against imperialist corruptions-the last great expression of which was the civil rights movement led by Dr. King-and West brings forth the powerful voices of that great democratizing tradition in a brilliant and deeply moving call for the revival of our better democratic nature. His impassioned and provocative argument for the revitalization of America's democracy will reshape the terms of the raging national debate about America's role in today's troubled world.",

Some are the recipients of numerous awards, while others, who are making their first appearance, are quickly making significant contributions to twenty-first-century poetry.<br /><br />The poets include Rick Barot, Joshua Beckman, David Berman, Nick Flynn, Matthea Harvey, Terrance Hayes, Major Jackson, James Kimbrell, D.A. Powell, Spencer Reece, Matthew Rohrer, Rebecca Wolff, Kevin Young, Matthew Zapruder, Andrew Zawacki, and many others.",

    "description": "Recognizing the current demands of the workplace, this applications-oriented introduction offers an easy-to-understand explanation of the principles of power electronics, with complete coverage on the switching, control and conversion of electrical power using semiconductor devices. Reflecting the increasing demand for efficient conversion and control of electrical power, it considers the latest power devices, circuits, and control schemes that continue to extend power electronics technology to new applications areas. Presents material methodically - first establishing the background theory before going on to specific applications. Familiarizes readers with the analysis and operation of various power conversions circuits that have applications at high power levels, and formulates equations that govern the behavior of these circuits. Discusses the application of power electronic devices in uncontrolled and controlled single phase rectifiers, inverters, ac voltage controllers, cycloconverters, and dc choppers, and demonstrates voltage and current waveform analysis for the output, starting with a simple resistive load to more practical inductive loads. Includes many worked examples, basic formulas, and an abundance of illustrations and diagrams.",

    "description": "My name is Meredith 'Merry' Gentry, but of course it's not my real name. I dare not even whisper my true name after dark for fear that one hushed word will travel over the night winds to the soft ear of my aunt, the Queen of Air and Darkness. She wants me dead. I don't even know why...<br /><br />I fled the high court of Faerie three years ago and have been in hiding ever since. As Merry Gentry, I am a private investigator for the Grey Detective Agency: Supernatural Problems, Magical Solutions. My magical skills, scorned at the courts of Faerie, are valued in the human world. Even by human standards, my magic isn't flashy, which is fine by me. Flashy attracts attention and I can't afford that.<br /><br />Rumour has it that I am dead. Not quite. I am Princess Meredith NicEssus. To speak that name after dark is to call down a knock upon your door from a hand that can kill you with a touch. I have been careful, but not careful enough. The shadows have found me, and they are going to take me back home, one way or another.<br /><br />So the running is over. But the fighting has just begun...<br /><br />Rich, sensual, brimming with dangerous magic, A Kiss of Shadows is a dazzling tour-de-force where folklore, fantasy and erotically charged adventure collide.",

    "description": "In this extraordinary work Gilles Deleuze, the most renowned living philosopher in France, reflects on one of the figures of the past who has most influenced his own sweeping reconfiguration of the tasks of philosophy. Deleuze's brilliant text shows how current definitions of philosophy do not apply to Spinoza: a solitary thinker (yet scandalous and hated), he conceived of philosophy as an enterprise of liberation and radical demystification much as did Leibniz or, later Nietzsche. Spinoza confronts the grand philosophical problems that are still current today: the comparative role of ontology (the theory of substance), of epistemology (the theory of ideas), and of political anthropology (the theory of modes, passions, and actions). The goal of this book is to determine the rapport among the univocity of Being in the theory of substance; the production of truth and the genesis of sense in the theory of ideas; and practical joy (or the elimination of the sad passions) and the selective organization of the passions in the theory of modes.",

    "description": "The work of a lifetime, from one of the world's most influential thinkers, about the heart of the Christian faith. \"I could never myself believe in God, if it were not for the cross. . . . In the real world of pain, how could one worship a God who was immune to it?\" With compelling honesty John Stott confronts this generation with the centrality of the cross in God's redemption of the world -- a world now haunted by the memories of Auschwitz, the pain of oppression and the specter of nuclear war. Can we see triumph in tragedy, victory in shame? Why should an object of Roman distaste and Jewish disgust be the emblem of our worship and the axiom of our faith? And what does it mean for us today? Now from one of the foremost preachers and Christian leaders of our day comes theology at its readable best, a contemporary restatement of the meaning of the cross. At the cross Stott finds the majesty and love of God disclosed, the sin and bondage of the world exposed. More than a study of the atonement, this book brings Scripture into living dialogue with Christian theology and the twentieth century. What emerges is a pattern for Christian life and worship, hope and mission. Destined to be a classic study of the center of our faith, Stott's work is the product of a uniquely gifted pastor, scholar and Christian statesman. His penetrating insight, charitable scholarship and pastoral warmth are guaranteed to feed both heart and mind.",

But nowhere is truly safe -- not from long-buried secrets, or murder....When the nude body of prep school student Kate Townsend is found near the Mississippi River, Penn's best friend, Drew Elliott, is desperate for his counsel. An esteemed family physician, Drew makes a shocking confession that could put him on death row. Penn will do all he can to exonerate Drew, but in a town where the gaze of a landmark cemetery statue -- the Turning Angel -- never looks away, Penn finds himself caught on the jagged edge of blackmail, betrayal, and deadly violence.",

          "description": "Penn Cage is a former prosecutor and Mayor of Natchez, Mississippi. The Penn Cage series \u201cinvolves all the quintessentially Southern themes\u2014family, racial violence, \u2018miscegenation,\u2019 honor, hypocrisy, and the quest for justice in an unfair society\u2026\u201d--\n    \n    A chronological order is not necessary, but certain books are linked by common characters or themes, and they do have a sequence in time.\n    \n    Of my \u201cNatchez\u201d or \u201cMississippi\u201d novels, the \u201cPenn Cage\u201d novels are a subcategory. I\u2019ve tried not to write a series character, for reasons I\u2019ll discuss elsewhere, but Penn has cropped up as a minor character in other Natchez books, and seems to be developing a life of his own. Of the rest, Mortal Fear, Dead Sleep, 24 Hours, and Sleep No More \u2014 while all set in Mississippi (or New Orleans)--- stand completely alone and can be read at any point.\n    \n    If you have just read Turning Angel, you should next read The Quiet Game, the novel in which Penn Cage first appeared, and which many readers believe is my best book. Blood Memory was written before Turning Angel, and Penn\u2019s father Tom Cage appears there in a supporting role, but I would read \u201cBlood Memory\u201d after \u201cThe Quiet Game,\u201d not before. You will appreciate Tom much more then.",

The book brings together all the elements that have brought Leonard Cohen\u2019s artistry with language worldwide recognition.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

From his Deep Image-inspired lyrics to his Whtimanesque renderings of Neruda, Vallejo, and other Latin American poets, and from his heartfelt reflections on life, love, and loss in his native Ohio to the celebrated prose poems (set frequently in Italy) that marked the end of his important career, <i>Above the River</i> gathers the complete work of a modern master. It also features a moving and insightful introduction by Donald Hall, Wright's longtime friend and colleague.",

And so the doughty young Labrador retriever, the roguish bull terrier and the indomitable Siamese set out through the Canadian wilderness. Separately, they would soon have died. But, together, the three house pets faced starvation, exposure, and wild forest animals to make their way home to the family they love. <i>The Incredible Journey</i> is one of the great children's stories of all time--and has been popular ever since its debut in 1961.",

    "description": "The only work of its kind to survive from classical antiquity, the <b>Library of Apollodorus</b> is a unique guide to Greek mythology, from the origins of the universe to the Trojan War. Apollodorus' <b>Library</b> has been used as a source book by classicists from the time of its compilation in the 1st-2nd century AD to the present, influencing writers from antiquity to Robert Graves. It provides a complete history of Greek myth, telling the story of each of the great families of heroic mythology, and the various adventures associated with the main heroes and heroines, from Jason and Perseus to Heracles and Helen of Troy. As a primary source for Greek myth, as a reference work, and as an indication of how the Greeks themselves viewed their mythical traditions, the <b>Library</b> is indispensable to anyone who has an interest in classical mythology. Robin Hard's accessible and fluent translation is supplemented by comprehensive notes, a map and full genealogical tables. The introduction gives a detailed account of the <b>Library's</b> sources and situates it within the fascinating narrative traditions of Greek mythology.",
