    "description": "In 2003, Susan Nathan moved from her comfortable home in Tel Aviv to Tamra, an Arab town in the northern part of Israel. Nathan had arrived in Israel four years earlier and had taught English and worked with various progressive social organizations. Her desire to help build a just and humane society in Israel took an unexpected turn, however, when she became aware of Israel\u2019s neglected and often oppressed indigenous Arab population. Despite warnings from friends about the dangers she would encounter, Nathan settled in an apartment in Tamra, the only Jew among 25,000 Muslims. There she discovered a division between Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs as tangible as the concrete wall and razor-wire fences that surround the Palestinian towns of the West Bank and Gaza. <br /><br />From her unique vantage point, Nathan examines the history and the present-day political and cultural currents that have created a situation little recognized in the ongoing debates about the future of Israel and the Middle East. With warmth, humor, and compassion, she portrays the daily life of her neighbors, the challenges they encounter, and the hopes they harbor. She introduces Arab leaders fighting against entrenched segregation and discrimination; uncovers the hidden biases that undermine even the most well-intentioned Arab-Jewish peace organizations; and describes the efforts of dedicated individuals who insist that Israeli Arabs must be granted the same rights and privileges as Jewish citizens. <br /><br />Through her own courageous example, Nathan proves that it is possible for Jews and Arabs to live and work peacefully together. <i>The Other Side of Israel</i> is more than the story of one woman\u2019s journey; it is a road map for crossing a divide created by prejudices and misunderstandings.",

    "description": "Ten-year-old Comfort Snowberger has attended 247 funerals. But that's not surprising, considering that her family runs the town funeral home. And even though Great-uncle Edisto keeled over with a heart attack and Great-great-aunt Florentine dropped dead--just like that--six months later, Comfort knows how to deal with loss, or so she thinks. She's more concerned with avoiding her crazy cousin Peach and trying to figure out why her best friend, Declaration, suddenly won't talk to her. Life is full of surprises. And the biggest one of all is learning what it takes to handle them.<br /><br />Deborah Wiles has created a unique, funny, and utterly real cast of characters in this heartfelt, and quintessentially Southern coming-of-age novel. Comfort will charm young readers with her wit, her warmth, and her struggles as she learns about life, loss, and ultimately, triumph.<br />",

    "description": "In the shadow of Auschwitz, a flamboyant German industrialist grew into a living legend to the Jews of Cracow. He was a womaniser, a heavy drinker and a bon viveur, but to them he became a saviour. This is the extraordinary story of Oskar Schindler, who risked his life to protect Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland and who was transformed by the war into a man with a mission, a compassionate angel of mercy.",

    "description": "<div>\n  <p>In the first part of Foakes's introduction, the editor examines <i>King Lear</i> as it is read in the mind versus how it is performed on the stage, analyzing historical productions and certain elements of the play that shine in performance but not in text, and vice versa. This section also explores how and why the play has invited so many interpretations, in reading and performance, since its inception. The next part of the introduction considers trends in the criticism and staging of the play, such as the recent shift of favor from redemptive to bleak readings. Foakes then addresses the dating of the play, the differences among the Quarto and Folio texts, and whether these changes are mere discrepancies or intentional revisions. Finally, the editor discusses the casting of the play and explains notable usages in his edition. There are two appendices that follow the play: the first examines two textual problems that are particularly difficult to interpret, and the second explains differences in lineation between the Quarto and Folio editions, which resulted from confusion whether certain lines were in prose or verse. This edition also includes lists of illustrations, abbreviations, and references, as well as a general editors' preface and an index.<br /><br /><b>The Arden Shakespeare</b> has developed a reputation as the pre-eminent critical edition of Shakespeare for its exceptional scholarship, reflected in the thoroughness of each volume. An introduction comprehensively contextualizes the play, chronicling the history and culture that surrounded and influenced Shakespeare at the time of its writing and performance, and closely surveying critical approaches to the work. Detailed appendices address problems like dating and casting, and analyze the differing Quarto and Folio sources. A full commentary by one or more of the play's foremost contemporary scholars illuminates the text, glossing unfamiliar terms and drawing from an abundance of research and expertise to explain allusions and significant background information. Highly informative and accessible, Arden offers the fullest experience of Shakespeare available to a reader.</p>\n</div>",

    "description": "Amanda Eyre Ward's debut novel is an intimate portrait of three women whose lives collide during a brutal Texas summer.<br /><br />In Gatestown, Texas, twenty-nine-year-old Karen Lowens awaits her execution with a host of convicted serial killers on death row. In Manhattan, Dr. Franny Wren, also twenty-nine, tends to a young cancer patient, and resists the urge to run from her fianc\u00e9 and her carefully crafted life. In Austin, Texas, brassy Celia Mills, a once-vibrant librarian, mourns her murdered husband.<br /><br />Over the course of the summer, fate pushes these eerily recognizable women together, culminating in a revelation of the possibility of faith, the responsibility of friendship, and the value of life. <em>Sleep Toward Heaven</em> is a luminous story of murder and desire, solitude and grace -- a rare literary page-turner where redemption seems perpetually within arm's reach.",

Soon after her untimely death in 1965, Jackson\u2019s children discovered a treasure trove of previously unpublished and uncollected stories, many of which are brought together in this remarkable collection. Here are tales of torment, psychological aberration, and the macabre, as well as those that display her lighter touch with humorous scenes of domestic life. Reflecting the range and complexity of Jackson\u2019s talent, <i>Just an Ordinary Day</i> reaffirms her enduring influence and celebrates her singular voice, rich with magic and resonance.<br /> \u00a0<br /><b>Praise for <i>Just an Ordinary Day</i></b><br /><b>\n  <i>\u00a0</i>\n</b><br /> \u201cJackson at her best: plumbing the extraordinary from the depths of mid-twentieth-century common.

    "description": "<b>Now that all the others have run out of air, it\u2019s my turn to do a little story-making.</b> <p>In Homer\u2019s account in <i>The Odyssey</i>, Penelope\u2014wife of Odysseus and cousin of the beautiful Helen of Troy\u2014is portrayed as the quintessential faithful wife, her story a salutary lesson through the ages. Left alone for twenty years when Odysseus goes off to fight in the Trojan War after the abduction of Helen, Penelope manages, in the face of scandalous rumors, to maintain the kingdom of Ithaca, bring up her wayward son, and keep over a hundred suitors at bay, simultaneously. When Odysseus finally comes home after enduring hardships, overcoming monsters, and sleeping with goddesses, he kills her suitors and\u2014curiously\u2014twelve of her maids.</p> <p>In a splendid contemporary twist to the ancient story, Margaret Atwood has chosen to give the telling of it to Penelope and to her twelve hanged maids, asking: \u201cWhat led to the hanging of the maids, and what was Penelope <i>really</i> up to?\u201d In Atwood\u2019s dazzling, playful retelling, the story becomes as wise and compassionate as it is haunting, and as wildly entertaining as it is disturbing. With wit and verve, drawing on the story-telling and poetic talent for which she herself is renowned, she gives Penelope new life and reality\u2014and sets out to provide an answer to an ancient mystery.</p>",

Soon a pitched battle breaks out over who will take power, involving, among others, the zealous reformer Dr Proudie, his fiendish wife and the unctuous schemer Obadiah Slope. <br /><br /><i>Barchester Towers</i> is one of the best-loved novels in <i>Trollope's Chronicles of Barsetshire</i> series, which captured nineteenth-century provincial England with wit, worldly wisdom and an unparalleled gift for characterization. It is the second book in the <i>Chronicles of Barsetshire</i>.",

When Bee turns up dead, Ana is dispatched to the big city to clear out her apartment. Instantly seduced by the second-hand glamour of Bee's baubles, bangles and bottles of Pierre-Jouet, Ana takes up with Bee's wild club-hopping cronies.

Now Ana is on a mission to discover what really happened to Bee Bearhorn, the one-hit wonder--and what is about to happen to the unremarkable Ana Wills.",

    "description": "Here is a typical Stone Age family, reimagined by Roy Lewis in this hilarious novel as characters in some glittering drawing-room comedy. Father, who has a scientific turn of mind, has just discovered fire. Mother makes sure the children finish supper, even when the plat du jour is toad. Uncle Vanya thinks that the species has been flirting with disaster ever since it began to chip flint into tools. While little Alexander has gotten himself in deep trouble by making the first cave painting: artists are always so misunderstood.<br /><br />Long out of print, <i>The Evolution Man</i> would make Charles Darwin turn over in his grave. Lewis has written a witty, intelligent satire of the lives of our remote ancestors, complete with highly revisionist accounts of everything from the origins of courtship to the staples of Pleistocene cuisine. It's the funniest thing to happen to prehistory since Raquel Welch donned a fur bikini in <i>One Million B.C.</i>",

    "description": "A father must come to terms with his son's death in the war. In Venice an architecture student commits a crime of passion. A white southern airport loader tries to do a favor for a black northern child. The ordinary stuff of ordinary fiction--but with a difference! These tales take place twenty-five, fifty, a hundred-fifty years from now, when men and women have been given gills to labor under the sea. Huge repair stations patrol the cables carrying power to the ends of the earth. Telepathic and precocious children so passionately yearn to visit distant galaxies that they'll kill to go. Brilliantly crafted, beautifully written, these are Samuel Delany's award-winning stories, like no others before or since.<br /><br />Contents<br /><br />3 \u2022 The Star Pit \u2022 (1967) \u2022 novella by Samuel R.

    "description": "Published in 1984, <i>Not Wanted on the Voyage</i> is one of Timothy Findley's most imaginative and compelling literary fictions. Findley turns to one of our essential myths: the biblical story of the great Flood, but he doesn't so much retell it as take our common knowledge of the Old Testament tale and give it an extraordinary twist. Here we have Dr. Noah Noyes, diabolical conjuror and dictatorial leader of his helpless little boat-bound band, sure of his total superiority as man, husband, and father, imposing his view of the ways of God on his wife and family. The kind and generous Mrs. Noyes stands in direct contrast to her hard-hearted husband, and then there are the Noyes children: strongman Japeth, every inch his father's son, with his delicate wife, Emma; and the sensitive Ham, every inch his mother's, with his mysterious wife, Lucy (a.k.a. Lucifer, who, having escaped from Hell, has decided to align himself with mankind). Findley, a great lover of cats, also gives us the crotchety Mottyl, making her way through her ninth and final life. <i>Not Wanted on the Voyage</i> is poetic and passionate and bursting with a wide-eyed inventiveness, at once a stunningly contemporary attempt at mythmaking, a grand novel of the power of the imagination, and a thoroughly good read. <i>--Jeffrey Canton</i>",

    "description": "The <i>T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge</i>, centre-piece of the eighth-century Ulster cycle of heroic tales, is Ireland's nearest approach to a great epic. It tells the story of a great cattle-raid, the invasion of Ulster by the armies of Medb and Ailill, queen and king of Connacht, and their allies, seeking to carry off the great Brown Bull of C\u00faailnge. The hero of the tale is C\u00fachulainn, the Hound of Ulster, who resists the invaders single-handed, while Ulster's warriors lie sick.<br /><br />Thomas Kinsella's presents a complete and living version of the story. His translation is based on the partial texts in two medieval manuscripts, with elements from other version, and adds a group of related stories which prepare for the action of the <i>T\u00e1in</i>. <br /><br />Illustrated with brush drawings by Louis le Brocquy, this edition provides a combination of medieval epic and modern art.",

    "description": "<b>The delicious and erotically charged sequel to <i>The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty</i>, from the author of <i>Beauty's Kingdom</i>. </b><br /><br />This sequel to <i>The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty</i>, the first of Anne Rice's (writing as A.N. Roquelaure) elegantly written volumes of erotica, continues her explicit, teasing exploration of the psychology of human desire. Now Beauty, having indulged in a secret and forbidden infatuation with the rebellious slave Prince Tristan, is sent away from the Satyricon-like world of the Castle. Sold at auction, she will soon experience the tantalizing punishments of \"the village,\" as her education in love, cruelty, dominance, submission, and tenderness is turned over to the brazenly handsome Captain of the Guard. And once again Rice's fabulous tale of pleasure and pain dares to explore the most primal and well-hidden desires of the human heart. Preceding the visceral eroticism of E.L. James' <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> and Sylvia Day's <i>Bared to You</i><b>, </b> and even more haunting than her own novel <i>Belinda</i>, this second installment in the Sleeping Beauty series is not to be missed.",

    "description": "The Apollo lunar missions of the 1960s and 1970s have been called the last optimistic acts of the twentieth century. Twelve astronauts made this greatest of all journeys and were indelibly marked by it, for better or for worse. Journalist Andrew Smith tracks down the nine surviving members of this elite group to find their answers to the question \"Where do you go after you've been to the Moon?\"<br /><br />A thrilling blend of history, reportage, and memoir, <em>Moondust</em> rekindles the hopeful excitement of an incandescent hour in America's past and captures the bittersweet heroism of those who risked everything to hurl themselves out of the known world -- and who were never again quite able to accept its familiar bounds.",

    "description": "For fourteen years, critic Joe Queenan walked past the Winter Garden Theater in New York City without once even dreaming of venturing inside to see <em>Cats</em>. One fateful afternoon in March 1996, however, having grown weary of his hopelessly elitist lifestyle, he decided to buy a half-price ticket and check out Andrew Lloyd Webber's record-breaking juggernaut. No, he did not expect the musical to be any good, but surely there were limits to how bad it could be. Here, Queenan was tragically mistaken. <em>Cats</em>, what <em>Grease</em> would look like if all the cast members were dressed up like KISS, was infinitely more idiotic than he had ever imagined. Yet now the Rubicon had been crossed. Queenan had involuntarily launched himself on a harrowing personal oddyssey: an 18-month descent into the abyss of American popular culture. At first, Queenan found things to be every bit as atrocious as he expected. John Tesh defiling the temple of Carnegie Hall reminded him of Adolf Hitler goose-stepping in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. <em>The Celestine Prophecy</em> and <em>The Horse Whisperer</em> proved to be prodigiously cretinous. And the sight of senior citizens forking over their hard-earned nickels and dimes to watch Joe Pesci in <em>Gone Fishin'</em> so moved Queenan that he began standing outside the theater issuing refunds to exiting patrons. But then something strange happened. Queenan started enjoying Barry Manilow concerts. He went to see Julie Andrews and Liza Minnelli and Raquel Welch in <em>Victor/Victoria</em>. He said nice things about Larry King and Charles Grodin in his weekly <em>TV Guide</em> column. He spent hours planted in front of the television, transfixed by special, two-hour episodes of <em>Walker: Texas Ranger</em>. He actually ordered the dreaded <em>zuppa toscana</em> at the Olive Garden. Most frightening of all, he shook hands with Geraldo Rivera. How Queenan finally escaped from the cultural Hot Zone and returned to civilization is an epic tale as heart-warming, awe-inspiring, and life-affirming as <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>, <em>The Adventures of Marco Polo</em>, <em>Gulliver's Travels</em>, and <em>Swiss Family Robinson</em>. Well, almost.",

    "description": "From the bestselling author of <i>Red Lobster, White Trash and the Blue Lagoon</i> comes a vintage Queenan tirade chronicling the evolution of his own Baby Boomer Generation. How did a generation that started out at Woodstock and Monterey end up at Crate &amp; Barrel? How did a generation that promised to \"teach its children well\" end up with a progeny so evil they could give Damien from <i>The Omen </i>a run for his money? And what is so fascinating about porcini mushrooms? Professional iconoclast Queenan shows how a generation with so much promise lost its way by confusing pop culture with culture and mistaking lifestyle for life.<br /><br /><i>Queenan on The Sixties:</i> \"Baby Boomers who never saw Hendrix, did drugs, locked or loaded an AK-47 in country or bedded down with a girl named Radiance now all pretend they did. It's like those Civil War reenactment buffs who have drunk so much Wild Turkey they actually think they were at Chickamauga.\"<br /><br /><i>Queenan on Death</i>: \"A generation whose primary cultural artifact is the Filofax has enormous difficulty shoehorning death into its schedule: it's inconvenient, time-consuming and stressful. '<i>We don't have time to die this afternoon; Caitlin has ballet.</i>'\"",

    "description": "Brilliant, fast-paced, and highly suspenseful, Tenderwire tells the story of a reckless young musician and her obsession with a very old violin. <br /><br />Eva Tyne leaves her home in Ireland for New York to play in the New Amsterdam Chamber Orchestra. She collapses after her solo debut, checks herself out of the hospital prematurely, and embarks on a chaotic and dangerous odyssey. She falls in love with a mysterious man and becomes obsessed with a rare violin of dubious provenance, for which she must pay in cash. But consumed by obsession, her pursuit of the violin becomes a nightmare of paranoia: Haunted by the ghost of her father, racked with jealousy, and unsure whom she can trust, Eva is pitched into a desperate psychological conundrum as her desires threaten to destroy her.<br /><br />Narrated in Eva's unforgettable and unreliable voice, Tenderwire is a guessing game and a whodunit that surprises at every turn.<br />",

    "description": "Victorian dandy Lord Geoffroy Loveall is faced with a dilemma. As heir apparent to Love Hall, he must produce an heir of his own; but his obsessive love for his long-dead sister has rendered him a paralytic in matters of the heart. Adding to Geoffroy's troubles is his difficult mother, Lady Loveall, who mercilessly castigates her effeminate son, and a circling mob of greedy relatives anxious to wrest Love Hall from his grasp.<br /><br />Then, a miracle occurs. As his carriage passes a trash dump, Geoffroy spies an abandoned baby in the jaws of a cur. He saves the child, names her Rose, and declares her his rightful heir. The shock fells Lady Loveall on the spot, and Rose becomes the pampered daughter of Lord Loveall and his bride of convenience, the resident librarian Anonyma. This joyful period lasts until Rose's adolescence, when it becomes increasingly difficult to hide the one great secret of Love Hall: namely, that Rose, now in the position of fending off suitors for her titled hand, is in fact a boy. <br /><br />Rose's whiskers, deepening voice, and affection for the daughter of a courtier have not gone unnoticed. Armed with the new revelation, the Loveall's unscrupulous relatives launch a coup, and a desperately confused Rose is cast adrift -- until he finds the renewed vitality that comes from the love of true family and realizes that he can and must go home.",

I was born part precious metal, part pirate.\"), an orphaned girl who is taken in by blind Mr. Pew, the mysterious and miraculously old keeper of a lighthouse on the Scottish coast. Pew tells Silver stories of Babel Dark, a nineteenth-century clergyman. Dark lived two lives: a public one mired in darkness and deceit and a private one bathed in the light of passionate love. For Silver, Dark's life becomes a map through her own darkness, into her own story, and, finally, into love.<br /><br />One of the most original and extraordinary writers of her generation, Jeanette Winterson has created a modern fable about the transformative power of storytelling. <br /><br />",

    "description": "The silver-haired woman walked away from her name and vowed to \"remain a wanderer until mankind has learned the way of peace\". On New Year's Day, 1953, she walked ahead of the Tournament of Roses parade handing out peace messages. It was the beginning of a pilgrimage that would last eighteen years. Traveling on foot without money or possessions, with only the food and shelter offered by well-wishers, she carried her simple yet compelling message throughout the United States and Canada. After the first 25,000 miles she stopped counting.Peace Pilgrim's account of her journeys across America and her spiritual discoveries along the way continues to inspire growing numbers of readers worldwide.",

    "description": "<strong> Inspired by a landmark exhibition mounted by the British Museum in 1963 to celebrate five eventful centuries of the printed word, Nicholas A. Basbanes offers a lively consideration of writings that have \"made things happen\" in the world, works that have both nudged the course of history and fired the imagination of countless influential people. </strong><br /><br />In his fifth work to examine a specific aspect of book culture, Basbanes also asks what we can know about such figures as John Milton, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Adams, Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, Henry James, Thomas Edison, Helen Keller\u2013\u2013even the notorious Marquis de Sade and Adolf Hitler\u2013\u2013by knowing what they have read. He shows how books that many of these people have consulted, in some cases annotated with their marginal notes, can offer tantalizing clues to the evolution of their character and the development of their thought.<br /><br /><strong></strong>",

    "description": "<i>Last Orders</i> is the story of four men once close to London butcher Jack Dodds, who meet to carry out his last wish: to have his ashes scattered into the sea. The men, whose lives revolve around work, family, the racetrack and their favourite pub, must make their way down to a seaside town to complete the task. Through conversation and memory they trace the paths they have followed by choice and by accident; through the Second World War and its aftermath, through the dramas of family life, and their relationships with each other. In their brilliantly realized, richly nuanced voices, Swift has created a narrative language that perfectly expresses not only the comforts of old habits and friendships, but also the complexity and courage of ordinary lives.",

    "description": "Jack Mullen is a driven student of the law. His brother Peter is a servant of the rich, parking the cars of the Hamptons' elite --- and perhaps satisfying their more intimate needs as well. Then Peter's body is found on the beach. Jack knows the drowning was no accident, but someone's unlimited power and money have bought the cops, the judges, the system. Now Jack is learning a lesson in justice he never got in law school ... and his astonishing plan to beat the billionaires will have you reeling --- and cheering --- to the very last page.",

    "description": "A classic handbook for anyone who needs to write, Writing With Power speaks to everyone who has wrestled with words while seeking to gain power with them. Here, Peter Elbow emphasizes that the essential activities underlying good writing and the essential exercises promoting it are really not difficult at all. Employing a cookbook approach, Elbow provides the reader (and writer) with various recipes: for getting words down on paper, for revising, for dealing with an audience, for getting feedback on a piece of writing, and still other recipes for approaching the mystery of power in writing. In a new introduction, he offers his reflections on the original edition, discusses the responses from people who have followed his techniques, how his methods may differ from other processes, and how his original topics are still pertinent to todays writer. By taking risks and embracing mistakes, Elbow hopes the writer may somehow find a hold on the creative process and be able to heighten two mentalities--the production of writing and the revision of it. From students and teachers to novelists and poets, Writing with Power reminds us that we can celebrate the uses of mystery, chaos, nonplanning, and magic, while achieving analysis, conscious control, explicitness, and care in whatever it is we set down on paper.",

    "description": "On an evening in late summer, the great financier Harry Wainwright, nearing the end of his life, arrives at a rustic fishing camp in a remote area of Maine. He comes bearing two things: his wish for a day of fishing in a place that has brought him solace for thirty years, and an astonishing bequest that will forever change the lives of those around him.<br /><br />From the battlefields of Italy to the turbulence of the Vietnam era, to the private battles of love and family, The Summer Guest reveals the full history of this final pilgrimage and its meaning for four people: Jordan Patterson, the haunted young man who will guide Harry on his last voyage out; the camp\u2019s owner Joe Crosby, a Vietnam draft evader who has spent a lifetime \u201ctrying to learn what it means to be brave\u201d; Joe\u2019s wife, Lucy, the woman Harry has loved for three decades; and Joe and Lucy\u2019s daughter Kate\u2014the spirited young woman who holds the key to the last unopened door to the past.<br /><br />As their stories unfold, secrets are revealed, courage is tested, and the bonds of love are strengthened. And always center stage is the place itself\u2014a magical, forgotten corner of New England where the longings of the human heart are mirrored in the wild beauty of the landscape.",

Bill, aging and sick but still able to best any man in a fair gunfight, just wants to be left alone to drink and play cards. But in this town of played-out miners, bounty hunters, upstairs girls, Chinese immigrants, and various other entrepeneurs and miscreants, he finds himself pursued by a vicious sheriff, a perverse whore man bent on revenge, and a besotted Calamity Jane. Fueled by liquor, sex, and violence, this is the real wild west, unlike anything portrayed in the dime novels that first told its story.",

    "description": "One of the world's leading historians of Renaissance Italy brings to life here the vibrant--and violent--society of fifteenth-century Florence. His disturbing narrative opens up an entire culture, revealing the dark side of Renaissance man and politician Lorenzo de' Medici.<br /><br />On a Sunday in April 1478, assassins attacked Lorenzo and his brother as they attended Mass in the cathedral of Florence. Lorenzo scrambled to safety as Giuliano bled to death on the cathedral floor. <em>April Blood</em> moves outward in time and space from that murderous event, unfolding a story of tangled passions, ambition, treachery, and revenge. The conspiracy was led by one of the city's most noble clans, the Pazzi, financiers who feared and resented the Medici's swaggering new role as political bosses--but the web of intrigue spread through all of Italy. Bankers, mercenaries, the Duke of Urbino, the King of Naples, and Pope Sixtus IV entered secretly into the plot. Florence was plunged into a peninsular war, and Lorenzo was soon fighting for his own and his family's survival.<br /><br />The failed assassination doomed the Pazzi. Medici revenge was swift and brutal--plotters were hanged or beheaded, innocents were hacked to pieces, and bodies were put out to dangle from the windows of the government palace. All remaining members of the larger Pazzi clan were forced to change their surname, and every public sign or symbol of the family was expunged or destroyed.<br /><br /><em>April Blood</em> offers us a fresh portrait of Renaissance Florence, where dazzling artistic achievements went side by side with violence, craft, and bare-knuckle politics. At the center of the canvas is the figure of Lorenzo the Magnificent--poet, statesman, connoisseur, patron of the arts, and ruthless \"boss of bosses.\" This extraordinarily vivid account of a turning point in the Italian Renaissance is bound to become a lasting work of history.<br />",

This is a modern story of...<br /><br />COUNTING COUP<br /><br />In this extraordinary work of journalism, Larry Colton journeys into the world of Montana's Crow Indians and follows the struggles of a talented, moody, charismatic young woman named Sharon LaForge, a gifted basketball player and a descendant of one of George Armstrong Custer's Indian scouts. But \"Counting Coup\" is far more than just a sports story or a portrait of youth. It is a sobering expos\u00e9 of a part of our society long since cut out of the American dream.<br /><br />Along the banks of the Little Big Horn, Indians and whites live in age-old conflict and young Indians grow up without role models or dreams. Here Sharon carries the hopes and frustrations of her people on her shoulders as she battles her opponents on and off the court. Colton delves into Sharon's life and shows us the realities of the reservation, the shattered families, the bitter tribal politics, and a people's struggle against a belief that all their children -- even the most intelligent and talented -- are destined for heartbreak. Against this backdrop stands Sharon, a fiery, undaunted competitor with the skill to dominate a high school game and earn a college scholarship. Yet getting to college seems beyond Sharon's vision, obscured by the daily challenge of getting through the season -- physically and ps",

    "description": "Mary and O\u2019Neil frequently marveled at how, of all the lives they might have led, they had somehow found this one together. When they met at the Philadelphia high school where they\u2019d come to teach, each had suffered a profound loss that had not healed. How likely was it that they could learn to trust, much less love, again?<br /><br />Justin Cronin\u2019s poignant debut traces the lives of Mary Olson and O\u2019Neil Burke, two vulnerable young teachers who rediscover in each other a world alive with promise and hope. From the formative experiences of their early adulthood to marriage, parenthood, and beyond, this novel in stories illuminates the moments of grace that enable Mary and O\u2019Neil to make peace with the deep emotional legacies that haunt them: the sudden, mysterious death of O\u2019Neil\u2019s parents, Mary\u2019s long-ago decision to end a pregnancy, O\u2019Neil\u2019s sister\u2019s battle with illness and a troubled marriage. Alive with magical nuance and unexpected encounters, Mary and O\u2019Neil celebrates the uncommon in common lives, and the redemptive power of love.",

Novela de hondo perfil humano, Eva Luna funde el destino individual con el colectivo mediante una fulgurante prosa de car\u00e1cter \u00e9pico. Sin duda, una de las mejores obras de la literatura latinoamericana de los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os.",

    "description": "Acclaimed cultural critic bell hooks offers an open-hearted and welcoming vision of gender, sexuality, and society in this inspiring and accessible volume. In engaging and provocative style, bell hooks introduces a popular theory of feminism rooted in common sense and the wisdom of experience. Hers is a vision of a beloved community that appeals to all those committed to equality, mutual respect, and justice. hooks applies her critical analysis to the most contentious and challenging issues facing feminists today, including reproductive rights, violence, race, class, and work. With her customary insight and unsparing honesty, hooks calls for a feminism free from barriers but rich with rigorous debate. In language both eye-opening and optimistic, hooks encourages us to demand alternatives to patriarchal, racist, and homophobic culture, and to imagine a different future.",

    "description": "The accused was a slight, frightened man who had deliberately broken the law. His trial was a Roman circus. The chief gladiators were two great legal giants of the century. Like two bull elephants locked in mortal combat, they bellowed and roared imprecations and abuse. The spectators sat uneasily in the sweltering heat with murder in their hearts, barely able to restrain themselves. At stake was the freedom of every American. One of the most moving and meaningful plays of our generation. \"a tidal wave of a drama.\" -- \"New York World-Telegram And Sun\"",

    "description": "In the declining years of the British Empire, in Northern Rhodesia, Stewart Gore-Browne was a proper English gentleman who built himself a sprawling country estate, complete with liveried servants, rose gardens, and lavish dinners finished off with vintage port in the library. All that was missing was a woman to share it with. He adored the beautiful aviatrix Ethel Locke King, but she was almost twenty years his senior, married, and his aunt. Lorna, the only other woman Gore-Brown cared for, was married as well, but years later her orphaned daughter would become Gore-Browne's wife. The story of a colonialist who beat his servants yet supported Rhodesian independence and who was given a chief's burial by the local elders when he died, <em>The Africa House</em> rescues \"from oblivion the life story of an astonishing man, an astonishing marriage, and an astonishing house\" (<em>The Spectator</em>).",

    "description": "The only novel from Alice Munro -- award-winning author of <i>The Love of a Good Woman</i> -- is an insightful, honest book, \"autobiographical in form but not in fact,\" that chronicles a young girl's growing up in rural Ontario in the 1940s.<br /><br />Del Jordan lives out at the end of the Flats Road on her father's fox farm, where her most frequent companions are an eccentric bachelor family friend and her rough younger brother. When she begins spending more time in town, she is surrounded by women -- her mother, an agnostic, opinionated woman who sells encyclopedias to local farmers; her mother's boarder, the lusty Fern Dogherty; and her best friend, Naomi, with whom she shares the frustrations and unbridled glee of adolescence.<br /><br />Through these unwitting mentors and in her own encounters with sex, birth, and death, Del explores the dark and bright sides of womanhood. All along she remains a wise, witty observer and recorder of truths in small-town life. The result is a powerful, moving, and humorous demonstration of Alice Munro's unparalleled awareness of the lives of girls and women.",

Despite these disturbing numbers, little is known about life inside beyond the mythology of popular culture.<br /><br />Michael G. Santos, a federal prisoner nearing the end of his second decade of continuous confinement, has dedicated the last\u00a0eighteen years to shedding light on the lives of the men warehoused in the American prison system. <i>Inside:</i> <i>Life Behind Bars in America</i>, his first book for the general public, takes us behind those bars and into the chaos of the cellblock. <br />\u00a0<br />Capturing the voices of his fellow prisoners with perfect pitch, Santos makes the tragic--- and at times inspiring---stories of men from the toughest gang leaders to the richest Wall Street criminals come alive. From drug schemes, murders for hire, and even a prostitution ring that trades on the flesh of female prison guards, this book contains the never-before-seen details of prison life that at last illuminate the varied ways in which men experience life behind bars in America.",

    "description": "<b>War cartoonist Joe Sacco visits the Bosnian conflict to uncover the stories that are often ignored or uncovered by traditional media.</b><br /><br />How does an artist reconcile being forced to go to the front line of a brutal conflict that will change his life and homeland forever? What happens when a reporter finally comes face-to-face with an evil war criminal? Before his groundbreaking graphic novels <i>Safe Area Gorazde</i> and<i> The Fixer</i>, Palestinian author Joe Sacco created two short stories with characters from each side of the crossfire. Collected for the first time in <i>War's End: Profiles from Bosnia 1995\u20131996</i> are the acclaimed <i>Soba</i> and <i>Christmas with Karadzic</i>. In<i> Soba</i>, Sacco captures the internal torment of the romanticized Sarajevo artist-warrior who captivated the Western media with his guitar and hard-partying ways. In <i>Christmas with Karadzic</i>, Sacco gives the reader an inside peek at the darkly humorous news process that doesn't make the headlines back home as he chases after one of the most hated and sought-after Bosnian Serb leaders and war criminals.",

    "description": "<i>The Guru Papers</i> demonstrates with uncompromising clarity that authoritarian control, which once held societies together, is now at the core of personal, social, and planetary problems, and thus a key factor in social disintegration. It illustrates how authoritarianism is embedded in the way people think, hiding in culture, values, daily life, and in the very morality people try to live by. The book unmasks authoritarianism in such areas as relationships, cults, 12-step groups, religion, and contemporary morality. Chapters on addiction and love show the insidious nature of authoritarian values and ideologies in the most intimate corners of life, offering new frameworks for understanding why people get addicted and why intimacy is laden with conflict. By exposing the inner authoritarian that people use to control themselves and others, the authors show why people give up their power, and how others get and maintain it.",

Preserving everything he published in his lifetime, the new <i>Collected Poems</i> is an indispensable contribution to the legacy of an icon of twentieth-century poetry.",

    "description": "From the bestselling author of <i>The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry</i> and <i>So You've Been Publicly Shamed</i>.<br /><br />In 1979 a secret unit was established by the most gifted minds within the U.S. Army. Defying all known accepted military practice -- and indeed, the laws of physics -- they believed that a soldier could adopt a cloak of invisibility, pass cleanly through walls, and, perhaps most chillingly, kill goats just by staring at them.<br /><br /> Entrusted with defending America from all known adversaries, they were the First Earth Battalion. And they really weren't joking. What's more, they're back and fighting the War on Terror.<br /><br /> With firsthand access to the leading players in the story, Ronson traces the evolution of these bizarre activities over the past three decades and shows how they are alive today within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and in postwar Iraq. Why are they blasting Iraqi prisoners of war with the theme tune to Barney the Purple Dinosaur? Why have 100 debleated goats been secretly placed inside the Special Forces Command Center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina? How was the U.S. military associated with the mysterious mass suicide of a strange cult from San Diego? <i>The Men Who Stare at Goats</i> answers these and many more questions.",

    "description": "Nurdin Lalani and his family, Asian immigrants from Africa, have come to the Toronto suburb of Don Mills only to find that the old world and its values pursue them. A genial orderly at a downtown hospital, he has been accused of sexually assaulting a girl. Although he is innocent, traditional propriety prompts him to question the purity of his own thoughts. Ultimately, his friendship with the enlightened Sushila offers him an alluring freedom from a past that haunts him, a marriage that has become routine, and from the trials of coping with teenage children. Introducing us to a cast of vividly drawn characters within this immigrant community, Vassanji is a keen observer of lives caught between one world and another.",

    "description": "How did the universe begin and how will it end?<br /> What is matter?<br /> What is mind, and can it survive death?<br /> What are time and space, and how do they relate to ideas about God?<br /> Is the order of the universe the result of accident or design? <br /> The most profound and age-old questions of existence -- for centuries the focus of religion and philosophy -- may soon be answered through the extraordinary advances of a field of science known as the new physics. In this illuminating work, Paul Davies, author of the acclaimed <i>Other Worlds</i> and <i>The Edge of Infinity,</i> writes that the discoveries of 20th-century physics -- relativity and the quantum theory -- are now pointing the way to a new appreciation of man and his place in the universe. They could, in fact, bring within our grasp a unified description of all creation. Demanding a radical reformulation of the most fundamental aspects of reality and a way of thinking that is in closer accord with mysticism than materialism, the new physics, says Davies, offers a surer path to God than religion. <br /> Described by <i>The Washington Post</i> as \"impressive,\" <i>God and the New Physics</i> is a fascinating look at the impact of science on what were formerly religious issues. Elegantly written, a book for both scholars and lay readers of science, it is, according to the <i>Christian Science Monitor,</i> a \"provocative...rewarding intellectual romp.\"",

    "description": "Off the coast of Nova Scotia in 1952, fierce winds force a small boat into port. The boat's pilot, the eccentric Captain Charles Johnson, takes up residence at the small inn run by Jim and his mother. With each day, the captain's presence becomes more valuable to the family as they struggle to keep the inn open for business\u2014and his background becomes more mysterious as Jim discovers how much he knows about the lives and battles of the old-time pirates. <br /><br /> Who is this man whose compelling stories bring to life in such detail the day-to-day experience of sailing on a pirate ship? And how can he possibly know so much about how it feels to grow up among the Vikings; about how Francis Drake and Queen Elizabeth plotted their victories; about the loves of Grace O'Malley, the pirate queen of Ireland?",

    "description": "<b>Controversial indictment of those who exploit the tragedy of the Holocaust for their own gain.</b><br /><br />In an iconoclastic and controversial study, Norman G. Finkelstein moves from an interrogation of the place the Holocaust has come to occupy in American culture to a disturbing examination of recent Holocaust compensation agreements. It was not until the Arab-Israeli War of 1967, when Israel's evident strength brought it into line with US foreign policy, that memory of the Holocaust began to acquire the exceptional prominence it enjoys today. Leaders of America's Jewish community were delighted that Israel was now deemed a major strategic asset and, Finkelstein contends, exploited the Holocaust to enhance this newfound status. Their subsequent interpretations of the tragedy are often at variance with actual historical events and are employed to deflect any criticism of Israel and its supporters. Recalling Holocaust fraudsters such as Jerzy Kosinski and Binjamin Wilkomirski, as well as the demagogic constructions of writers like Daniel Goldhagen, Finkelstein contends that the main danger posed to the memory of Nazism's victims comes not from the distortions of Holocaust deniers but from prominent, self-proclaimed guardians of Holocaust memory. Drawing on a wealth of untapped sources, he exposes the double shakedown of European countries as well as legitimate Jewish claimants, and concludes that the Holocaust industry has become an outright extortion racket. Thoroughly researched and closely argued, The Holocaust Industry is all the more disturbing and powerful because the issues it deals with are so rarely discussed.<br /><br />In a devastating new postscript to this best-selling book, Norman G. Finkelstein documents the Holocaust industry's scandalous cover-up of the blackmail of Swiss banks, and in a new appendix demolishes an influential apologia for the Holocaust industry.",

    "description": "When John Cave, a mortician by trade, appears on television to declare that death is infinitely preferable to life, he sparks a religious movement that quickly leaves Christianity and most of Islam in the dust. Aided by a relentless public-relations campaign and supported by a \"theology\" whipped into existence by a historian besotted with love for one of Cave's alluring disciples, Cave's message proves irresistible. Things really start to get out of hand, however, when the notion of \"voluntary death\" creeps into the doctrine and the world's population is invited to depart from life in \"pleasant establishments\". A deft and daring blend of satire and prophecy first published in 1954, Messiah eerily anticipates the excesses of Jim Jones, David Koresh, and \"Do\", the guru of Heaven's Gate.",

    "description": "Artist-writer-director-producer Hayao Miyazaki is often called \"the Walt Disney of Japan.\" His animated theatrical features have been smash hits in Japan, and many, including <i>My Neighbor Totoro</i> and <i>Kiki's Delivery Service</i>, are already familiar to American audiences. Now, with Disney-Miramax's imminent release of <i>Princess Mononoke,</i>, Miyazaki's masterwork and one of the top-grossing film in all Japanese history, this \"animation master\" is about to take America and the world by storm.<br /><br />Mixing first-hand interview and personal insights with critical evaluations of art, plot, production qualities, and literary themes, McCarthy provides a film-by-film appraisal that examines technique as well as message. She reveals Miyazaki to be not just a master of the art of animation, but a meticulous craftsman who sees his work as a medium for shaping the humanistic and environmental concerns of our times.<br /><br />An overview of the artist and his early career is followed by in-depth examinations of seven major Miyazaki films: <i>Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind, Laputa: Castle in the Sky, Castle of Cagliostro, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Porco Rosso</i>, and <i>Princess Mononoke</i>. Included are design and technical data, story synopses and character sketches, personnel and filmography data, and critical evaluation. Illustrations throughout, in color and black and white, show the detail and vigor of Miyazaki's art.<br /><br />Written for anime fans as well as students of film, literature, and popular culture, McCarthy's book raises animation criticism to a whole new level and is an essential guide to the work of a world-class filmmaker.<br /><br />London-based <b>Helen McCarthy</b> is author of <i>Anime! A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Animation, The Anime Movie Guide</i>, and (with Jonathan Clements) <i>The Erotic Anime Movie Guide</i>. She appears frequently on radio and TV and at conferences around the world.",

    "description": "Nobody knows more, both from first hand experience and legal expertise, about the abuse of presidential power and their dangers than John Dean, former counsel to President Nixon. In Worse Than Watergate, Dean delivers a stunning indictment of the current Bush administration, and issues an urgent alarm to the nation: the Bush team's obsession with secrecy and their willingness to deceive make them even more dangerous than Nixon's. Dean brilliantly explores Bush's emphasis on image over substance; his angry, mistrustful personality; his excessive fear of leaks; his reversing the work of his predecessors in opening up government; his imperial governing combined with deeply flawed decision making; and his serious abuses of national security secrecy. From refusing to explain the precarious health of the powerful vice president to hiding the identity of those setting the nation's energy policy, from obstructing 9/11 investigations to unprecedented secrecy in the name of fighting terrorism, Dean exposes the dangers of a presidency that is using weapons of mass deception against the American public.",

    "description": "Centuries in the future, Terrans have established a logging colony &amp; military base named \"New Tahiti\" on a tree-covered planet whose small, green-furred, big-eyed inhabitants have a culture centered on lucid dreaming. Terran greed spirals around native innocence &amp; wisdom, overturning the ancient society.<br /><br />Humans have learned interstellar travel from the Hainish (the origin-planet of all humanoid races, including Athsheans). Various planets have been expanding independently, but during the novel it's learned that the League of All Worlds has been formed. News arrives via an ansible, a new discovery. Previously they had been cut off, 27 light years from home.<br /><br />The story occurs after The Dispossessed, where both the ansible &amp; the League of Worlds are unrealised. Also well before Planet of Exile, where human settlers have learned to coexist. The 24th century has been suggested.<br /><br />Terran colonists take over the planet locals call Athshe, meaning \"forest,\" rather than \"dirt,\" like their home planet Terra. They follow the 19th century model of colonization: felling trees, planting farms, digging mines &amp; enslaving indigenous peoples. The natives are unequipped to comprehend this. They're a subsistence race who rely on the forests &amp; have no cultural precedent for tyranny, slavery or war. The invaders take their land without resistance until one fatal act sets rebellion in motion &amp; changes the people of both worlds forever.",

Their neighbour Elizabeth, a woman in her seventies, falls from an upstairs window and her granddaughter Jody is summoned to nurse her through her convalescence.<br /><br />The scene is set for a magical story of love and loneliness, of terror and human frailty, of the mystery and grace of ordinary experience. Alice Hoffman's ability to fuse the domestic and the mythic in a narrative of such gentle yet magnetic force confirms her stature as one of the most gifted of American novelists.",

    "description": "Was God telling the truth when he said, \"You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart\"? In his #1 bestseller <i>The Case for Christ</i>, Lee Strobel examined the claims of Christ, reaching the hard-won verdict that Jesus is God's unique son. In <i>The Case for Faith</i>, Strobel turns his skills to the most persistent emotional objections to belief---the eight \"heart barriers\" to faith. This Gold Medallion-winning book is for those who may be feeling attracted to Jesus but who are faced with difficult questions standing squarely in their path. For Christians, it will deepen their convictions and give them fresh confidence in discussing Christianity with even their most skeptical friends. \"Everyone --seekers, doubters, fervent believers-- benefits when Lee Strobel hits the road in search of answers, as he does again in <i>The Case for Faith</i>. In the course of his probing interviews, some of the toughest intellectual obstacles to faith fall away.\" --Luis Palau \"Lee Strobel has given believers and skeptics alike a gift in this book. He does not avoid seeking the most difficult questions imaginable, and refuses to provide simplistic answers that do more harm than good.\" --Jerry Sittser, professor of religion, Whitworth College, and author of <i>A Grace Disguised</i> and <i>The Will of God as a Way of Life</i>",

    "description": "Most people, upon hearing gunfire, would run away and hide. Conflict photojournalists have the opposite reaction: they actually look for trouble, and when they find it, get as close as possible and stand up to get the best shot. This thirst for the shot and the seeming nonchalance to the risks entailed earned Greg Marinovich, Joao Silva, Ken Oosterbroek, and Kevin Carter the moniker of the Bang-Bang Club. Oosterbroek was killed in township violence just days before South Africa's historic panracial elections. Carter, whose picture of a Sudanese child apparently being stalked by a vulture won him a Pulitzer Prize, killed himself shortly afterwards. Another of their posse, Gary Bernard, who had held Oosterbroek as he died, also committed suicide.<p> <i>The Bang-Bang Club</i> is a memoir of a time of rivalry, comradeship, machismo, and exhilaration experienced by a band of young South African photographers as they documented their country's transition to democracy. We forget too easily the political and ethnic violence that wracked South Africa as apartheid died a slow, spasmodic death. Supporters of the ANC and Inkatha fought bloody battles every day. The white security forces were complicit in fomenting and enabling some of the worst violence. All the while, the Bang-Bang Club took pictures. And while they did, they were faced with the moral dilemma of how far they should go in pursuit of an image, and whether there was a point at which they should stop their shooting and try to intervene. </p><p> This is a riveting and appalling book. It is simply written--these guys are photographers, not writers--but extremely engaging. They were adrenaline junkies who partied hard and prized the shot above all else. None of them was a hero; these men come across as overweeningly ambitious, egotistical, reckless, and selfish, though also brave and even principled. As South Africans, they were all invested in their country's future, even though, as whites, they were strangers in their own land as they covered the Hostel wars in the black townships. The mixture of the romantic appeal of the war correspondent with honest assessments of their personal failings is part of what makes this account so compelling and so singular among books of its ilk. \u2013 <i>J. Riches</i></p>",

    "description": "All Too Human is a new-generation political memoir, written from the refreshing perspective of one who got his hands on the levers of awesome power at an early age. At thirty, the author was at Bill Clinton's side during the presidential campaign of 1992, &amp; for the next five years he was rarely more than a step away from the president &amp; his other advisers at every important moment of the first term. What Liar's Poker did to Wall Street, this book will do to politics. It is an irreverent &amp; intimate portrait of how the nation's weighty business is conducted by people whose egos &amp; idiosyncrasies are no sturdier than anyone else's. Including sharp portraits of the Clintons, Al Gore, Dick Morris, Colin Powell, &amp; scores of others, as well as candid &amp; revelatory accounts of the famous debacles &amp; triumphs of an administration that constantly went over the top, All Too Human is, like its author, a brilliant combination of pragmatic insight &amp; idealism. It is destined to be the most important &amp; enduring book to come out of the Clinton administration.",

In <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> Jared Diamond presents the biologist's answer: geography, demography, and ecological happenstance. Diamond evenhandedly reviews human history on every continent since the Ice Age at a rate that emphasizes only the broadest movements of peoples and ideas. Yet his survey is binocular: one eye has the rather distant vision of the evolutionary biologist, while the other eye--and his heart--belongs to the people of New Guinea, where he has done field work for more than 30 years.",

    "description": "<div>Since his death in 1989, John Cassavettes has become increasingly renowned as a cinematic hero--a renegade loner who fought the Hollywood system, steering his own creative course in a career spanning thirty years. Having already established himself as an actor, he struck out as a filmmaker in 1959 with <i>Shadows</i>, and proceeded to build a formidable body of work, including such classics as <i>Faces</i>, <i>Woman Under the Influence</i>, <i>The Killing of a Chinese Bookie</i>, and <i>Gloria</i>. In <i>Cassavettes on Cassavettes</i>, Ray Carney presents the great director in his own words--frank, uncompromising, humane, and passionate about life and art. <br /></div>",

    "description": "Open the door to the next century with the only unabridged, definitive edition of the authentic prophecies of Michael Nostradamus since 1672.<br /><br />Henry C. Roberts, regarded by many to be Nostradamus redivivus, presents the original medieval French text of this legendary seer, alongside the verbatim English translation of every Canto. Roberts reveals his uncanny ability to relate the mystic visions of Nostradamus to actual and future events and unlocks the predictions within each of the verses to show that Nostradamus foretold such world events as the French Revolution, the American Civil War, the abdication of the Shah of Iran, and the rise and fall of the Eastern bloc centuries before they transpired. <br /><br />In his new introduction Roberts's grandson carries on with this work by revealing Nostradamus's ability to predict even recent events. Here Robert Lawrence shows that many of today's top news events such as the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, the tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales, as well as the Oklahoma City bombing and the downing of TWA Flight 800 were all predicted by Nostradamus. Even the revolution in worldwide communication brought about by the personal computer and the World Wide Web was foretold by this greatest of prophets.<br /><br />The secrets of Nostradamus's power to foresee the future has never been fully explained, but with this book you will be able to experience for yourself the scope of that power and, with the aid of Henry C. Roberts's interpretations, confidently open the door and know what life holds in store for us into the next millennium.",

    "description": "<b>Where do ideas come from?</b><br /><br />In <i>Catching the Big Fish</i>, internationally acclaimed filmmaker David Lynch provides a rare window into his methods as an artist, his personal working style, and the immense creative benefits he has experienced from the practice of meditation.<br /><br />Lynch describes the experience of \"diving within\" and \"catching\" ideas like fish - and then preparing them for television or movie screens, and other mediums in which he works, such as painting, music, and design. Lynch writes for the first time about his more than three-decade commitment to Transcendental Meditation and the difference it has made in his creative process.<br /><br />In brief chapters, Lynch explains the development of his ideas - where they came from, how he grasps them, and which ones appeal to him the most. He specifically discusses how he puts his thoughts into action and how he engages with others around him. Finally, he considers the self and the surrounding world - and how the process of \"diving within\" that has so deeply affected his own work can directly benefit others.<br /><br /><i>Catching the Big Fish</i> comes as a revelation to the legion of fans who have longed to better understand Lynch's personal vision. And it is equally intriguing to those who wonder how they can nurture their own creativity.",

At an elite university, Amy Haskel has been initiated into the country's most notorious secret society. But in this power-hungry world where new blood is at the mercy of old money, hooking up with the wrong people could be fatal.</b><br /><br />Eli University junior Amy Haskel never expected to be tapped into Rose &amp; Grave. She isn't rich, politically connected, or . . . well, male. So when Amy is one of the first female students to receive the distinctive black-lined invitation with the Rose &amp; Grave seal, she's blown away. Could they really mean her?<br /><br />Whisked off into an elaborate initiation rite, Amy awakens the next day to a new reality and a whole new set of \"friends\"--from the gorgeous son of a conservative governor to an Afrocentric lesbian activist whose society name is Thorndike. And that's when Amy starts to discover the truth about getting what you wish for. Because Rose &amp; Grave is quickly taking her away from her familiar world of classes and keggers, fueling a feud and undermining a very promising friendship with benefits. And that's before Amy finds out that her first duty as a member of Rose &amp; Grave is to take on a conspiracy of money and power that could, quite possibly, ruin her whole life.",

Sherry Argov's <i>Why Men Love Bitches</i> delivers a unique perspective as to why men are attracted to a strong woman who stands up for herself. With saucy detail on every page, this no-nonsense guide reveals why a strong woman is much more desirable than a \"yes woman\" who routinely sacrifices herself. The author provides compelling answers to the tough questions women often ask:<br /><br /> \u00b7 Why are men so romantic in the beginning and why do they change?<br /> \u00b7 Why do men take nice girls for granted?<br /> \u00b7 Why does a man respect a woman when she stands up for herself?<br /><br /> Full of advice, hilarious real-life relationship scenarios, \"she says/he thinks\" tables, and the author's unique \"Attraction Principles,\" <i>Why Men Love Bitches</i> gives you bottom-line answers. It helps you know who you are, stand your ground, and relate to men on a whole new level. Once you've discovered the feisty attitude men find so magnetic, you'll not only increase the romantic chemistry\u2014you'll gain your man's love and respect with far less effort.",

    "description": "Joe Strummer's untimely death at the age of fifty in December 2002 took from us one of the truly unique voices of modern music. The quintessential Rude Boy, punker, rebel musician, artist and activist, Strummer wrote some of the most important and influential music of the last century including \"Guns of Brixton,\" \"The Washington Bullets,\" \"Spanish Bombs,\" \"White Man in Hammersmith Palace,\" \"London's Burning,\" \"Lost in the Supermarket,\" and \"Garageland.\" Effectively melding raw creativity with radical politics, Strummer transformed punk rock from its early associations with reactionary, right wing and nihilistic politics into a social movement. From Rock Against Racism to the Anti-Nazi League Festival to supporting the H-Block protests, Strummer and The Clash led the charge for human rights. Let Fury Have the Hour collects articles, interviews, essays and reviews that chronicle Strummer's life both as a musician and a political activist. Included in this collection are essays and interviews by Antonino D'Ambrosio, alongside contributions from Peter Silverton, Barry Miles, Anya Philips, Sylvia Simmons, Vic Garbarini, Caroline Coons, Todd Martens, Joel Schalit and others. This book also includes original lyrics, photography, art, posters, and flyers, and offers the first serious examination of the life of this extraordinary man.",

Unaware of the treasure's value, he was cheated out of the fortune that should have been his by the man who hired him. The 34 pieces of silver were discovered after the war by the authorities and taken to the British Museum, where they reside today. Master storyteller Roald Dahl relates the unforgettable and true tale of the greatest treasure ever found in the British Isles.<br />",

    "description": "Originally published in <i>The Cornhill Magazine</i> in 1878 and in book form in 1879, <i>Daisy Miller</i> brought Henry James his first widespread commercial and critical success. The young Daisy Miller, an American on holiday with her mother on the shores of Switzerland\u2019s Lac Leman, is one of James\u2019s most vivid and tragic characters. Daisy\u2019s friendship with an American gentleman, Mr. Winterbourne, and her subsequent infatuation with a passionate but impoverished Italian bring to life the great Jamesian themes of Americans abroad, innocence versus experience, and the grip of fate. As Elizabeth Hardwick writes in her Introduction, Daisy Miller \u201clives on, a figure out of literature who has entered history as a name, a vision.\u201d",

Bient\u00f4t, ce sera la rentr\u00e9e \u00e0 Poudlard avec les autres \u00e9tudiants de sixi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e. Mais pourquoi le professeur Dumbledore vient-il en personne chercher Harry chez les Dursley ?<br /><br />Harry, Ron et Hermione entrent en sixi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e \u00e0 Poudlard o\u00f9 ils vont vivre leur derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e avant la majorit\u00e9 qui est fix\u00e9e, chez les sorciers, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de dix-sept ans. Des \u00e9v\u00e9nements particuli\u00e8rement marquants vont contribuer \u00e0 faire passer Harry du statut d\u2019adolescent \u00e0 celui d\u2019homme. Ce tome, sur fond de guerre contre un Voldemort plus puissant que jamais, se r\u00e9v\u00e8le plus sombre que les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. Secrets, alliances et trahisons conduisent aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements les plus dramatiques qu\u2019Harry ait eu \u00e0 affronter. Mais, en d\u00e9pit de ces \u00e9pisodes tragiques, il \u00e9mane du texte un sentiment g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019all\u00e9gresse et de joie de vivre d\u00fb \u00e0 l\u2019humour, aux preuves d\u2019amiti\u00e9, aux sc\u00e8nes romantiques, \u00e0 de nouvelles trouvailles po\u00e9tiques de J. K. Rowling, mais surtout \u00e0 la s\u00e9r\u00e9nit\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9e de Harry qui reprend confiance en lui. Ce dernier se plonge \u00e9galement dans les souvenirs d\u2019enfance de Voldemort. Il va ainsi mieux comprendre la personnalit\u00e9 de son adversaire car m\u00eame cet \u00eatre monstrueux poss\u00e8de une part d\u2019humanit\u00e9. Le sens des responsabilit\u00e9s et du sacrifice rev\u00eatent, ici encore, une dimension particuli\u00e8rement importante.",

    "description": "Roxana (1724), Defoe's last and darkest novel, is the autobiography of a woman who has traded her virtue, at first for survival, and then for fame and fortune. Its narrator tells the story of her own 'wicked' life as the mistress of rich and powerful men. A resourceful adventuress, she is also an unforgiving analyst of her own susceptibilities, who tells us of the price she pays for her successes. Endowed with many seductive skills, she is herself seduced: by money, by dreams of rank, and by the illusion that she can escape her own past. Unlike Defoe's other penitent anti-heroes, however, she fails to triumph over these weaknesses. Roxana's fame lies not only in the heroine's 'vast variety of fortunes', but in her attempts to understand the sometimes bitter lessons of her life as a 'Fortunate Mistress'. Defoe's achievement was to invent, in 'Roxana', a gripping story-teller as well as a gripping story.",

    "description": "In the claustrophobic, mannered world of British India, Linny Ingram seems the perfect society wife: pretty, gracious, subservient. But appearances can be deceptive. Linny Ingram was born Linny Gow, an orphan raised in the gray slums of Liverpool. Sold into prostitution by her stepfather when she was only eleven, Linny clung to the belief that she was meant for something more, something better, than life on the cold, dangerous streets.<br /><br />A stroke of luck granted Linny the chance to re-create herself as a proper middle-class young lady, allowing her to join \"the fishing fleet\" -- young women of good birth who sailed to India in search of husbands. India, with its exotic colors, sights, and smells, is a world away from the cold back alleys of Linny's childhood. But even there, she is haunted by her past, and by the constant threat of discovery. Soon she finds that respectability and marriage bring a new kind of imprisonment. But having come so far, Linny is not about to surrender easily. In the lush tropics of India she finds not only the means of rebellion ... she finds that she may be capable of feeling love and freedom after all.",

    "description": "Whether enemy or ally, demon or god, the penis is much more than a body part. Here, in an enlightening and entertaining cultural study, is a book that puts into context the central role of the penis within Western civilization. Deified by ancient pagan cultures and demonized by the early Roman church, the penis was later secularized by pioneering anatomists such as Leonardo da Vinci. After being measured 'scientifically' in an effort to subjugate some races while elevating others, the organ was psychoanalysed by Sigmund Freud. Now, after being politicized by feminism and exploited in countless ways by pop culture, Friedman shows how the arrival of erection industry products such as Viagra is more than a health or business story.

    "description": "The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in the Judean desert between 1947 and 1956 was one of the greatest archaeological finds of all time. Hidden in the caves at Qumran by the Essenes, a Jewish sect in existence before and during the time of Jesus, the Scrolls have transformed our understanding of the Hebrew Bible, early Judaism, and the origins of Christianity. This fully revised edition of the classic English translation by Geza Vermes, the world's leading scholar on the subject, offers an astonishing look into the organization, customs, and beliefs of the community at Qumran. Enhanced by much previously unpublished material and a new preface, this will remain the authoritative translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls for years to come.",

Irving, a renowned obstetrician and gynecologist, and includes Mr. Irving's incisive history of abortion politics in the United States. But <i>My Movie Business</i> focuses primarily on the thirteen years John Irving spent adapting his novel <i>The Cider House Rules</i> for the screen--for four different directors.<br /><br />Mr. Irving also writes about the failed effort to make his first novel, Setting Free the Bears, into a movie; about two of the films that were made from his novels (but not from his screenplays), <i>The World According to Garp</i> and <i>The Hotel New Hampshire</i>; about his slow progress at shepherding his screenplay of <i>A Son of the Circus</i> into production.<br /><br />Not least, and in addition to its qualities as a memoir--anecdotal, comic, affectionate, and candid--<i>My Movie Business</i> is an insightful essay on the essential differences between writing a novel and writing a screenplay.<br /><br />The photographs in <i>My Movie Business</i> were taken by Stephen Vaughan, the still photographer on the set of <i>The Cider House Rules</i>--a Miramax production directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m, with Michael Caine in the role of Dr. Larch. Concurrently with the November 1999 release of the film, Talk Miramax Books will publish John Irving's screenplay.",

    "description": "Part philosophical meditation, part cultural critique, The Body in Pain is a profoundly original study that has already stirred excitement in a wide range of intellectual circles. The book is an analysis of physical suffering and its relation to the numerous vocabularies and cultural forces--literary, political, philosophical, medical, religious--that confront it. Elaine Scarry bases her study on a wide range of sources: literature and art, medical case histories, documents on torture compiled by Amnesty International, legal transcripts of personal injury trials, and military and strategic writings by such figures as Clausewitz, Churchill, Liddell Hart, and Kissinger, She weaves these into her discussion with an eloquence, humanity, and insight that recall the writings of Hannah Arendt and Jean-Paul Sartre. Scarry begins with the fact of pain's inexpressibility. Not only is physical pain enormously difficult to describe in words--confronted with it, Virginia Woolf once noted, \"language runs dry\"--it also actively destroys language, reducing sufferers in the most extreme instances to an inarticulate state of cries and moans. Scarry analyzes the political ramifications of deliberately inflicted pain, specifically in the cases of torture and warfare, and shows how to be fictive. From these actions of \"unmaking\" Scarry turns finally to the actions of \"making\"--the examples of artistic and cultural creation that work against pain and the debased uses that are made of it. Challenging and inventive, The Body in Pain is landmark work that promises to spark widespread debate.",

The physical and moral wanderings of the Redcrosse Knight dramatize his effort to find the proper proportion of human to divine contributions to salvation--a key issue between Protestants and Catholics. Fantastic elements like alien humans, humanoids, and monsters and their respective dwelling places are vividly described.",

    "description": "One of the most acclaimed novels in recent memory, Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain is a masterpiece that is at once an enthralling adventure, a stirring love story, and a luminous evocation of a vanished American in all its savagery, solitude, and splendor.<br /><br />Sorely wounded and fatally disillusioned in the fighting at Petersburg, Inman, a Confederate soldier, decides to walk back to his home in the Blue Ridge Mountains and to Ada, the woman he loved there years before. His trek across the disintegrating South brings him into intimate and sometimes lethal converse with slaves and marauders, bounty hunters and witches, both helpful and malign. At the same time, Ada is trying to revive her father's derelict farm and learn to survive in a world where the old certainties have been swept away. As it interweaves their stories, Cold Mountain asserts itself as an authentic American Odyssey--hugely powerful, majestically lovely, and keenly moving.",

Michener brings Hawaii\u2019s epic history vividly to life in a classic saga that has captivated readers since its initial publication in 1959. As the volcanic Hawaiian Islands sprout from the ocean floor, the land remains untouched for centuries\u2014until, little more than a thousand years ago, Polynesian seafarers make the perilous journey across the Pacific, flourishing in this tropical paradise according to their ancient traditions. Then, in the early nineteenth century, American missionaries arrive, bringing with them a new creed and a new way of life. Based on exhaustive research and told in Michener\u2019s immersive prose, Hawaii is the story of disparate peoples struggling to keep their identity, live in harmony, and, ultimately, join together.",

    "description": "\u201cA superb collection, a splendid and much-needed book. Anderson has cleared away the dross and shown us the golden roots of fantasy before it became a genre.\u201d<br />\u2013Michael Moorcock, author of The Eternal Champion<br /><br />Many of today\u2019s top names in fantasy acknowledge J.R.R. Tolkien as the author whose work inspired them to create their own epics. But which writers influenced Tolkien himself? In a collection destined to become a classic in its own right, internationally recognized Tolkien expert Douglas A. Anderson, editor of The Annotated Hobbit, has gathered the fiction of the many gifted authors who sparked Tolkien\u2019s imagination. Included are Andrew Lang\u2019s romantic swashbuckler \u201cThe Story of Sigurd,\u201d which features magic rings and a ferocious dragon; an excerpt from E. A. Wyke-Smith\u2019s The Marvelous Land of Snergs, about creatures who were precursors to Tolkien\u2019s hobbits; and a never-before-published gem by David Lindsay, author of A Voyage to Arcturus,<i> </i>a novel that Tolkien praised highly both as a thriller and as a work of philosophy, religion, and morality.<br /><br />In stories packed with magical journeys, conflicted heroes, and terrible beasts, this extraordinary volume is one that no fan of fantasy or Tolkien should be without. These tales just might inspire a new generation of creative writers.",

    "description": "<i>Full Circle</i> invites us to accompany Chilean writer Luis Sepulv\u00e9da on a \"journey without a fixed itinerary\". Whatever his subject - brutalities suffered under Pinochet's dictatorship, sleepy tropical towns visited in exile, or the landscapes of legendary Patagonia - Sepulv\u00e9da is an unflinchingly honest yet lyrical toryteller. extravagant characters and extraordinary situations are memorably evoked: gauchos organising a tournament of lies, a scheming heiress on the lookout for a husband, a pilot with a corpse on board his plane... Part autobiography, part travel memoir, <i>Full Circle</i> brings us the distinctive voice of one of South America's most compelling writers",

The investigation that follows uncovers an extraordinarily complex and puzzling true-crime story. <br /><br />Only Vincent Bugliosi, who recounted his successful prosecution of mass murderer Charles Manson in the bestseller <i>Helter Skelter</i>, was able to draw together the hundreds of conflicting details of the mystery and reconstruct what <i>really</i> happened when four people found hell in a tropical paradise. <i>And the Sea Will Tell</i> reconstructs the events and subsequent trial of a riveting true murder mystery, and probes into the dark heart of a serpentine scenario of death.",

    "description": "In this indispensable book, urban visionary Jane Jacobs--renowned author of <b>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</b> and <b>The Economy of Cities</b>--convincingly argues that as agrarianism gives way to a technology-based future, we stand on the brink of a new dark age, a period of cultural collapse. Jacobs pinpoints five pillars of our culture that are in serious decay: community and family; higher education; the effective practice of science; taxation, and government; and the self-regulation of the learned professions. The corrosion of these pillars, Jacobs argues, is linked to societal ills such as environmental crisis, racism, and the growing gulf between rich and poor. But this is a hopeful book as well as a warning. Drawing on her vast frame of reference\u2013from fifteenth-century Chinese shipbuilding to Ireland\u2019s cultural rebirth\u2013Jacobs suggests how the cycles of decay can be arrested and our way of life renewed. Invigorating and accessible, <b>Dark Age Ahead </b>is not only the crowning achievement of Jane Jacobs\u2019 career, but one of the most important works of our time.",

    "description": "As the Easter Rebellion looms, tension mounts in the rain-soaked streets of Dublin. Tension is also ratcheting up at home. Pat Dumay is a Catholic and an Irish patriot. His relentlessly pious mother pursues her own private war with his stepfather, a man sunk in religious speculation and drink. Meanwhile Pat's Protestant soldier cousin, Andrew Chase-White, puzzles out his complex emotions about Ireland and the girl he loves. Weaving between them moves Millie Kinnard: fast, feminist, and only just respectable.",

One of his favorite characters, aging writer Kilgore Trout, finds to his horror that a Midwest car dealer is taking his fiction as truth. The result is murderously funny satire as Vonnegut looks at war, sex, racism, success, politics, and pollution in America and reminds us how to see the truth.",

His well-known scatological realism, exuberant violence, and dark, unsettling humour give his unique version of history a thoroughly modern chill.",

    "description": "Did you ever wish that you really understood money? Well, Dave Barry wishes that he did, too. But that hasn\u2019t stopped him from writing this book. In it, Dave explores (as only he can) such topics as:<br /><br />\u2022 How the U.S. economy works, including the often overlooked role of Adam Sandler<br />\u2022 Why it is not a good idea to use squirrels for money<br />\u2022 Strategies that will give you the confidence you need to try for a good job, even though you are\u2014let\u2019s be honest\u2014a no-talent loser<br />\u2022 How corporate executives, simply by walking into their offices, immediately become much stupider<br />\u2022 An absolutely foolproof system for making money in the stock market, requiring only a little effort (and access to time travel)<br />\u2022 Surefire tips for buying and selling real estate, the key being: Never buy\u2014or, for that matter, sell\u2014real estate<br />\u2022 How to minimize your federal taxes, safely and legally, by cheating<br />\u2022 Why good colleges cost so much, and how to make sure your child does not get into one<br />\u2022 How to reduce the cost of your medical care by basically not getting any<br />\u2022 Estate planning, especially the financial benefits of an early death<br />\u2022 And many, many pictures of Suze Orman<br /><br />But that\u2019s only the beginning! Dave has also included in this book all of the important points from a book written by Donald Trump, so you don\u2019t have to read it yourself. Plus he explains how to tip, how to negotiate for everything (including bridge tolls), how to argue with your spouse about money, and how much allowance to give your children (three dollars is plenty). He also presents, for the first time in print anywhere, the Car Dealership Code of Ethics (\u201cEthic Seven: The customer is an idiot\u201d). Also, there are many gratuitous references to Angelina Jolie naked. You can\u2019t afford not to buy this book! Probably you need several copies.<br /><br /><br />What kind of financial shape are you in right now? This scientific quiz will show you. <br /><br />Be honest in your answers: If you lie, you\u2019ll only be lying to yourself! The place to lie is on your federal tax return.<br /><br /><br />What is your annual income?<br />1. More than $50,000.<br />2. Less than $50,000.<br />3. However much I get when I return these empties.<br /><br />Not counting your mortgage, how much money do you currently owe?<br />1. Less than $10,000.<br />2. More than $10,000.<br />3. Men are threatening to cut off my thumbs.<br /><br />How would you describe your portfolio?<br />1. Conservative, mainly bonds and blue-chip equities.<br />2. Aggressive, mainly options and speculative stocks.<br />3. My what?<br /><br />When analyzing an investment, what do you consider to be the most important factor?<br />1. The amount of return.<br />2. The degree of risk.<br />3. The name of the jockey.<br /><br />How do you plan to finance your retirement?<br />1. Savings.<br />2. Social security.<br />3. Sale of kidneys.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i>\u2014from the Introduction: \u201cWhy You Need This Book\u201d</i>\n</b><br /><br /><br />Also available as a Crown eBook.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "description": "This story of raging comedy and despair centers on the tempestuous marriage of an heiress and a Vietnam veteran. From their \"carpenter gothic\" rented house, Paul sets himself up as a media consultant for Reverend Ude, an evangelist mounting a grand crusade that conveniently suits a mining combine bidding to take over an ore strike on the site of Ude's African mission. At the still center of the breakneck action--revealed in Gaddis's inimitable virtuoso dialoge--is Paul's wife, Liz, and over it all looms the shadowy figure of McCandless, a geologist from whom Paul and Liz rent their house. As Paul mishandles the situation, his wife takes the geologist to her bed and a fire and aborted assassination occur; Ude issues a call to arms as harrowing as any Jeremiad--and Armageddon comes rapidly closer. Displaying Gaddis's inimitable virtuoso dialogue, and his startling treatments of violence and sexuality, Carpenter's Gothic \"shows again that Gaddis is among the first rank of contemporary American writers\" (Malcolm Bradbury, \"The Washington Post Book World\" ). <br />\"An unholy landmark of a novel--an extra turret added on to the ample, ingenious, audacious Gothic mansion Gaddis has been building in American letters\" --Cynthia Ozick, \"The New York Times Book Review\" <br />\"Everything in this compelling and brilliant vision of America--the packaged sleaze, the incipient violence, the fundamentalist furor, the constricted sexuality--is charged with the force of a volcanic eruption. \"Carpenter's Gothic\" will reenergize and give shape to contemporary literature.\" --Walter Abish",

She is a romantic idealistic in revolt against the puritan snobbery of her parents, trying to live to the full with every nerve, emotion, and instinct laid bare to experience. For her, this is a time of solitary reading daydreams, dancing -- and the first disturbing encounters with sex. The first of Doris Lessing's timeless Children of Violence novels, Martha Quest is an endearing masterpiece.",

But in 1994 her idyllic world was ripped apart as Rwanda descended into a bloody genocide. Immaculee\u2019s family was brutally murdered during a killing spree that lasted three months and claimed the lives of nearly a million Rwandans.<br /><br />Incredibly, Immaculee survived the slaughter. For 91 days, she and seven other women huddled silently together in the cramped bathroom of a local pastor while hundreds of machete-wielding killers hunted for them.\u00a0<br /><br />It was during those endless hours of unspeakable terror that Immaculee discovered the power of prayer, eventually shedding her fear of death and forging a profound and lasting relationship with God. She emerged from her bathroom hideout having discovered the meaning of truly unconditional love\u2014a love so strong she was able seek out and forgive her family\u2019s killers.<br /><br />The triumphant story of this remarkable young woman\u2019s journey through the darkness of genocide will inspire anyone whose life has been touched by fear, suffering, and loss.",

During flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and a total involvement with life. In this new edition of his groundbreaking classic work, Csikszentmihalyi demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance. <i>Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</i> teaches how, by ordering the information that enters our consciousness, we can discover true happiness and greatly improve the quality of our lives.",

    "description": "Anne Michaels\u2019 spellbinding d\u00e9but novel<i> </i>has quickly become one of the most beloved and talked-about books of the decade. As a young boy during the Second World War, Jakob Beer is rescued from the mud in Poland by an unlikely saviour, the scientist Athos Roussos, and he is taken to Greece, then, at war\u2019s end, to Toronto. It is here that his loss gradually surfaces, as does the haunting question of his sister\u2019s fate. Later in life, as a translator and a poet, and now with the glorious Michaela, Jakob meets Ben, a young professor whose own legacies of the war kindle within him a fascination with the older man and his writing. <i>Fugitive Pieces</i> is a work of rare vision that is at once lyrical, sensual, profound. With its vivid evocation of landscape and character, its unique excavation of memory and time, it is a wholly unforgettable novel that draws us into the lives of its characters with compassion and recognition.",

    "description": "In this collection of short works that defy easy categorization, Margaret Atwood displays, in condensed and crystallized form, the trademark wit and viruosity of her best-selling novels, brilliant stories, and insightful poetry. Among the jewels gathered here are Gertrude offering Hamlet a piece of her mind, the real truth about the Little Red Hen, a reincarnated bat explaining how Bram Stoker got \"Dracula\" all wrong, and the five methods of making a man (such as the \"Traditional Method\": \"Take some dust off the ground. Form. Breathe into the nostrils the breath of life. Simple, but effective!\") There are parables, monologues, prose poems, condensed science fiction, reconfigured fairy tales, and other miniature masterpieces--punctuated with charming illustrations by the author. A must for her fans, and a wonderful gift for all who savor the art of exquisite prose, \"Good Bones And Simple Murders\" marks the first time these writings have been available in a trade edition in the United States.\"[Atwood] proves she is an accomplished miniaturist...She can pack more wallop into less space than any other writer in her weight class\".-- \"Toronto Globe And Mail\"",

    "description": "Alexandre Dumas\u2019s most famous tale\u2014 and possibly the most famous historical novel of all time\u2014 in a handsome hardcover volume.<br /><br />This swashbuckling epic of chivalry, honor, and derring-do, set in France during the 1620s, is richly populated with romantic heroes, unattainable heroines, kings, queens, cavaliers, and criminals in a whirl of adventure, espionage, conspiracy, murder, vengeance, love, scandal, and suspense. Dumas transforms minor historical figures into larger- than-life characters: the Comte d\u2019Artagnan, an impetuous young man in pursuit of glory; the beguilingly evil seductress \u201cMilady\u201d; the powerful and devious Cardinal Richelieu; the weak King Louis XIII and his unhappy queen\u2014and, of course, the three musketeers themselves, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, whose motto \u201call for one, one for all\u201d has come to epitomize devoted friendship. With a plot that delivers stolen diamonds, masked balls, purloined letters, and, of course, great bouts of swordplay, <i>The Three Musketeers </i>is eternally entertaining.",

Unfortunately, there are those who envy his good fortune enough to ruin him forever. Their machinations lead to his imprisonment in the Chateau d'If for seventeen years. Through all those years, Dantes cherishes one hope--to escape from prison and take his revenge on those who put him there. After a harrowing escape, Dantes begins his plan...but his revenge may mean suffering for those as innocent as he once was.",

Based on groundbreaking research and numerous interviews, Rashid explains the roots of fundamentalist rage in Central Asia, describes the goals and activities of its militant organizations, including Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda, and suggests ways of neutralizing the threat and bringing stability to the troubled region. A timely and pertinent work, <i>Jihad</i> is essential reading for anyone who seeks to gain a better understanding of a region we overlook at our peril.",

What he treasures is the superb local specialty. And he will go anywhere to find one. As it happens, some of his favorite dishes can be found only in their place of origin. Join Trillin on his charming, funny culinary adventures as he samples fried marlin in Barbados and the barbecue of his boyhood in Kansas City. Travel alongside as he hunts for the authentic fish taco, and participates in a \u201cboudin blitzkrieg\u201d in the part of Louisiana where people are accustomed to buying these spicy sausages and polishing them off in the parking lot. (\u201cCajun boudin not only doesn\u2019t get outside the state, it usually doesn\u2019t even get home.\u201d) In New York, Trillin even tries to use a glorious local specialty, the bagel, to lure his daughters back from California. <b>Feeding a Yen</b> is a delightful reminder of why <i>New York</i> magazine called Calvin Trillin \u201cour funniest food writer.\u201d",

    "description": "The Epic of Gilgamesh is the world\u2019s oldest epic masterpiece.<br /><br />More than a thousand years before Homer or the Bible, Mesopotamian poets sang of the hero-king Gilgamesh, who sought to crown his superhuman exploits by finding eternal life. This Norton Critical Edition presents translations by Benjamin R. Foster, Douglas Frayne, and Gary Beckman of the entire Gilgamesh narrative tradition, with some texts now in English for the first time. In addition to the eleven tablets of the great Akkadian epic, written around 1700 B.C.E., the book includes seven Sumerian poems about Gilgamesh, written before 2000 B.C.E., as well as the later Hittite version and other related sources, among them a Babylonian parody of the epic.<br /><br />\"Criticism\" provides interpretive essays by William Moran, Thorkild Jacobsen, and Rivkah Harris and concludes with a modern poetic response to the Gilgamesh epic by Hillary Major.<br /><br />A Glossary of Proper Names and a Selected Bibliography are also included.",

    "description": "<p>Writing at the time of political and social crisis in Athens Aristophanes was an eloquent yet bawdy challenger to the demagogue and the sophist. The Achanians is a plea for peace set against the background of the long war with Sparta. In Lysistrata a band of women tap into the awesome power of sex in order to end a war. The darker comedy of The Clouds satirizes Athenian philosophers, Socrates in particular, and reflects the uncertainties of a generation in which all traditional religious and ethical beliefs were being challenged.<br /><br />For this edition Alan Sommerstein has completely revised his translation of these three plays, bringing out the full nuances of Aristophanes\u2019 ribald humour and intricate word play, with a new introduction explaining the historical and cultural background to the plays.</p>",

She has authored four books, -including <i>The God of Small Things</i>, which won the Booker Prize. This summer, she will accept the Lannan Award for Cultural Freedom.",

In fact, Luke has never had a friend.<br /><br />Luke is one of the shadow children, a third child forbidden by the Population Police. He's lived his entire life in hiding, and now, with a new housing development replacing the woods next to his family's farm, he is no longer even allowed to go outside.<br /><br />Then, one day Luke sees a girl's face in the window of a house where he knows two other children already live. Finally, he's met a shadow child like himself. Jen is willing to risk everything to come out of the shadows -- does Luke dare to become involved in her dangerous plan? Can he afford \"not\" to?",

Mitty was a carefree guy: he didn't worry about terrorists or blackouts or grades or anything, which is why he was late getting started on his Advanced Bio report.<br /><br />Mitty does feel a little pressure to hand something in if he doesn't, he'll be switched out of Advanced Bio, which would be unfortunate since Olivia's in Advanced Bio. So he considers it good luck when he finds some old medical books in his family's weekend house that focus on something he could write about. <br /><br />But when he discovers an old envelope with two scabs in one of the books, the report is no longer about the grades: it's about life and death. His own.This edge-of-your-seat thriller will leave you breathless.",

He's been practicing all summer and can't wait to see his classmates' faces when he beats them all. But on the first day of school, a new girl boldly crosses over to the boys' side of the playground and outruns everyone.<br /><br />That's not a very promising beginning for a friendship, but Jess and Leslie Burke become inseparable. Leslie has imagination. Together, she and Jess create Terabithia, a magical kingdom in the woods where the two of them reign as king and queen, and their imaginations set the only limits. Then one morning a terrible tragedy occurs. Only when Jess is able to come to grips with this tragedy does he finally understand the strength and courage Leslie has given him.",

    "description": "As believers, our walk with God is motivated by hope-not the bland, vague notion most people have, but the expectation of an exotic, pleasurable inheritance that guides us and fires our passion...or, at least, should.Ted Dekker has written an expose on the death of pleasure within the Church. Because many of us have set aside hope and the inspired imagination that drives it, Dekker says we have been lulled into a slumber of boredom, even despondency. Our faith wanes, the joy at having been liberated fades, and we feel powerless. The Slumber of Christianity explores what robs us of happiness and how we can rediscover it and live lives that rekindle hope. The pursuit of pleasure is a gift to all humans-a function of the Creator himself, who is bent upon our happiness. It's time for Christians to reclaim our inheritance of pleasure. The Slumber of Christianity will inflame hearts toward full-fledged, mind-expanding encounters with hope, through the imagination.",

    "description": "Introduction by Lorenzo Carcaterra<br /><br />A popular bestseller since its publication in 1844, The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the great page-turning thrillers of all time. Set against the tumultuous years of the post-Napoleonic era, Alexandre Dumas\u2019s grand historical romance recounts the swashbuckling adventures of Edmond Dant\u00e8s, a dashing young sailor falsely accused of treason. The story of his long imprisonment, dramatic escape, and carefully wrought revenge offers up a vision of France that has become immortal. As Robert Louis Stevenson declared, \u201cI do not believe there is another volume extant where you can breathe the same unmingled atmosphere of romance.\u201d<br /><br />INCLUDES A MODERN LIBRARY READING GROUP GUIDE",

Now one scientist, Dan Sylveste, will stop at nothing to solve the Amarantin riddle before ancient history repeats itself. With no other resources at his disposal, Sylveste forges a dangerous alliance with the cyborg crew of the starship <em>Nostalgia for Infinity</em>. But as he closes in on the secret, a killer closes in on him. Because the Amarantin were destroyed for a reason \u2014 and if that reason is uncovered, the universe\u2014and reality itself \u2014 could be irrecoverably altered\u2026.",

          "title": "Revelation Space",
          "description": "The Revelation Space universe is a fictional universe which was created by Alastair Reynolds and used as the setting for a number of his novels and stories. Its fictional history follows the human species through various conflicts from the relatively near future (roughly 2200) to approximately AD 40000 (all the novels to date are set between 2427 and 2727, although certain stories extend beyond this period). It takes its name from Revelation Space, which was the first published novel set in the universe.\n    \n    The main trilogy (also known as the Inhibitor trilogy) consists of 1) Revelation Space, 2) Redemption Ark and 3) Absolution Gap, and deals with humanity coming to the attention of the inhibitors and the resultant war between them.\n    \n    Reynolds says of the reading order: \"Of my books to date, five are set in the same universe. The reading order isn\u2019t that critical, in my view, but it probably improves things to read REVELATION SPACE, REDEMPTION ARK and ABSOLUTION GAP in that sequence. The other related books, CHASM CITY and THE PREFECT, as well as the collections DIAMOND DOGS, TURQUOISE DAYS and GALACTIC NORTH, can be read at any point (or in fact, not read at all).\"\n    \n    This is the approximate chronological order for the short stories, novels and novellas:\n    \n    Great Wall of Mars* - <i>(2205, published February 2000)</i>\n    Glacial* - <i>(2217, published March 2001)</i>\n    A Spy in Europa* - <i>(ca. 2330 - 2340, published 1997)</i>\n    Weather* - <i>(2358, published 2006)</i>\n    The Prefect (Novel, Standalone) - <i>(2427, published 2007)</i>\n    The Last Log of the Lachrimosa**** - <i>(ca. 2500 - 2550, published 2014)</i>\n    Diamond Dogs** - <i>(ca. 2500 - 2550, published 2001)</i>\n    Monkey Suit*** - <i>(ca. 2511, published 2009)</i>\n    Dilation Sleep* - <i>(ca. 2513 - 2540, published 1990)</i>\n    Chasm City (Novel, Standalone) - <i>(ca. 2517 - 2524, published 2001)</i>\n    Grafenwalder's Bestiary* - <i>(ca. 2540, published 2006)</i>\n    Turquoise Days** - <i>(2541, published 2002)</i>\n    Revelation Space (Novel, #1 of The Inhibitor Trilogy) - <i>(2524 - 2567, published 2000)</i>\n    Nightingale* - <i>(ca. 2600, published 2006)</i>\n    Redemption Ark (Novel, #2 of The Inhibitor Trilogy) - <i>(2605 - 2651, published 2002)</i>\n    Absolution Gap (Novel, #3 of The Inhibitor Trilogy) - <i>(ca. 2615 - 3125, published 2003)</i>\n    Galactic North* - <i>(ca. 2303 - 40000, published 1999)</i>\n    \n    *Story or Novella in Galactic North\n    **Novella in Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days\n    ***Story originally published in Death Ray #20 (July 2009); reprinted in Deep Navigation\n    ****Story originally published in Subterranean (Summer 2014); also on their website\n    \n    The reading order for Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space universe stories is complex, with the novels overlapping with the short stories (collected in Galactic North) and the two novellas (collected in Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days). Whether the chronological order is the best reading order for the books or not is debatable. It mostly works, although  'Weather' contains the answer to a major mystery from the main trilogy about the Conjoiner lighthugger drives and may benefit from being read later on. \n    \n    'Great Wall of Mars' and 'Glacial' introduce characters who otherwise show up out of nowhere in Redemption Ark, and 'Galactic North' (the story)  explains the ending to Absolution Gap and puts something of a full stop on the whole series and story.",

    "description": "Hattie Owen enjoys peaceful Millerton summertimes with <i>houses nodding in the heavy air,</i> being in charge of Miss Hagerty's breakfast tray at her parents' boardinghouse, and drinking lemonade on the porch after supper. Yet this year, it's different -- Hattie's uncle Adam is coming home. Returning from a Chicago school that's just closed and whose existence is kept quiet by adult family members, Adam is a 21-year-old man with a child's mind, having a knack for talking quickly, a savant-like ability for remembering weekdays, and a passion for <i>I Love Lucy</i>. Hattie and Adam wind up spending precious time together -- including a visit to the recently arrived carnival with Hattie's new friend, Leila -- which makes her feel soulfully connected to her uncle, especially when he declares that she's <i>one of the people who can lift the corners of our universe.</i> But when Hattie takes Adam on the Ferris wheel one night, it sets off dramatic events that lead Hattie's family to strengthen its bonds and changes her life's outlook forever.",

Each book includes educational tools alongside the text, enabling students and readers alike to gain a deeper and more developed understanding of the writer and their work.<br /><br />Climb aboard for the swashbuckling adventure of a lifetime. <i>Treasure Island</i> has enthralled (and caused slight seasickness) for decades. The names Long John Silver and Jim Hawkins are destined to remain pieces of folklore for as long as children want to read Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s most famous book. With its dastardly plot and motley crew of rogues and villains, it seems unlikely that children will ever say no to this timeless classic.<br /><br />Enriched Classics enhance your engagement by introducing and explaining the historical and cultural significance of the work, the author\u2019s personal history, and what impact this book had on subsequent scholarship. Each book includes discussion questions that help clarify and reinforce major themes and reading recommendations for further research.<br /><br />Read with confidence.",

    "description": "A new, definitive translation of Heidegger\u2019s most important work.<br /><br />The publication of Martin Heidegger\u2019s magnum opus, Being and Time, in 1927 signaled an intellectual event of the first order and had an impact in fields far beyond that of philosophy proper. Among the most complex and original analyses of the character of philosophic inquiry and the relation of the possibility of such inquiry to the human situation, Being and Time has long been recognized as a landmark work of the twentieth century. Still provocative and much disputed, Heidegger\u2019s text has been taken as the inspiration for a variety of innovative movements in fields ranging from psychoanalysis, literary theory, existentialism, ethics, hermeneutics, and theology. A work that disturbs the traditions of philosophizing that it inherits, Being and Time raises questions about the end of philosophy and the possibilities for thinking liberated from the presumptions of metaphysics.<br /><br />This new translation by Joan Stambaugh takes account of English-language Heidegger research since the first translation of Being and Time in 1962. The Stambaugh translation captures the vital relation to language that animates Heidegger\u2019s original text. Through this translation elements of Being and Time that were not so clearly evident hitherto should become more apparent to readers of the English text. The new translation of key notions here should serve as the standard for Heidegger studies to come.<br /><br />\u201cStambaugh\u2019s new version has large virtues, and improves on the only alternative \u2026 [It] is best suited to beginning or general audiences \u2026 These will find its spare and unobtrusive apparatus, which lets the text stand out more simply on its own and not bristling with flagged complications, a decisive virtue \u2026 As a supplement or for comparison, or as a vehicle for reacquainting oneself with the work, it gives excellent service.\u201d \u2014 TLS<br /><br />\u201cThis new translation \u2026 offers the text in a more precise and understandable English than earlier editions.\u201d \u2014 Library Journal<br /><br />\u201cStambaugh\u2019s greatest merit as a translator is her ability to render the most difficult of Heidegger\u2019s prose \u2026 into an English that remains both elegant and as faithful as possible to the original \u2026 The bilingual glossary and index in the back are marvelously helpful \u2026 Any translation of Sein und Zeit cannot help being a welcome contribution, even a significant landmark, within the world of Heidegger scholarship.\u201d \u2014 MLN<br /><br />Joan Stambaugh is Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Hunter College. She is the author of The Real is Not the Rational, The Finitude of Being, and The Other Nietzsche, all published by SUNY Press.<br /><br /><br />Table of Contents<br /><br /><br />Translator's Preface<br /><br />Author's Preface to the Seventh German Edition<br /><br />[Exergue]<br /><br />INTRODUCTION<br />The Exposition of the Question of the Meaning of Being <br />I.

Through the gripping events of their story, Dostoevsky portrays the social and spiritual strivings in what was both a golden age and a tragic turning point in Russian culture.",

It is about passion, betrayal and madness, about friendship and the joy and dignity of work, about character and fate, affliction and spirituality.",

They belong to a boy, a boy who has not seemed remarkable until now. And Helen--terrified, but intrigued--is drawn to him. The fact that he is in a body and she is not presents this unlikely couple with their first challenge. But as the lovers struggle to find a way to be together, they begin to discover the secrets of their former lives and of the young people they come to possess.",

    "description": "Audrey Niffenegger's innovative debut, The Time Traveler's Wife, is the story of Clare, a beautiful art student, and Henry, an adventuresome librarian, who have known each other since Clare was six and Henry was thirty-six, and were married when Clare was twenty-three and Henry thirty-one. Impossible but true, because Henry is one of the first people diagnosed with Chrono-Displacement Disorder: periodically his genetic clock resets and he finds himself misplaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity in his life, past and future. His disappearances are spontaneous, his experiences unpredictable, alternately harrowing and amusing.<br /><br />The Time Traveler's Wife depicts the effects of time travel on Henry and Clare's marriage and their passionate love for each other, as the story unfolds from both points of view. Clare and Henry attempt to live normal lives, pursuing familiar goals--steady jobs, good friends, children of their own. All of this is threatened by something they can neither prevent nor control, making their story intensely moving and entirely unforgettable.<br />(front flap)",

    "description": "Sex Splashed across magazine covers, billboards, and computer screens-sex is casual, aggressive, and absolutely everywhere. And everybody's doing it, right? In Real Sex, heralded young author Lauren F. Winner speaks candidly to Christians about the difficulty\u2014and the importance\u2014of sexual chastity. With honesty and wit, she talks about her struggle to live a celibate life. Never dodging tough terms like \"confession\" and \"sin,\" Winner grounds her discussion of chastity first and foremost in Scripture. She confronts cultural lies about sex and challenges how we talk about sex in church. Her biblically grounded observations and suggestions will be especially valuable to unmarried Christians struggling with the sexual mania of today's culture. Real Sex is essential reading for Christians grappling with chastity and a valuable tool for pastors.",

A few of these works have been preserved in the collection of Norse poetry known as the \"Poetic Edda.",

    "description": "Welcome to the model dorm, where you're not mad that your roommate, Christiane, is hooking up with a Brazilian male model on your bunk, but that she's wearing your Dior heels while doing it; where the alcoholic Kylie leaves stains from her Metamucil martinis on the carpet; and where you help Svetlana, the Ukrainian cokehead, clean up after her very public nosebleed. You're all beautiful girls, dropped in the middle of the most exciting city in the world, crammed together in a ten-by-twelve bedroom, and you've made the dorm your home -- for better or for worse. Eighteen-year-old Heather Johnston knows she has been given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity when she is signed by a premiere New York modeling agency. She leaves her small Virginia hometown dreaming of \"Vogue\" spreads and a luxurious loft with a glorious view. Arriving in Manhattan, she is instead given the key to a one-bedroom apartment furnished with bunk beds and IKEA floor samples. Her roommates are girls who are new to modeling, new to the country, or who just aren't making enough money to pay rent anywhere else. Despite their humble quarters, they form an unlikely family. By day they shuttle between castings and shoots. At night they really come to life in the VIP rooms of New York's hottest clubs.<br /><br />While this world is fast-paced and fun, Heather questions whether modeling is the fairy-tale she imagined it to be. When she gets a part-time job at a prestigious gallery and discovers a passion for art, she starts to reconsider her future. Is she ready to say good-bye to her dreams of wealth and celebrity and follow a different path?<br /><br />Fun, campy, and ultimately full of heart, \"Secrets of the Model Dorm\" takes you behindthe scenes of the world's most glamorous industry and exposes all its dirty little secrets: backseat blow jobs, nasty drug habits, thousand-dollar bottles of champagne, wealthy club managers from France, backstabbing roommates, haute couture, and all.",

She has finally left her New Jersey hometown/hellhole for Columbia University in New York City; she's more into her boyfriend, Marcus Flutie, than ever (so what if he's at a Buddhist college in California?); and she's making new friends who just might qualify as stand-ins for her beloved best friend, Hope. <br />But Jessica soon realizes that her bliss might not last. She lands an internship at a snarky Brooklyn-based magazine, but will she fit in with the uberhip staff (and will she even want to)? As she and Marcus hit the rocks, will she end up falling for her GOPunk, neoconservative RA . . . or the hot (and married!) Spanish grad student she's assisting on a summer project . . . or the oh-so-sensitive emo boy down the hall? Will she even make it through college now that her parents have cut her off financially? And what do the cryptic one-word postcards from Marcus really mean? <br />With hilarious insight, the hyperobservant Jessica Darling struggles through her college years--and the summers in between--while maintaining her usual mix of wit, cynicism, and candor. \"From the Hardcover edition.\"",

While trying to understand his dissatisfaction with the present, Seth discovers the life and work of Kalo, a forgotten <i>New Yorker </i>cartoonist from the 1940s. But his obsession blinds him to the needs of his lover and the quiet desperation of his family. Wry self-reflection and moody colours characterize Seth's style in this tale about learning lessons from nostalgia. His playful and sophisticated experiment with memoir provoked a furious debate among cartoon historians and archivists about the existence of Kalo, and prompted a <i>Details</i> feature about Seth's \"hoax\".",

It's been locked up for years now and most people would naturally assume that it's completely abandoned. Look closer. Peer in through the display window into the dimly lit office and there on the far wall you will just be able to make out the black and white photographs of a pair of rather grim looking businessmen: Abraham and Simon Matchcard.<br /><br />If you were to go in further\u2014back through that battered safety door and into the living and work spaces of the old building you would pass into the hidden world that has sustained these lonely brothers for more than five decades.<br /><br />In this, the first of two books, you will meet the Matchcard brothers and follow them through their journeys of disappointments, loss, and isolations. Two salesmen who have failed to \"close.\"",

Though his father is a reclusive scholar, his mother a pious though confused Catholic, and his uncle a shameless opportunist determined to gain power in the shifting politics of their post-colonial nation, Matapari remains an unsullied child who wears Reeboks, drinks Coke, reads Japanese comics, and watches <i>Rambo</i>. But when his family becomes the nucleus of the revolution for democracy, Matapari proves to be the ideal narrator for this story of violent upheaval and bloody corruption\u2013a voice whose ironic innocence makes bearable and even humorous the awful realities of the world it describes.",

Alexandra, a sculptor, summons thunderstorms; Jane, a cellist, floats on the air; and Sukie, the local gossip columnist, turns milk into cream. Their happy little coven takes on new, malignant life when a dark and moneyed stranger, Darryl Van Horne, refurbishes the long-derelict Lenox mansion and invites them in to play. Thenceforth scandal flits through the darkening, crooked streets of Eastwick and through the even darker fantasies of the town\u2019s collective psyche.",

These can mostly be read as stand-alone in any order, but based on internal chronology <i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</i> is the first Poirot story and <i>Curtain</i> was written to be the final Poirot story and should be read last. Other points to note are:\n    \n    1. <i>Lord Edgware Dies</i> should be read before <i>After the Funeral</i>.\n    2. <i>Five Little Pigs</i> should be read before <i>Elephants Can Remember</i>.\n    3. <i>Cat Among the Pigeons</i> should be read before <i>Hallowe\u2019en Party</i>.\n    4. <i>Mrs McGinty\u2019s Dead</i> should be read before <i>Hallowe\u2019en Party</i> and <i>Elephants Can Remember</i>.\n    5. <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i> should be read before <i>Murder in Mesopotamia</i>.\n    6. <i>Three Act Tragedy</i> should be read before <i>Hercule Poirot\u2019s Christmas</i>.\n    \n    <i>Black Coffee</i> by Charles Osborne (#45 on this list) is a novelization of Agatha Christie's play of the same name (#7 on this list).\n    \n    The two volumes <i>Hercule Poirot: The Complete Short Stories</i> and <i>Hercule Poirot's Casebook</i> <b>BOTH</b> contain <b>ALL</b> of the Poirot short stories.\n    \n    Most of Book #38.1 \"The Under Dog and Other Stories\" stories can be found in book #38 \"Poirot's Early Cases\".\n    \n    Note that many books of Agatha Christie short stories contain a mixture of detectives. For example, <i>Problem at Pollensa Bay</i> contains 8 stories but only 2 feature Poirot.",

Then Llewelyn, Prince of North Wales, secures an uneasy truce with England by marrying the English king's beloved, illegitimate daughter, Joanna. Reluctant to wed her father's bitter enemy, Joanna slowly grows to love her charismatic and courageous husband who dreams of uniting Wales. But as John's attentions turn again and again to subduing Wales--and Llewelyn--Joanna must decide to which of these powerful men she owes her loyalty and love.<br />A sweeping novel of power and passion, loyalty and lives, this is the book that began the trilogy that includes FALLS THE SHADOW and THE RECKONING.",

    "description": "This book completes the splendid sequence of novels on the struggle between the independent Welsh Princes and the growing English strength which began with Here be Dragons, continued with Falls the Shadow and is now completed with The Reckoning. The major figures in The Reckoning are the splendid dominant King of England, Edward I, and The Great Llewellyn II, Prince of Wales. His long love affair and eventual marriage with Ellen, daughter of Simon De Montfort, provides the strong emotional interest in the book, while the political machinations of Edward against the Welsh and the Scots, together with Llewellyn's struggle to control the recalcitrant Welsh Princes provides the political and military drama.",

    "description": "No one better understands the desire to be bad than Elizabeth Wurtzel. <i>Bitch</i> is a brilliant tract on the history of manipulative female behavior. By looking at woman who derive their power from their sexuality, Wurtzel offers a trenchant cultural critique of contemporary gender relations. Beginning with Delilah, the first woman to supposedly bring a great man down (latter day Delilahs include Yoko Ono, Pam Smart, Bess Myerson), Wurtzel finds many biblical counterparts to the men and woman in today's headlines. In five brilliant extended essays, she links the lives of women as demanding and disparate as Amy Fisher, Hillary Clinton, Margaux Hemingway, and Nicole Brown Simpson. Wurtzel gives voice to these women whose lives have been misunderstood, who have been dismissed for their beauty, their madness, their youth. She finds in the story of Amy Fisher the tragic plight of all Lolitas, our thirst for their brief and intense flame. She connects Hemingway's tragic suicide to those of Sylvia Plath, Edie Sedgwick, and Marilyn Monroe, women whose beauty was an end, ultimately, in itself. Wurtzel, writing about the wife/mistress dichotomy, explains how some women are anointed as wife material, while others are relegated to the role of mistress. She takes to task the double standard imposed on women, the cultural insistence on goodness and society's complete obsession with badness: what's a girl to do? Let's face it, if women were any real threat to male power, \"Gennifer Flowers would be sitting behind the desk of the Oval Office,\" writes Wurtzel, \"and Bill Clinton would be a lounge singer in the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock.\"<br /><br /><i>Bitch</i> tells a tale both celebratory and cautionary as Wurtzel catalogs some of the most infamous women in history, defending their outsize desires, describing their exquisite loneliness, championing their take-no-prisoners approach to live and love. Whether writing about Courtney Love, Sally Hemmings, Bathsheba, Kimba Wood, Sharon Stone, Princess Di-- or waxing eloquent on the hideous success of <i>The Rules,</i> the evil that is <i>The Bridges of Madison County,</i> the twisted logic of <i>You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again</i>-- Wurtzel is back with a bitchography that cuts to the core. In prose both blistering and brilliant, <i>Bitch</i> is a treatise on the nature of desperate sexual manipulation and a triumph of pussy power.",

    "description": "A\u00a0glorious novel of the controversial Richard III---a monarch betrayed in life by his allies and betrayed in death by history<br /><br />In this beautifully rendered modern classic, Sharon Kay Penman redeems Richard III---vilified as the bitter, twisted, scheming\u00a0hunchback who murdered his nephews, the princes in the Tower---from his maligned\u00a0place in history with a\u00a0dazzling combination of research and storytelling.\u00a0<br /><br />Born into\u00a0the treacherous courts of fifteenth-century\u00a0England, in the midst of what history has called The Wars of the Roses, Richard was raised in the shadow of his charismatic brother, King Edward IV. Loyal to his friends and passionately in love with the one woman who was denied him, Richard emerges as a gifted man far more sinned against than sinning.\u00a0<br /><br />This magnificent retelling of his life is filled with all of the sights and sounds of battle, the customs and lore of the fifteenth century, the rigors of court politics, and the passions and prejudices of royalty.",

    "description": "Vandana Shiva has established herself as a leading independent thinker and voice for the South in that critically important nexus where questions of development strategy, the environment and the posititon of women in society coincide. In this new volume, she brings together her thinking on the protection of biodiversity, the implications of biotechnology, and the consequences for agriculture of the global pre-eminence of Western-style scientific knowledge.<br /><br /> In lucid and accessible fashion, she examines the current threats to the planet's biodiversity and the environmental and human consequences of its erosion and replacement by monocultural production. She shows how the new Biodiversity Convention has been gravely undermined by a mixture of diplomatic dilution during the process of negotiation and Northern hi-tech interests making money out of the new biotechnologies. She explains what these technologies involve and gives examples of their impact in practice. She questions their claims to improving natural species for the good of all and highlights the ethical and environmental problems posed.<br /><br /> Underlying her arguments is the view that the North's particular approach to scientific understanding has led to a system of monoculture in agriculture - a model that is not being foisted on the South, displacing its societies' ecologically sounder, indigenous and age-old experiences of truly sustainable food cultivation, forest management and animal husbandry. This rapidly accelerating process of technology and system transfer is impoverishing huge numbers of people, disrupting the social systems that provide them with security and dignity, and will ultimately result in a sterile planet in both North and South, In a policy intervention of potentially great significance, she calls instead for a halt, at international as well as local level, to the aid and market incentives to both large-scale destruction of habitats where biodiversity thrives and the introduction of centralised, homogenous systems of cultivation.",

    "description": "In the turbulent years of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, three poets--Byron, Shelley, and Keats--come to prominence, famous and infamous, for their vivid personalities, and their glamorous, shocking, and sometimes tragic lives. In this electrifying novel, those lives are explored through the eyes of the women who knew and loved them--intensely, scandalously.<br /><br />Four women from widely different backgrounds are linked by a sensational fate. Mary Shelley: the gifted daughter of gifted parents, for whom passion leads to exile, loss, and a unique fame. Lady Caroline Lamb: born to fabulous wealth and aristocratic position, who risks everything for the ultimate love affair. Fanny Brawne: her quiet, middle-class girlhood is transformed--and immortalized--by a disturbing encounter with genius. Augusta Leigh: the unassuming poor relation who finds herself flouting the greatest of all taboos.<br /><br />With the originality, richness, and daring of the poets themselves, <i>Passion</i> presents the Romantic generation in a new and unforgettable light.<br />",

    "description": "The acclaimed author of Aristocrats returns with a major new book that reveals the story of a regal family plagued by scandal and notoriety and trapped by duty, desire, and the protocols of royalty.<br />History remembers King George III of England as the mad monarch who lost America. But as a young man, this poignant figure set aside his own passions in favor of a temperate life as guardian to both his siblings and his country. <br /><br />He would soon learn that his prudently cultivated harmony would be challenged by the impetuous natures of his sisters and brothers, and by a changing world in which the very instituation of monarchy was under fire. <br />At the heart of Stella Tillyard's intimate and vivid account is King George's sister Caroline Mathilde. Married against her will at fifteen to the ailing king of Denmark, she broke all the rules by embarking on an affair with a radical young court doctor. <br /><br />Their rash experiment in free living ended in imprisonment, death, and exile and almost led their two countries to war. Around this tragedy are woven the stories of King George's scandalous brothers, who squandered their time and titles partying and indulging in disastrous relationships that the gossip-hungry press was all too delighted to report. <br />Historians have always been puzzled by George's refusal to give up on America, which forced his government to drag out the Revolutionary War long after it was effectively lost. <br /><br />Tillyard suggests that the king, seeing the colonists as part of his family, sought to control them in the same way he had attempted to rule his younger siblings. <br />In this brilliantly interpretive biography, Stella Tillyard conjures up a Georgian world of dynastic marriages, headstrong royals, and radical new ideas. <br /><br />A compelling story of private passions and public disgrace, rebellion and exile, \"A Royal Affair\" brings to life the dramatic events that served as a curtain-raiser to the revolutions that convulsed two continents.",

    "description": "The role that won Zakes Mokae a Tony Award brought Danny Glover back to the New York stage for the Roundabout Theatre's revival of this searing coming of age story, considered by many to be Fugard's masterpiece. A white teen who has grown up in the affectionate company of the two black waiters who work in his mother's tea room in Port Elizabeth learns that his viciously racist alcoholic father is on his way home from the hospital. An ensuing rage unwittingly triggers his inevitable passage into the culture of hatred fostered by apartheid.<br /><br />\"One of those depth charge plays [that] has lasting relevance [and] can triumphantly survive any test of time...The story is simple, but the resonance that Fugard brings to it lets it reach beyond the narrative, to touch so many nerves connected to betrayal and guilt. An exhilarating play...It is a triumph of playmaking, and unforgettable.\"-New York Post<br /><br />\"Fugard creates a blistering fusion of the personal and the political.\"-The New York Times<br /><br />\"This revival brings out [the play's] considerable strengths.\"-New York Daily News",

    "description": "Eckhart Tolle's message is simple: living in the now is the truest path to happiness and enlightenment. And while this message may not seem stunningly original or fresh, Tolle's clear writing, supportive voice and enthusiasm make this an excellent manual for anyone who's ever wondered what exactly \"living in the now\" means. Foremost, Tolle is a world-class teacher, able to explain complicated concepts in concrete language. More importantly, within a chapter of reading this book, readers are already holding the world in a different container--more conscious of how thoughts and emotions get in the way of their ability to live in genuine peace and happiness.<p>Tolle packs a lot of information and inspirational ideas into <i>The Power of Now</i>. (Topics include the source of Chi, enlightened relationships, creative use of the mind, impermanence and the cycle of life.) Thankfully, he's added markers that symbolise \"break time\". This is when readers should close the book and mull over what they just read. As a result, <i>The Power of Now</i> reads like the highly acclaimed <i>A Course in Miracles</i>--a spiritual guidebook that has the potential to inspire just as many study groups and change just as many lives for the better. --<i>Gail Hudson</i></p>",

On subjects ranging from the vanishing American pool hall, family vacations, and the art of being a bitch, to the role of today's actor, his celebrated contemporaries and predecessors, and his undying commitment to the theater, David Mamet's concise style, lean dialogue, and gut-wrenching honesty give us a unique view of the world as he sees it.",

    "description": "Fifty years after Jetty Paerl took to the Lugano stage and burst into 'The Birds of Holland', the Eurovision Song Contest is still luring 450 million of us to the sofa on that special Saturday night in May. But where once we settled down to admire the 'top-quality original songwriting' that the contest was inaugurated to showcase, throughout the long post-ABBA decades Eurovision has come to entertain us for all the wrong reasons: we chortle at its magnificent foolishness, its stubborn reinforcement of the crudest national stereotypes, at a scoreboard shamelessly corrupted by cross-border friendship and hatred. And as post-modern connoisseurs of showbiz meltdown, our focus has shifted from the blandly competent winners to the spangled, hapless, table-propping losers, those left to wander the lonely, windswept summit of Mount Fiasco. The gold standard of farcical failure, the benchmark of badness, to score nul points is to suffer international ignominy and find sympathetic understanding replaced by brutal guffaws. Remorseful of his own longstanding contributions to the latter chorus, yet darkly fascinated with those lives shadowed by the entertainment world's most grandiose humiliation, Tim Moore sets off to track down the thirteen Eurominstrels who have come and gone without troubling the scorers since Norway's Jahn Teigen twanged his silver braces and leapt splay-legged off the Palais des Congres stage in 1978. From Lisbon to Lithuania, from the Black Sea to the Baltic, Moore travels the continent to hear their extraordinary stories - 'poignant, ludicrous and heartwarming in almost equal measure' - recounting as he does so the no less improbable history of Eurovision itself, a towering cathedral of cheese that can nonetheless claim responsibility for keeping Norway out of the EU and catalysing the overthrow of a Portuguese dictatorship.",

    "description": "This manual-style book instantly dives into Eckhart Tolle's principles of \"living in the moment,\" which could be a jarring experience for readers who haven't read his preceding book, <i>The Power of Now</i>. For the initiated, though, this makes an excellent companion guide--rich in exercises and meditations to help readers get out of their minds so they can live more peacefully in their bodies. Sometimes it's hard to fathom what on earth Tolle is talking about: \"To regain awareness of Being and to abide in that state of 'feeling-realization' is enlightenment.\" Be patient. All concepts will be revealed (or at least more carefully explained). Ultimately, Tolle leads readers into a new form of thinking (or actually <i>not thinking</i>) that erases the consuming habits of waiting, worrying, and being in fear. The first step is ending the \"delusion of time.\" He asks, \"Are you always trying to get somewhere other than where you are? ... Is most of your doing just a means to an end?\" If so, Tolle has a book full of advice for you. As simplistic as this may sound, Tolle's work has spiritual merit and depth, especially for frantic Westerners who find their lives diminished by packed schedules and busy-ness. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>",

    "description": "It's a summer of sizzling heat in Charlotte where Dr. Temperance Brennan, forensic anthropologist for the North Carolina medical examiner, looks forward to her first vacation in years. A romantic vacation. She's almost out the door when the bones start appearing. <br /> A newborn's charred remains turn up in a woodstove. A small plane crashes in a North Carolina cornfield on a sunny afternoon. Both pilot and passenger are burned beyond recognition. And what is the mysterious black substance covering the bodies? Most puzzling of all are the bones discovered at a remote farm outside Charlotte. The remains seem to be of animal origin, but Tempe is shocked when she gets them to her lab. <br /> With help from a special detective friend, Tempe must investigate a poignant and terrifying case that comes at the worst possible moment. Daughter Katy has a new boyfriend who Tempe fears may have something to hide. And important personal decisions face Tempe. Is it time for emotional commitment? Will she have the chance to find out? <br /> Everything must wait on the bones. Why are the X rays and DNA so perplexing? Who is trying to keep Tempe from the answers? Someone is following her and Katy. That someone must be stopped before it's too late.",

Coming up against a homicide cop who is convinced the dead have been entombed on the site for centuries, Tempe perseveres, even with her own relationship with Detective Andrew Ryan at a delicate turning point. In the lab, the clean, well-perserved bones offer few clues. But when Carbon 14 confirms her hunch that these were recent deaths despite the antique buttons found near the bodies, Tempe's probing must produce answers quickly to stop a killer whose grisly handiwork has seen the light of day.",

    "description": "<b>The key to a modern murder lies in the sands of history.</b> <br /><br /> Examining a badly decomposed corpse is de rigueur for forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan. But puzzling damage on the body of a shooting victim, an Orthodox Jewish man, suggests this is no ordinary Montreal murder. When a stranger slips Tempe a photograph of a skeleton unearthed at an archaeological site, Tempe uncovers chilling ties between the dead man and secrets long buried in the dust of Israel. Traveling there with Detective Andrew Ryan, Tempe plunges into an international mystery as old as Jesus, and centered on the controversial discovery of Christ's tomb. Has a mastermind lured her into an elaborate hoax? If not, Tempe may be on the brink of rewriting two thousand years of history -- if she can survive the foes dead set on burying her.",

C'est l'histoire d'une province \u00e9troite, d\u00e9vote et bourgeoise. C'est, aussi, l'histoire du roman fran\u00e7ais. Rien, dans ce tableau, n'avait de quoi choquer la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Second Empire. Mais, inexorable comme une trag\u00e9die, flamboyant comme un drame, mordant comme une com\u00e9die, le livre s'\u00e9tait donn\u00e9 une arme redoutable : le style. Pour ce vrai crime, Flaubert se retrouva en correctionnelle. Aucun roman n'est innocent : celui-l\u00e0 moins qu'un autre. Lire <i>Madame Bovary</i>, au XXIe si\u00e8cle, c'est affronter le scandale que repr\u00e9sente une \u0153uvre aussi sinc\u00e8re qu'imp\u00e9rieuse. Dans chacune de ses phrases, Flaubert a vers\u00e9 une dose de cet arsenic dont Emma Bovary s'empoisonne : c'est un livre offensif, corrosif, dont l'ironie outrage toutes nos valeurs, et la litt\u00e9rature m\u00eame, qui ne s'en est jamais vraiment remise.",

    "description": "It is 1950 and, after a disastrous honeymoon night, Ariah Erskine's young husband throws himself into the roaring waters of Niagara Falls. Ariah, \"the Widow Bride of the Falls,\" begins a relentless seven-day vigil in the mist, waiting for his body to be found. At her side is confirmed bachelor and pillar of the community Dirk Burnaby, who is unexpectedly drawn to this plain, strange woman. What follows is a passionate love affair, marriage, and family--a seemingly perfect existence. But the tragedy by which they were thrown together begins to shadow them, damaging their idyll with distrust, greed, and even murder. <br /><br />Set against the mythic-historic backdrop of Niagara Falls in the mid-twentieth century, this haunting exploration of the American family in crisis is a stunning achievement from \"one of the great artistic forces of our time\" (<i>The Nation</i>).",

The text of the original has been revised throughout to take account of the enormous amount of new research following publication of the first edition. The introduction discusses the history of literacy up to the present day; the guide to further reading brings together over 300 new titles up to 1992. In this second edition there are substantially new sections on bureaucracy, sacred books, writing materials, the art of memory, ways of reading (particularly for women), the writing of French, and the relationship of script, imagery and seals.",

    "description": "After Mario Puzo wrote his internationally acclaimed The Godfather, he has often been imitated but never equaled. Puzo's classic novel, The Sicilian, stands as a cornerstone of his work--a lushly romantic, unforgettable tale of bloodshed, justice, and treachery. . . .<br /><br />The year is 1950. Michael Corleone is nearing the end of his exile in Sicily. The Godfather has commanded Michael to bring a young Sicilian bandit named Salvatore Guiliano back with him to America. But Guiliano is a man entwined in a bloody web of violence and vendettas. In Sicily, Guiliano is a modern day Robin Hood who has defied corruption--and defied the Cosa Nostra. Now, in the land of mist-shrouded mountains and ancient ruins, Michael Corleone's fate is entwined with the dangerous legend of Salvatore Guiliano: warrior, lover, and the ultimate Siciliano.",

Mario Puzo envisioned it all in his eerily prescient 1991 novel, <i>The Fourth K</i>.<br /><br /></b>President Francis Xavier Kennedy is elected to office, in large part, thanks to the legacy of his forebears\u2013 good looks, privilege, wealth\u2013and is the very embodiment of youthful optimism. Too soon, however, he is beaten down by the political process and, disabused of his ideals, he becomes a leader totally unlike what he has been before.<br /><br /> When his daughter becomes a pawn in a brutal terrorist plot, Kennedy, who has obsessively kept alive the memory of his uncles\u2019 assassinations, activates all his power to retaliate in a series of violent measures. As the explosive events unfold, the world and those closest to him look on with both awe and horror.",

    "description": "<b>The Barnes &amp; Noble Review</b><br /><br />After a visit to the Vatican in 1983, Mario Puzo, bestselling author of <a href=\"http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0451167716\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n  <i>The Godfather</i>\n</a> and <a href=\"http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0345432401\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n  <i>Omerta</i>\n</a>, \"was so enchanted by the look, the feel and food of Italy, so taken by its history,\" Carol Gino explains, \"that he wanted to write a novel about it.\" Nearly 20 years in the making, <i>The Family</i> is that novel.<br /><p>Set in Rome in the last years of the 15th century, Puzo's final book (completed by Gino, his companion for many years) is an absorbing, highly entertaining, fictional account of the rise and rule -- and eventual fall -- of that notorious first family of dysfunction during the Renaissance, the Borgias. Fast-paced and well researched, <i>The Family</i> -- in its effort to make such scandalous characters as the Borgias more human -- may well be the most ambitious novel of Puzo's career.</p><br /><p>Cardinal Roderigo Borgia is charismatic and handsome, a born leader and a perfidious man of the cloth who ascends to the papacy as Pope Alexander VI in 1492, when Italian city-states are competing for land and the Vatican is competing for souls. He is also the loving father of four children, two of whom become pawns in their father's implacable drive for power. Cesare, Roderigo's oldest son, grows from an insecure cardinal to a fierce military leader; and Lucrezia, Roderigo's beautiful, seductive daughter -- and her father's favorite (not to mention her brother's incestuous bedmate) -- becomes the marriage link that unites nations and divides hearts. Throughout Roderigo's wheeling and dealing, the Renaissance is in full swing as religion competes against humanism and the Church seeks autonomous control of what will one day become a united Italy. As in E. L. Doctrow's <a href=\"http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0452279070\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Ragtime</i></a> and Glen David Gold's <a href=\"http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0786867345\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Carter Beats the Devil</i></a>, historical figures pepper the narrative. Michelangelo, Machiavelli, Leonardo da Vinci (whose military inventions help Cesare kick some serious tail), and Ferdinand and Isabella all make guest appearances, though at times they seem more like window dressing than actual characters.</p><br /><p>While this blood-is-thicker-than-water tale is more summative than explorative (you don't really get into the heads of the Borgias as well as you do the Corleones), Puzo still knows how to tell a good story. <i>The Family</i> is an energetic novel, filled with enthusiasm and affection for the subject matter and the characters. Puzo's swan song may not be his finest work, but it is a robust, passionate love letter to a land, a history, and a culture that defined him as a writer and a man. <i>(Stephen Bloom)</i></p>",

    "description": "Genly Ai is an emissary from the human galaxy to Winter, a lost, stray world. His mission is to bring the planet back into the fold of an evolving galactic civilization, but to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own culture and prejudices and those that he encounters. On a planet where people are of no gender--or both--this is a broad gulf indeed. The inventiveness and delicacy with which Le Guin portrays her alien world are not only unusual and inspiring, they are fundamental to almost all decent science fiction that has been written since. In fact, reading Le Guin again may cause the eye to narrow somewhat disapprovingly at the younger generation: what new ground are they breaking that is not already explored here with greater skill and acumen? It cannot be said, however, that this is a rollicking good story. Le Guin takes a lot of time to explore her characters, the world of her creation, and the philosophical themes that arise.<p> If there were a canon of classic science fiction, <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> would be included without debate. Certainly, no science fiction bookshelf may be said to be complete without it. But the real question: is it fun to read? It is science fiction of an earlier time, a time that has not worn particularly well in the genre. <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> was a groundbreaking book in 1969, a time when, like the rest of the arts, science fiction was awakening to new dimensions in both society and literature. But the first excursions out of the pulp tradition are sometimes difficult to reread with much enjoyment. Rereading <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i>, decades after its publication, one feels that those who chose it for the Hugo and Nebula awards were right to do so, for it truly does stand out as one of the great books of that era. It is immensely rich in timeless wisdom and insight.</p><p> <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> is science fiction for the thinking reader, and should be read attentively in order to properly savor the depth of insight and the subtleties of plot and character. It is one of those pleasures that requires a little investment at the beginning, but pays back tenfold with the joy of raw imagination that resonates through the subsequent 30 years of science fiction storytelling. Not only is the bookshelf incomplete without owning it, so is the reader without having read it. <i>--L. Blunt Jackson</i></p>",

    "description": "As soon as Anne Shirley arrived at the snug, white farmhouse called Green Gables, she knew she wanted to stay forever...but would the Cuthberts send her back to the orphanage? Anne knows she's not what they expected\u2014a skinny girl with decidedly red hair and a temper to match. If only she could convince them to let her stay, she'd try very hard not to keep rushing headlong into scrapes or blurt out the very first thing she had to say. Anne was not like anybody else, everyone at Green Gables agreed; she was special\u2014a girl with an enormous imagination. This orphan girl dreamed of the day when she could call herself Anne of Green Gables<br /><br />The illustrations for this series were created by Scott McKowen, who, with his wife Christina Poddubiuk, operates Punch &amp; Judy Inc., a company specializing in design and illustration for theater and performing arts. Their projects often involve research into the visual aspects of historical settings and characters. Christina is a theater set and costume designer and contributed advice on the period clothing for the illustrations.<br /><br />Scott created these drawings in scratchboard \u00ad an engraving medium which evokes the look of popular art from the period of these stories. Scratchboard is an illustration board with a specifically prepared surface of hard white chalk. A thin layer of black ink is rolled over the surface, and lines are drawn by hand with a sharp knife by scraping through the ink layer to expose the white surface underneath. The finished drawings are then scanned and the color is added digitally.<br /><br />One thing\u2019s for certain, no house that Anne\u2019s in will ever be dull.\u201d That\u2019s what Marilla Cuthbert says about Anne, the lively red-headed orphan she and her brother Matthew adopt. For decades, girls have agreed, eagerly reading every book in Lucy Maud Montgomery\u2019s series that chronicles Anne\u2019s coming of age.<br />",
