    "description": "Pecola Breedlove, a young black girl, prays every day for beauty. Mocked by other children for the dark skin, curly hair, and brown eyes that set her apart, she yearns for normalcy, for the blond hair and blue eyes that she believes will allow her to finally fit in.Yet as her dream grows more fervent, her life slowly starts to disintegrate in the face of adversity and strife. A powerful examination of our obsession with beauty and conformity, Toni Morrison's virtuosic first novel asks powerful questions about race, class, and gender with the subtlety and grace that have always characterized her writing.<br />(back cover)",

Spurned by his wife at home and by superiors at work, Earl Summerfield hunkers down in his cramped San Francisco apartment and keeps a diary that is a scratched record of a world going to pieces. The words he overhears, the words he wants to say, swim in his head, turning into fantasies of ambition, love, and retribution. He is sorry for himself. He is angry at everyone. He takes to going out at night, slipping into other people's houses. He is looking for something, and he fixes on one woman.",

    "description": "For those sick of corporate scandals and underhanded business practices, laughter may be the best medicine. A hilarious parody of the classic bestseller <i>Who Moved My Cheese</i>, <i>Who Stole My Cheese?!!</i> offers a little lift in an otherwise challenging situation. Inside is an insipid tale that reveals profound truths about greed. It's a cloying yet inspiring story of four small characters -- two rats and two \"loyal employees\" -- who are trapped in a \"maze\" and looking for their share of the \"cheese\" to sustain them and bring them happiness.",

The author reminisces about a day when his plane was forced down in the Sahara, a thousand miles from help. There he encountered a most extraordinary small-person. If you please, said the stranger, draw me a sheep. And thus begins the remarkable story of the Little Prince, whose strange history he learned, bit by bit, in the days that followed. There are few stories that in some way, in some degree, change the world forever for their readers. This is one.Antoine de Saint-Exupe ry (1900-1944) was the author of numerous books on the subject of aviation, many of which have become classics of French and world literature.",

    "description": "When cartoonist Bill Watterson announced that his phenomenally popular cartoon strip would be discontinued, <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> fans throughout the world went into mourning. Fans have learned to survive -- despite the absence of the boy and his tiger in the daily newspaper. <i>It's a Magical World</i> delivers all the satisfaction of visiting its characters once more. Calvin fans will be able to see their favorite mischief maker stir it up with his furry friend, long-suffering parents, classmate Susie Derkins, school teacher Miss Wormwood, and Rosalyn the baby-sitter. <i>It's a Magical World</i> includes full-color Sundays and has it all: Calvin-turned-firefly waking Hobbes with his flashlight glow; courageous Spaceman Spiff rocketing through alien galaxies as he battles Dad-turned-Bug-Being; and Calvin's always inspired snowman art. There's no better way for Watterson fans to savor again the special qualities of their favorite strip.",

Ike Tucker has come to look for his missing sister and for the three men who may have murdered her. In that place of gilded surfers and sun-bleached blondes, Ike's search takes him on a journey through a twisted world of crazed Vietnam vets, sadistic surfers, drug dealers, and mysterious seducers. Ike looks into the shadows and finds parties that drift towards pointless violence, joyless vacations and highs you might never come down from ... and a sea of old hatreds and dreams gone bad. And if he's not careful, his is a journey from which he will never return.",

    "description": "From the author who brought you <b>Spin Cycle</b> and <b>Neurotica</b> comes a hilarious new novel about falling in love, hating your job, and getting what you want out of life---without ever mussing your lipstick!<br /><br />When it comes to men, beauty columnist Rebecca Fine always seems to be on the scruffy end of the mascara wand. But all that changes the morning she meets Max Stoddart, her new colleague at the <i>Daily Vanguard</i>. With his upscale suit, Hugh Grant hair, and obscenely sexy good looks, he\u2019s a single woman\u2019s dream come true. Finally, her grandmother can stop surfing the Net for eligible Jewish males. But is Max the catch of the decade---or just a major babe magnet? <br /><br />Meanwhile, Rebecca\u2019s old high school nemesis has resurfaced, a former blond bombshell called Lipstick who is now engaged to Rebecca\u2019s widowed dad. And it\u2019s good-bye to articles on toe cleavage when a hot tip sweeps Rebecca to the center of the Paris cosmetics world, where a miracle anti-wrinkle cream is about to be launched. That is, until she blows the whistle on a scandal that could set the beauty business---and the future of world peace---reeling. Will Rebecca win the recognition---not to mention the Pulitzer---she yearns for...and get the man of her dreams? Stay tuned.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",

    "description": "The virus kills nine out of ten of its victims. Its effects are so quick and so gruesome that even biohazard experts are terrified. It is airborne, it is extremely contagious, and it is about to burn through the suburbs of Washington, D.C. Is there any way to stop it? <br />This doomsday scenario confronted a biohazard SWAT team struggling in secret to stop the outbreak of an exotic \"hot\" virus at an Army research facility outside Washington. \"The Hot Zone\" tells the dramatic story of their dangerous race against time, along with an alarming account of how previously unknown viruses that have lived undetected in the rain forest for eons are now entering human populations. <br />From the airlocked confines of a biosafety level 4 military lab, to an airliner over Kenya carrying a passenger dissolving into a human virus bomb, to a deserted jungle cave alive with deadly virus, THE HOT ZONE is a non-fiction thriller like no other. \"The Andromeda Strain\" was fiction--- \"this is real!\"",

    "description": "Louise C. wants what Jackie O had ...<br /><br />Unhappy with her looks, her life, and her empty marriage, Louise Canova needs help -- and she finds it in a secondhand bookstore. A forty-year-old encyclopedia of style titled <em>Elegance</em>, this slim volume by formidable French fashion expert Madame Dariaux promises to transform even the plainest of women into creatures of poise and grace. It is a fairy godmother in print, an A-to-Z manual with essential advice that Louise vows to take to heart. But within its pages lie not only clues from her past, but also powerful lessons for the future. And as the old Louise gives way to the stunning new, she's about to find out that there's more to every life than what appears on the surface ... and that everything, even elegance, has its price.",

    "description": "The Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning author of All Over but the Shoutin\u2019 continues his personal history of the Deep South with an evocation of his mother\u2019s childhood in the Appalachian foothills during the Great Depression, and the magnificent story of the man who raised her.<br /><br />Charlie Bundrum was a roofer, a carpenter, a whiskey-maker, a fisherman who knew every inch of the Coosa River, made boats out of car hoods and knew how to pack a wound with brown sugar to stop the blood. He could not read, but he asked his wife, Ava, to read him the paper every day so he would not be ignorant. He was a man who took giant steps in rundown boots, a true hero whom history would otherwise have beem overlooked.<br /><br />In the decade of the Great Depression, Charlie moved his family twenty-one times, keeping seven children one step ahead of the poverty and starvation that threatened them from every side. He worked at the steel mill when the steel was rolling, or for a side of bacon or a bushel of peaches when it wasn\u2019t. He paid the doctor who delivered his fourth daughter, Margaret -- Bragg\u2019s mother -- with a jar of whiskey. He understood the finer points of the law as it applied to poor people and drinking men; he was a banjo player and a buck dancer who worked off fines when life got a little sideways, and he sang when he was drunk, where other men fought or cussed. He had a talent for living.<br /><br />His children revered him. When he died, cars lined the blacktop for more than a mile.<br /><br />Rick Bragg has built a soaring monument to the grandfather he never knew -- a father who stood by his family in hard times and left a backwoods legend behind -- in a book that blazes with his love for his family, and for a particular stretch of dirt road along the Alabama-Georgia border. A powerfully intimate piece of American history as it was experienced by the working people of the Deep South, a glorious record of a life of character, tenacity and indomitable joy and an unforgettable tribute to a vanishing culture, Ava\u2019s Man is Rick Bragg at his stunning best.",

    "description": "In <i>Jean de Florette and Manon of the Springs</i>, Marcel Pagnol (called by Andre Malraux \"one of the great writers of our generation\" and by Jean Renoir \"the leading film artist of his age\") achieves the fullest and most satisfying expression of a story that haunted him for years, a Provencal legend of vengeance exacted by a mysterious sheperdess. Pagnol brings to his treatment of this powerful, moving story his dramatist's sense of place, ambience, and character and his keen understanding of the Provencal countryside and its people. Rich with twists and ramifications, <i>Jean de Florette and Manon of the Springs</i> sets an idealistic city man against two secretive and deceitful Provencal country men in a superbly realized story of a struggle for life, of crime and punishment, of betrayal and revenge, and of judgment and forgiveness. In this edition, illustrated with images from the acclaimed film adaptation by Claude Berri, North Point presents Pagnol's enduring story in W.E. van Heyningen's exact and sensitive translation.<br /><br />Biblical in its cadences, epic in its sweep to destiny, and old fashioned in development of character and plot, this saga charts the destruction of a Provencal family.",

    "description": "Winner of the Pulitzer Prize<br />Movie Tie-in Edition<br /><br />When All the King's Men was first published in 1946, Sinclair Lewis pronounced it \"massive, impressive...one of our few national galleries of character.\" Diana Trilling, reviewing it for the Nation, wrote, \"For sheer virtuosity, for the sustained drive of its prose, for the speed and the evenness of its pacing, for its precision of language...I doubt indeed whether it can be matched in American fiction.\" The Washington Post declared, \"If the game of naming the Great American Novel is still being played anywhere, Warren's All the King's Men would easily make the final rounds.\" <br /><br />Set in the 1930s, this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel traces the rise and fall of demagogue Willie Stark, a fictional character who resembles the real-life Huey \"Kingfish\" Long of Louisiana. Stark begins his political career as an idealistic man of the people but soon becomes corrupted by success and caught between dreams of service and an insatiable lust for power. As relevant today as it was more than fifty years ago, All the King's Men is one of the classics of American literature.<br />",

And Will, senior class president, quarterback, and all-around good guy. <p>But not everybody at Avalon High is who they appear to be ... not even, as new student Ellie is about to discover, herself. What part does she play in the drama that is unfolding? What if the bizarre chain of events and coincidences she has pieced together means -- as with the court of King Arthur -- tragedy is fast approaching Avalon High?</p> <p>Worst of all, what if there's nothing she can do about it?</p>",

    "description": "Neal Pollack has been the Greatest Living American Writer across six decades, seven continents, and ten wives. He has won the Pulitzer Prize, the Booker Prize, the PEN/Faulkner Award (twice), and the Premio Simon Bolivar for contributions to the people's struggle in Latin America. In 1985, Pollack's writing was declared \"beyond our meager standards\" by the Swedish Academy<br /><br />With the publication of <em>The Neal Pollack Anthology of American Literature,</em> the definitive collection of his work in English, a new generation of readers is set to discover nothing less than the ultimate meaning of human existence on earth. This astonishing work of fictitious nonfiction, the funniest and most creatively styled postmodernist confection of its time, has been universally praised as the best book ever written except for maybe <em>Don Quixote</em> and <em>The Shipping News</em>. The <em>Anthology</em> -- now expanded, updated, and thoroughly repaginated -- answers, once and for all, the question that has plagued American society in general, and literary critics in particular, since Neal Pollack was born: \"Who is Neal Pollack?\" At last, we know.",

From the prizewinning title story unfolds a series of family snapshots that illuminate the landscape of an exiled community rich in heritage, memory, and longing for the past. In Cuba I Was a German Shepherd is at once \"tender and sharp-fanged\" (L.A. Weekly) as Ana Menendez charts the territory from Havana to Coral Gables, exploring whether any of us are capable, or even truly desirous, of out running our origins.",

    "description": "Pennsbury High School would be like any other were it not for one thing: its prom. Its spring dance is considered to be one of this country's best legacies. Wonderland is the inspiring true story of a dance floor and the kids who fill it: a tale of hope, sex, love, and loss. For one year, the students, parents, and teachers of Pennsbury invited Michael Bamberger, a senior writer for Sports Illustrated, into their classrooms, their homes, their parties, and their dreams. He discovered an extraordinary and disparate group of everyday teenagers whose stories were touching, odd, funny, and beautiful.<br />In Wonderland, lives intersect in unpredictable ways and are never what they appear to be. The star quarterback hides the pain of not knowing where his father is. A student with cerebral palsy is desperate to learn to tie Eagle Scout knots, despite a useless left hand. And then there is Bob Costa, who dreams of bringing glory to the school by convincing John Mayer, whose song \"Your Body Is a Wonderland\" is an anthem for the students, to perform at the prom. Critically acclaimed in hardcover, Wonderland is published in paperback with a new afterword by the author.",

His companion, Mr. Shelby, had the appearance of a gentleman; and the arrangements of the house, and the general air of the housekeeping, indicated easy, and even opulent circumstances. As we before stated, the two were in the midst of an earnest conversation. \"That is the way I should arrange the matter,\" said Mr. Shelby. \"I can't make trade that way -- I positively can't, Mr. Shelby,\" said the other, holding up a glass of wine between his eye and the light. \"Why, the fact is, Haley, Tom is an uncommon fellow; he is certainly worth that sum anywhere, -- steady, honest, capable, manages my whole farm like a clock. Tom is a good, steady, sensible, pious fellow. He got religion at a camp-meeting, four years ago; and I believe he really did get it. I've trusted him, since then, with everything I have, -- money, house, horses, -- and let him come and go round the country; and I always found him true and square in everything.\" \"Some folks don't believe there is pious niggers Shelby,\" said Haley, with a candid flourish of his hand, \"but I do.\"",

    "description": "<p><strong>\"A family saga, a revenge fantasy, a <i>Twilight Zone</i>-esque parable, and, most importantly, a very fun read.\"\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201d<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></strong><br /><br />This story of two men locked in a war of wills that threatens their very existence is vintage Irvine Welsh. Troubled restaurant inspector Danny Skinner is on a quest to find the mysterious father his mother will not identify. Unraveling this hidden information is the key to understanding the crippling compulsions that threaten to wreck his young life. His ensuing journey takes him from the festival city of Edinburgh to the foodie city of San Francisco. But the hard-drinking, womanizing Skinner has a strange nemesis in the form of mild-mannered fellow inspector Brian Kibby.<br /><br />It is Skinner's unfathomable, obsessive hatred of Kibby that takes over everything, threatening to destroy not only Skinner and his mission but also those he loves most dearly. When Kibby contracts a horrific, undiagnosable illness, Skinner understands that his destiny is inextricably bound to that of his hated rival, and he is faced with a terrible dilemma.<br /><br />Irvine Welsh's work is a transgressive parable about the great obsessions of our time: food, sex, and celebrity.</p>",

    "description": "<i>Pygmalion</i> both delighted and scandalized its first audiences in 1914. A brilliantly witty reworking of the classical tale of the sculptor Pygmalion, who falls in love with his perfect female statue, it is also a barbed attack on the British class system and a statement of Shaw's feminist views. In Shaw's hands, the phoneticist Henry Higgins is the Pygmalion figure who believes he can transform Eliza Doolittle, a cockney flower girl, into a duchess at ease in polite society. The one thing he overlooks is that his 'creation' has a mind of her own. Adapted into the Oscar-winning musical film <i>My Fair Lady</i> starring Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison in 1964, <i>Pygmalion</i><br /><br />This is the definitive text produced under the editorial supervision of Dan H. Laurence, with an illuminating introduction by Nicholas Grene, discussing the language and politics of the play. Also included in this volume is Shaw's preface, as well as his 'sequel' written for the first publication in 1916, to rebut public demand for a more conventially romantic ending.<br />(back cover)",

But while Cat's colleagues know her as a world-class scientist, she secretly attempts to manage her fragile psyche with alcohol, delving into the minds of rapists and murderers yet never allowing her own frightening past to creep into the foreground.<br /><br />Cat's latest case involves a disturbing murder in New Orleans. Banishing her personal demons, she focuses on the potential killer, until one morning she's paralyzed by a panic attack at a grisly murder scene. Praying the attack is a onetime event, she continues her job as a consultant to the New Orleans Police Department, but when another victim dies in the same shocking way - raising fears that a serial killer is at large - Cat blacks out over the victim's mutilated corpse.<br /><br />Suspended from the FBI task force, plagued by nightmares, and at odds with her married lover - a homicide detective - Cat finally reaches her breaking point. In a desperate effort to regain control over a life spiraling out of control, Cat retreats to her hometown of Natchez, Mississippi. But her family's secluded antebellum estate provides no sanctuary. <br /><br />When some of Cat's forensic chemicals are spilled in her childhood bedroom, two bloody footprints are revealed. This sight shocks her more than any corpse she has seen in her career. Cat's father was murdered when she was eight years old, but she always believed the crime occurred in the garden outside their home. The bloody footprints suggest otherwise.<br /><br />Driven by this fragment of her past, Cat attempts a forensic reconstruction of the decades-old crime, even as developments with the New Orleans task force pull her back into the case she left behind. Plagued by troubling nightmares, Cat pieces together the horrifying events she has been shielded from all her life. Soon, both she and the FBI realize that the murders occurring now in New Orleans are intimately bound up with Cat's family and her past.<br /><br />Can Cat trust her own memories? Or has the truth been so distorted that she can never know her family's real history? Finding a solution to these intertwined murders means more than stopping a remorseless killer - it may be the only way to save Cat Ferry's sanity . . . and her life.<br /><br />Greg Iles is a masterful storyteller. In this dramatic novel of suspense he deftly probes the relationship between good and evil, and the unique power of human memory to reconstruct - or completely reinvent - the past.",

    "description": "The popular Mary Kay Andrews delivers a tasty holiday treat as she brings back the winning characters from Savannah Blues and Savannah Breeze for a little Southern cheer.<br /><br />It's the week before Christmas, and antiques dealer Weezie Foley is in a frenzy to do up her shop for the Savannah historical district window decorating contest-which she intends to win. She throws herself into putting up a Graceland/Blue Christmas motif, with lots of tinsel, an aluminum tree, and all kinds of tacky retro stuff. The project takes up so much time that Weezie is ready to shoot herself with her glue gun by the time she's done, but the results are stunning. She's sure she's one-upped the owners of the trendy shop around the corner. But suddenly, things go missing from Weezie's display, and there seems to be a mysterious midnight visitor to her shop.<br /><br />Still, Weezie has high hopes for the holiday-maybe in the form of an engagement ring from her chef boyfriend. But Daniel, always moody at the holidays, seems more distant than usual.<br /><br />Throw in Weezie's decidedly odd family, a 1950s Christmas tree pin, and even a little help from the King himself, and maybe there will be a pocketful of miracles for Weezie this Christmas eve.",

But when Camilla Capybara joins Rodney's class and announces that she is bigger, meaner, and smarter than any of the other rodents, everyone is afraid. It seems she really is bigger, meaner, and smarter than all of the rest of them. Until our unwitting hero, Wodney Wat, catches Camilla out in a game of Simon Says. Read along with Wodney as he surprises himself and his classmates by single-handedly saving the whole class from the big bad bully. Children will delight as shy Rodney Rat triumphs over all and his tiny voice decides the day, R's or no R's.",

    "description": "A riveting and inspiring memoir about a couple who fell in love, fell apart, and finally overcame the pressures of fame, family, and Asperger's syndrome to build a life together.When Jerry and Mary Newport met, the connection was instant; neither had ever felt more comfortable. A musical genius and a mathematical wonder, the two shared astronomical IQs, but they also shared something else -- they both were diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism that affects millions of Americans and makes social contact painfully unbearable. Finding each other after a lifetime of loneliness was a miracle. When Jerry and Mary married, they were catapulted into the limelight. They appeared on <i>60 Minutes</i> and soon were known as \"superstars in the world of autism,\" shining examples of two people who refused to give up in the face of their mutual challenges.<br /><br />But just when it appeared that their lives would enjoy a fairy-tale ending, their marriage fell apart. The Hollywood feeding frenzy was too much to handle, and they divorced. After years of heartache, soul searching, and personal growth, Jerry and Mary remarried. Today, with their union stronger than ever, they have dedicated themselves to helping countless other people with Asperger's and autism lead lives of dignity. <i>Mozart and the Whale</i> is an unforgettable love story, the incredible chronicle of their journey together -- and apart.",

Natalie's mother is an editor for a big children's publisher, but Natalie doesn't want to ask for any favors.<br /><br /> Then Zoe has a brilliant idea: Natalie can submit her manuscript under a pen name, with Zoe acting as her literary agent. But it's not easy for two sixth graders to put themselves over as grown-ups, even with some help from a couple of <i>real</i> grown-ups who are supportive but skeptical. The next bestselling school story may be in their hands\u2014but can Natalie and Zoe pull off their masquerade?",

    "description": "<b>Newsbreaking and controversial -- an award-winning investigative journalist uncovers the thirty-year relationship between the Bush family and the House of Saud and explains its impact on American foreign policy, business, and national security.</b> <br /><i>House of Bush, House of Saud</i> begins with a politically explosive question: How is it that two days after 9/11, when U.S. air traffic was tightly restricted, 140 Saudis, many immediate kin to Osama Bin Laden, were permitted to leave the country without being questioned by U.S. intelligence? <br /> The answer lies in a hidden relationship that began in the 1970s, when the oil-rich House of Saud began courting American politicians in a bid for military protection, influence, and investment opportunity. With the Bush family, the Saudis hit a gusher -- direct access to presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush. To trace the amazing weave of Saud- Bush connections, Unger interviewed three former directors of the CIA, top Saudi and Israeli intelligence officials, and more than one hundred other sources. His access to major players is unparalleled and often exclusive -- including executives at the Carlyle Group, the giant investment firm where the House of Bush and the House of Saud each has a major stake. <br /> Like Bob Woodward's <i>The Veil,</i> Unger's <i>House of Bush, House of Saud</i> features unprecedented reportage; like Michael Moore's <i>Dude, Where's My Country?</i> Unger's book offers a political counter-narrative to official explanations; this deeply sourced account has already been cited by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer, and sets 9/11, the two Gulf Wars, and the ongoing Middle East crisis in a new context: What really happened when America's most powerful political family became seduced by its Saudi counterparts?",

With dire warnings of what will happen if baby is fed on demand and even direr warnings of what will happen if he isn't, not to mention hordes of militant \u201clactivists,\u201d cosleeping advocates, and books on what to worry about next, modern parenthood can seem like a minefield.<br /><br />In busy Mom-friendly short essays, <i>Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay</i> delivers the empathetic straight dirt on parenting, tackling everything from Mommy &amp; Me classes (\u201cYour baby doesn't need to be making friends at three months old\u2014you do! But not with people you'll meet at Mommy &amp; Me\u201d) to attachment parenting (\u201cIf you're holding your baby 24/7, that's not a baby, that's a tumor\u201d). Stefanie Wilder-Taylor combines practical tips with sidesplitting humor and refreshing honesty, assuring women that they can be good mothers and responsibly make their own choices. A witty and welcome antidote to trendy parenting texts and scarifying case studies, <i>Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay</i> provides genuine support, encouragement, and indispensable common-sense advice.",

    "description": "\"Speak up for yourself--we want to know what you have to say.\" From the first moment of her freshman year at Merryweather High, Melinda knows this is a big fat lie, part of the nonsense of high school. She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. Only her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. <br /><br />In Laurie Halse Anderson's powerful novel, an utterly believable heroine with a bitterly ironic voice delivers a blow to the hypocritical world of high school. She speaks for many a disenfranchised teenager while demonstrating the importance of speaking up for oneself.",

    "description": "'All the privilege I claim for my own sex...is that of loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.'. Anne Elliot's heartfelt words strike the keynote of Jane Austen's last completed novel. It features a heroine older and wiser than her predecessors in earlier books, and its tone is more intimate and sober as Jane Austen unfolds a simple love-story. She described her heroine in a letter as 'almost too good for me': Anne Elliot's goodness is not of the cloying kind, but an unsentimental quality that, combined with stoicism and integrity, enables her to find happiness in love after seven years when it seemed she had for ever put an end to such a prospect.",

From the unforgettable moment when a wild chimpanzee gently grasps her hand to the terror of a hostage-taking and the sorrow of her husband's death. Here, thoughtfully exploring the challenges of both science and the soul, she offers an inspiring, optimistic message as profound as the knowledge she brought back from the forests, and that gives us all...reason for hope.",

    "description": "<i>Possessing the Secret of Joy</i> is the story of Tashi, a tribal African woman who lives much of her adult life in North America. As a young woman, a misguided loyalty to the customs of her people led her to voluntarily submit to the tsunga's knife and be genitally mutilated (pharoanoically circumcised). Severely traumatized by this experience, she spends the rest of her life battling madness, trying desperately through psychotherapy - she is treated by disciples of both Freud and C.G. Jung, and even by Jung himself - to regain the ability to recognize her own reality and to feel. It is only with the help of the most unlikely ally she can imagine that she begins to study the mythological \"reasons\" invented by her ancient ancestors for what was done to her and to millions of other women and girls over thousands of years. As her understanding grows, so does her capacity to encounter her overwhelming grief. Underneath this grief is her glowing anger. Anger propels her to act. Action brings both feeling - life, the ability to exist with awareness in the moment - and death, of which she finds she has completely lost her fear.<br /><br />While not a sequel to <i>The Color Purple</i> or <i>The Temple of My Familiar</i>, <i>Possessing the Secret of Joy</i> follows the life of a barely-glimpsed character from those books. Combining fact and fiction, communing with the spirits of the living and the dead, Alice Walker in this novel strikes with graceful power at the heart of one of the most controversial issues of our time.",

In tracing the history of the Church from the time of Christ to the Great Persecution at the beginning of the fourth century, and ending with the conversion of the Emperor Constantine, his aim was to show the purity and continuity of the doctrinal tradition of Christianity and its struggle against persecutors and heretics.",

    "description": "Sherry Moore, a beautiful, blind psychic, has the extraordinary ability to 'see' the last eighteen seconds of a murder victim's life by touching the corpse. She uses her gift to help others solve mysteries only she can tap into. Serial killer Earl Sykes never got caught for his vicious murders. Instead, it was a deadly auto accident that landed him in prison. Now, years later, he is free and hungry for revenge. Setting his sights on Lieutenant Kelly O'Shaunisy, the daughter of his captor, he returns to his seaside hometown of Wildwood, New Jersey -- and to his gruesome, murderous ways.When Lieutenant O'Shaunisy begins to investigate the disappearance of young women from desolate areas of the boardwalk, she encounters frustrating dead-end clues and more deaths. Her desperation leads her to accept Sherry's help, but not without consequences. Together, the two women set out to discover the identity of the killer and become entangled in a dangerous web that could cost them their lives. With two memorable heroines, pulse-pounding suspense, and twists that will keep readers guessing until the last pages, \"18 Seconds\" introduces a powerful writing talent to the suspense scene.",

    "description": "Francis Fukuyama famously predicted \"the end of history\" with the ascendancy of liberal democracy and global capitalism. The topic of his latest book is, therefore, surprising: the building of new nation-states.<br /><br />The end of history was never an automatic procedure, Fukuyama argues, and the well-governed polity was always its necessary precondition. \"Weak or failed states are the source of many of the world's most serious problems,\" he believes. He traces what we know--and more often don't know--about how to transfer functioning public institutions to developing countries in ways that will leave something of permanent benefit to the citizens of the countries concerned. These are important lessons, especially as the United States wrestles with its responsibilities in Afghanistan, Iraq, and beyond.<br /><br />Fukuyama begins <em>State-Building</em> with an account of the broad importance of \"stateness.\" He rejects the notion that there can be a science of public administration, and discusses the causes of contemporary state weakness. He ends the book with a discussion of the consequences of weak states for international order, and the grounds on which the international community may legitimately intervene to prop them up.",

    "description": "BONUS FEATURE: Exclusive interview with the author.<br /><br />From one of the most beloved and bestselling authors in the English language, a vivid, nostalgic and utterly hilarious memoir of growing up in the middle of the United States in the middle of the last century. A book that delivers on the promise that it is \u201claugh-out-loud funny.\u201d<br /><br />Some say that the first hints that Bill Bryson was not of Planet Earth came from his discovery, at the age of six, of a woollen jersey of rare fineness. Across the moth-holed chest was a golden thunderbolt. It may have looked like an old college football sweater, but young Bryson knew better. It was obviously the Sacred Jersey of Zap, and proved that he had been placed with this innocuous family in the middle of America to fly, become invisible, shoot guns out of people\u2019s hands from a distance, and wear his underpants over his jeans in the manner of Superman.<br /><br />Bill Bryson\u2019s first travel book opened with the immortal line, \u201cI come from Des Moines. Somebody had to.\u201d In this hilarious new memoir, he travels back to explore the kid he once was and the weird and wonderful world of 1950s America. He modestly claims that this is a book about not very much: about being small and getting much larger slowly. But for the rest of us, it is a laugh-out-loud book that will speak volumes \u2013 especially to anyone who has ever been young.",

    "description": "<b>From the bestselling author of <i>Midwives</i> and <i>The Flight Attendant</i>, a comic and life affirming novel of the clash between progress and tradition, science and magic: \u201c</b><b>one of the most elegantly philosophical, urgent\u2014yet somehow timeless\u2014novels of these perilous times\u201d (Howard Norman, National Book Award finalist for <i>The Bird Artist</i>).</b><br /><br />Vermont is drying up. The normally lush, green countryside is in the grip of the worst drought in years: stunted cornstalks rasp in the hot July breeze, parched vegetable gardens wither and die, the Chittenden River shrinks to a trickle, and the drilling trucks are booked solid as one by one the wells give out. Patience Avery, known nationwide as a gifted \"water witch\", is having a busy summer, too. Using the tools of the dowser's trade \u2014divining sticks, metal rods, bobbers, and pendulums\u2014she can locate, among other things, aquifers deep within the earth. In the midst of this crisis, Scottie Winston lobbies for permits to expand Powder Peak, a local ski area that's his law firm's principal client. As part of the expansion, the resort seeks to draw water for snowmaking from the beleaguered Chittenden, despite opposition from environmentalists who fear that the already weakened river will be damaged beyond repair.",

    "description": "Cavemen Roam The Suburbs, Morality is questionable, teens are angsting, and alcoholics abound. This is the world as Stacey Richter sees it. In spite of--or perhaps because of--this alarming cast of characters, Richter's stories are infused with wit, humor, and keen observations of what makes humans tick. There is no sentimental hand-wringing about alcoholic or absentee parents, lost loves, or the most terrible suburban neighborhood Christmas displays. Richter's characters live, exist, play, and often drink too much because that is simply what they do. Carrying on is the only option. Richter writes with volatile energy, hurtling through her stories while coasting seamlessly between the regular and mundane. She sees the repercussions of bad parenting, forgotten kids, and while she may scoff, her caustic observations never demean her characters. By turns heartbreaking, mirthful, sardonic, and wise, her stories occasionally take a turn into the bizarre. Still, Richter's flights of fancy are not about whimsy or science fiction. They are one imaginative woman's clever and naked view of the absurdities teeming around her.",

    "description": "When Justine and Barry meet during a plane crash just before the Christmas holidays, the relationship that follows is wild, turbulent, and maybe, just maybe, a keeper. <br /> Justine is a pretty, smart, ambitious lawyer who's tired of being set up on lousy dates. Her eighteen-hour work days get in the way of finding Mr. Right, but she'd rather be home with her dog, drinking salad dressing for dinner and watching <i>The Sound of Music</i> on the VCR anyway. Barry is a good-looking food product manager living on the Upper West side with a rich roommate who is juggling three girlfriends at once but never has the rent. Barry seeks his soulmate, but the fact that he hasn't had a date in a year makes things a little tougher. <br /> A comic urban romance about the possibilities and impossibilities of love. <i>Was it Something I Said?</i> is a classic \"will they or won't they?\" for the nineties that will keep readers guessing until the very end.",

    "description": "Lauded by reviewers and scholars alike, Paul Blustein's <i>The Chastening</i> examines the role of the International Monetary Fund in the series of economic crises that rocked the globe in the last decade. Based on hundreds of interviews with officials at the IMF, the World Bank, the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the White House, and many foreign governments, <i>The Chastening</i> offers a behind-the-scenes look at the Fund during an extraordinarily turbulent period in modern economic history and at a time when the IMF has become the object of intense political controversy. <br /><br /> While the IMF and its overseers at the Treasury and the Fed have sought to cultivate an image of economic masterminds coolly dispensing effective economic remedies, the reality is that as markets were sinking and defaults looming, the guardians of global financial stability were often floundering, improvising, and feuding among themselves. <i>The Chastening</i> casts serious doubt on the IMF's ability to combat of investor panics at a time when massive flows of money traverse borders and oceans. <br /><br /> A readable, compelling account of the deeply flawed workings of the international political system, <i>The Chastening</i> is vital reading for students and scholars of international diplomacy, government, and economic and public policy.",

    "description": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>The Prize</i> joins a leading expert on the global economy to present an incisive narrative of the risks and opportunities that are emerging as the balance of power shifts around the world between governments and markets -- and the battle over globalization comes front and center.<br /><br />A brilliant narrative history, <i>The Commanding Heights </i>is about the most powerful economic forces at work in the world today, and about the people and the ideas that are shaping the future. Across the globe, it has become increasingly accepted dogma that economic activities should be dominated by market forces, not political concerns. With chapters on Europe, the US, Britain, the Third World, the Arab States, Asia, China, India, Latin America, and the former communist countries, Yergin and Stanislaw provide an incisive overview of the state of the economy, and of the battles between governments and markets in each region. Now updated throughout and with two new chapters, <i>The Commanding Heights</i> explains a revolution which is unfolding before our very eyes.",

    "description": "It has been said often enough that baby boomers are a television generation, but the very funny novel <i>High Fidelity</i> reminds that in a way they are the record-album generation as well. This funny novel is obsessed with music; Hornby's narrator is an early-thirtysomething English guy who runs a London record store. He sells albums recorded the old-fashioned way--on vinyl--and is having a tough time making other transitions as well, specifically adulthood. The book is in one sense a love story, both sweet and interesting; most entertaining, though, are the hilarious arguments over arcane matters of pop music.",

    "description": "Victor Hugo Les MisErables<br /><br />Translated by Charles E. Wilbour<br /><br />Abridged, edited and with an introduction by Paul Benichou<br /><br />Published simultaneously in nine languages in 1862, \"Les MiseRables\" is a vast tapestry set against the chaos of post-Napoleonic France. A cast of hundreds is woven into the epic story of the ex-convict Jean Valjean and his valiant struggle to redeem himself. A potent social document of the poverty, ignorance, and brutality of man, \"Les MiseRables\" is also a rousing adventure and a passionate parable of love. Here, Victor Hugo displays his skills as a dramatist and poet, and shows his deeply felt compassion for all mankind.<br /><br />Pocket Books' Enriched Classics present the great works of world literature enhanced for the contemporary reader. This edition of \"Les MiseRables\" contains the original introduction by Hugo scholar and Harvard professor Paul Benichou, as well as his accomplished abridgment.",

On the tiny island of St. Antoine, she tumbles into a corrupt world where no one is what they seem, where her rules for survival no longer apply. This is a thoroughly gripping novel of intrigue and betrayal, which explores human defensiveness, the lust for power both sexual and political, and the need for a compassion that goes beyond what we ordinarily mean by love. The enigma unfolds as it would for any innocent bystander swept up by events, bringing along the scruples, and the fears, of the past.<br />",

    "description": "<i>Leap of Faith</i> is the dramatic and inspiring story of an American woman's remarkable journey into the heart of a man and his nation. <br /><br />Born into a distinguished Arab-American family and raised amid privilege, Lisa Halaby joined the first freshman class at Princeton to accept women, graduating in 1974 with a degree in architecture and urban planning. Two years later, while visiting her father in Jordan, she was casually introduced on the airport runway to King Hussein. Widely admired in the Arab world as a voice of moderation, and for his direct lineage to the prophet Muhammad, Hussein would soon become the world's most eligible bachelor after the tragic death of his wife. The next time they met, Hussein would fall headlong in love with the athletic, outspoken daughter of his longtime friend. After a whirlwind, secret courtship Lisa Halaby became Noor Al Hussein, Queen of Jordan.<br /><br />With eloquence and candor, Queen Noor speaks of the obstacles she faced as a naive young bride in the royal court, of rebelling against the smothering embrace of security guards and palace life, and of her own successful struggle to create a working role as a humanitarian activist in a court that simply expected Noor to keep her husband happy. As she gradually took on the mantle of a queen, Noor's joys and challenges grew. After a heartbreaking miscarriage, she gave birth to four children. Meshing the demands of motherhood with the commitments of her position often proved difficult, but she tried to keep her young children by her side, even while flying the world with her husband in his relentless quest for peace. This mission would reap satisfying rewards, including greater Arab unity and a peace treaty with Israel, and suffer such terrible setbacks as the Gulf War and the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin.<br /><br /><i>Leap of Faith</i> is a remarkable document. It is the story of a young American woman who became wife and partner to an Arab monarch. It provides a compelling portrait of the late King Hussein and his lifelong effort to bring peace to his war-torn region, and an insider's view of the growing gulf between the United States and the Arab nations. It is also the refreshingly candid story of a mother coming to terms with the demands the king's role as a world statesman placed on her family's private life. But most of all it is a love story \u2014 the intimate account of a woman who lost her heart to a king, and to his people.",

    "description": "The Regency period was one of the most turbulent ages in British history, one that spanned the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, that witnessed unprecedented industrial progress, artistic accomplishment, and violent social unrest and--paradoxically--the most sparkling social scene English high society has ever enjoyed. Under the influence of the obese, loose-moraled Prince of Wales (to whom <b>Jane Austen</b> dedicated <b>Emma</b>), the Regency was the apex of British decadence, an era of lavish parties and relentless bed-hopping that set a standard for elegance and vulgarity. With wit and lively style, <b>Venetia Murray</b> chronicles the scandals, courtships, and daily life of these aristocrats, and evokes the tempestuous times of the early industrial and French revolutions. Sumptuously illustrated with rare contemporary cartoons, prints, diaries, and caricatures, <b>An Elegant Madness</b> is a book readers of social history and historical romance alike will devour.",

Written later, and probably abandoned after her father's death, <i>The Watsons</i> is a tantalizing and highly delightful story whose vitality and optimism centre on the marital prospects of the Watson sisters in a small provincial town. <i>Sanditon</i>, Jane Austen's last fiction, is set in a seaside town and its themes concern the new speculative consumer society and foreshadow the great social upheavals of the Industrial Revolution.</p>",

Innocuous remarks suddenly turn damning. Socratic dialogue gives way to heated assault. And the relationship between a somewhat fatuous teacher and his seemingly hapless pupil turns into a fiendishly accurate X ray of the mechanisms of power, censorship, and abuse.",

    "description": "<br /><b>Inside an ordinary middle school in an ordinary city, a small redheaded eighth grader is doing something very ordinary, indeed.</b> <p> Ever since Charlotte Mielswetzski and her cousin, Zee, saved the world, life has been rather ordinary. Ordinary, that is, if you call being ultramegagrounded (in Charlotte's case) or treated as if you might fall to pieces (in Zee's case) ordinary. Either way, heroes deserve better. </p><p> Of course, no one knows Charlotte and Zee are heroes. It's not like they can simply announce that Greek myths are real or proclaim they have returned from the Underworld, where they rescued all of mankind from Philonecron, a deranged demigod with delusions of grandeur. Instead, they are forced to keep this terrible knowledge to themselves, and are stuck in a state of extraordinary ordinariness. </p><p> But things aren't quite as ordinary as they seem. For Philonecron is the grandson of Poseidon, and you don't mess with the progeny of the second most powerful god in the universe. And Philonecron himself isn't so happy about having all of his delicious plans thwarted by mortal children. He wants revenge, and with his grandfather to help him, he is going to get what he wants. </p><p> For Charlotte and Zee, their not-so-ordinary lives are about to be disrupted once again. This time it's not the world they must save -- it's themselves. </p><p> In the thrilling second installment of the Cronus Chronicles trilogy, author Anne Ursu brings her trademark wit to a spectacular adventure on the high seas.<br /></p>",

    "description": "Inspired by long fascination with Galileo &amp; the surviving letters of his daughter, a cloistered nun, Sobel has written a biography of the one Einstein called \"the father of modern physics--indeed of modern science altogether.\" <i>Galileo's Daughter</i> presents a portrait of a person hitherto lost to history, described by Galileo as \"a woman of exquisite mind, singular goodness &amp; most tenderly attached to me.\" <br /> Son of a musician, Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) tried at 1st to enter a monastery before engaging the skills that made him the foremost scientist of his day. Tho he never left Italy, his inventions &amp; discoveries were heralded round the world. Most sensationally, his telescopes allowed him to reveal a new reality in the heavens &amp; to reinforce the argument that the Earth moves round the Sun. For this belief, he was brought before the Holy Office of the Inquisition, accused of heresy &amp; forced to spend his last years under house arrest. <br /> Of Galileo's three illegitimate children, the eldest best mirrored his own brilliance, industry, &amp; sensibility, &amp; by virtue of such qualities became his confidante. Born Virginia in 1600, she was 13 when Galileo placed her in a convent near him in Florence, where she took the most appropriate name of Suor Maria Celeste. Her loving support, which Galileo repaid in kind, proved to be her father's greatest source of strength thru his most productive &amp; tumultuous years. Her presence, thru letters which Sobel has translated from their original Italian &amp; woven into the narrative, graces her father's life now as it did then.<br /><i>Galileo's Daughter</i> dramatically recolors the personality &amp; accomplishment of a mythic figure whose 17th-century clash with Catholic doctrine continues to define the schism between science &amp; religion. Moving between Galileo's grand public life &amp; Maria Celeste's sequestered world, Sobel illuminates the Florence of the Medicis &amp; the papal court in Rome during the pivotal era when humanity's perception of its place in the cosmos was about to be overturned. In that same time, while the bubonic plague wreaked its terrible devastation &amp; the 30 Years' War tipped fortunes across Europe, one man sought to reconcile the Heaven he revered as a good Catholic with the heavens he revealed thru a telescope. <br /> With all the drama &amp; scientific adventure that distinguished Dava Sobel's previous book <i>Longitude</i>, <i>Galileo's Daughter</i> is an unforgettable story.",

    "description": "<i>San Manuel Bueno, m\u00e1rtir</i>, obra maestra de Miguel de Unamuno, es considerada como su testamento espiritual. La novela muestra un espacio no descriptivo en el que se asientan los s\u00edmbolos clave de la dial\u00e9ctica entre fe y duda: el lago, la monta\u00f1a, la nieve, la villa sumergida, etc. San Manuel asume esta lucha y se convierte en m\u00e1rtir en tanto toma sobre s\u00ed la duda y la sufre por toda la comunidad que, sumida en el enga\u00f1o, avanza cohesionada por esa supuesta verdad no cuestionada. La fuerza del conflicto central (encarnaci\u00f3n de lo que en el siglo XX se llamar\u00eda la duda existencial, el silencio de Dios o la p\u00e9rdida de la fe) favorece la vigencia del libro, donde aparece tambi\u00e9n una amorosa, y muy actual, atenci\u00f3n al paisaje, dispuesto todo ello con gran sencillez compositiva, lo que facilita la lectura y justifica su presencia en cualquier colecci\u00f3n.",

    "description": "How did English, 'treated for centuries as the inadequate and second-rate tongue of peasants' become the undisputed global language? How did words like shampoo, sofa and rowdy (and others drawn from over fifty languages) find their way into our dictionary? In this revealing and often hilarious book, Bill Bryson examines the mother tongue and explores the countless varieties of English and the perils of marketing brands with names like Pschitt and Super Piss. With entertaining sections on the oddities of swearing and spelling, spoonerisms and Scrabble, and a consideration of what we mean by 'good English', Mother Tongue is one of the most stimulating books yet written on this endlessly engrossing subject.",

    "description": "In one of her personal letters, Jane Austen wrote \"Little Matters they are to be sure, but highly important.\" In fact, letter-writing was something of an addiction for young women of Jane Austen's time and in her social position, and Austen's letters have a freedom and familiarity that only intimate writing can convey. Wiser than her critics, who were disappointed that her correspondence dwelt on gossip and the minutiae of everyday living, Austen understood the importance of \"Little Matters,\" of the emotional and material details of individual lives shared with friends and family through the medium of the letter. Ironic, acerbic, always entertaining, Jane Austen's letters are a fascinating record not only of her own day-to-day existence, but of the pleasures and frustrations experienced by women of her social class which are so central to her novels. <br /> Vivien Jones's selection includes nearly two-thirds of Austen's surviving correspondence, and her lively introduction and notes set the novelist's most private writings in their wider cultural context.",

Strapping on his false leg, he makes his way to the landing strip to greet the unexpected arrival: William Hardt, a young American lawyer driven by his misguided ambition to win reparations for the island's inhabitants. </p> <p> Hardt is not the first white outsider to pay a visit; the British came earlier, bringing their language, the small pigs that run wild in the jungle, and Shakespeare . . . and the Americans followed with guns, land mines, and Coca-Cola. But in this place of riotously logical ritual, Hardt's determined quest to do good could make him the most devastating visitor of all. </p> <p> Profoundly moving and achingly funny, <i>One Big Damn Puzzler</i> brilliantly explores the collision of the twenty-first century with unsullied pagan reality\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand establishes John Harding as one of the most imaginative contemporary chroniclers of the human condition. </p>",

After a painstaking wait, Nate is even more surprised when it hatches and out pops a baby triceratops that he names Uncle Beazley! But when Nate decides to keep the dino and raise it on his own, he has no idea what he's getting himself into. As Uncle Beazley grows, Nate and his family realize they are not equipped to take care of a full-sized dinosaur, and so with the help of their scientist friend, Nate and Uncle Beazley set off for the NationalMuseum in Washington, D.C., on the hunt for the perfect home for a modern-day dinosaur---then the real trouble begins!<br /><br /><em>The Enormous Egg </em>was originally published in 1956 and has been a classic in children's literature ever since. This brand new edition features amazing new illustrations from Eisner-award winning graphic novelist Mark Crilley (creator of <em>Akiko</em> and <em>Miki Falls</em>).",

    "description": "The 2005 edition of <strong>The Best American Crime Writing</strong> offers the year's most shocking, compelling, and gripping writing about real-life crime, including Peter Landesman's article about female sex slaves (the most requested and widely read <em>New York Times</em> story of 2004), a piece from <em>The New Yorker</em> by Stephen J. Dubner (the coauthor of <strong>Freakanomics</strong>) about a high-society silver thief, and an extraordinarily memorable \"ode to bar fights\" written by Jonathan Miles for <em>Men's Journal</em> after he punched an editor at a staff party. But this year's edition includes a bonus -- an original essay by James Ellroy detailing his fascination with Joseph Wambaugh and how it fed his obsession with crime -- even to the point of selling his own blood to buy Wambaugh's books. Smart, entertaining, and controversial, <strong>The Best American Crime Writing</strong> is an essential edition to any crime enthusiast's bookshelf.",

    "description": "<div>En el mundo postmoderno, la pregunta de \u201c\u00bfcu\u00e1l es la diferencia?\" es una muy importante y relevante, pues explica la naturaleza de la mente postmoderna. En el postmodernismo, no hay ninguna diferencia entre diferentes puntos de vista, religiones y \u00e9tica, entre otros. Todos son v\u00e1lidos. En el libro Entonces, \u00bfcu\u00e1l es la diferencia?, Fritz Ridenour quiere que los cristianos entiendan los distintos puntos de vistas que ofrecen las diversas religiones del mundo actual, sus diferencias y el significado de aquellas religiones que el mundo cataloga como primarias o filosof\u00edas principales. Como cristianos, debemos entender las afirmaciones exclusivas hechas por Cristo acerca de qui\u00e9n es \u00c9l y lo que vino a hacer en el mundo.<br /><br />Ridenour compara el Cuerpo de Cristo--definido como los verdaderos creyentes--con las dem\u00e1s religiones principales del mundo: el juda\u00edsmo, el islamismo, el hinduismo y el budismo. Adem\u00e1s, compara el cristianismo con las nuevas religiones, el ocultismo y los cultos que han surgido, enfoc\u00e1ndose en los or\u00edgenes de los cultos generales al igual que en los principales como: los Testigos de Jehov\u00e1, el mormonismo y el movimiento de la Nueva Era. Como si esto fuera poco, Ridenour tambi\u00e9n examina varias opiniones mundiales que desaf\u00edan o atacan al cristianismo b\u00edblico, incluyendo al baha\u00ed, la ciencia cristiana, el evolucionismo, la masoner\u00eda, el Hare Krishna, las Iglesias Internacionales de Cristo, el humanismo secular, el postmodernismo, la Iglesia de la Unificaci\u00f3n, el unitarismo y la wicca.</div>",

Otherwise, you're on your own.\" Suspicious of any child-rearing theories beyond \"Your children are either the center of your life or they're not,\" Trillin has clearly reveled in the role of family man. Acknowledging the special perils to the privacy of people living with a writer who occasionally remarks, \"I hope you're not under the impression that what you just said was off the record,\" Trillin deals with the subject of family in a way that is loving, honest, and wildly funny in <i>Family Man.</i>",

    "description": "<b>The rags-to-riches story of Coco Chanel plays out in a wonderful picture-book biography as full of style and spirit as its heroine.</b><br /><br />Gabrielle \"Coco\" Chanel was always different. And she vowed to prove that being different was an advantage! Poor, skinny, and orphaned, Coco stubbornly believed that she was as good as the wealthier girls of Paris. Tapping into her creativity and her sewing skills, she began making clothes that suited her (and her pocketbook) \u2014 and soon a new generation of independent working women craved her sleek, comfortable, and practical designs. Now an icon of fashion and culture, Coco Chanel continues to inspire young readers, showing just how far a person can come with spunk, determination, and flair.",

    "description": "Now available as an audio CD, in Eudora Welty's own voice, or as a book. Eudora Welty was born in 1909 in Jackson, Mississippi. In a continuous thread of revelation she sketches her autobiography and tells us how her family and her surroundings contributed to the shaping not only of her personality but of her writing. Homely and commonplace sights, sounds, and objects resonate with the emotions of recollection: the striking clocks, the Victrola, her orphaned father's coverless little book saved since boyhood, the tall mountains of the West Virginia back country that become a metaphor for her mother's sturdy independence, Eudora's earliest box camera that suspended a moment forever and taught her that every feeling awaits a gesture. She has recreated this vanished world with the same subtlety and insight that mark her fiction. Even if Eudora Welty were not a major writer, her description of growing up in the South--of the interplay between black and white, between town and countryside, between dedicated schoolteachers and the public they taught--would he notable. That she is a splendid writer of fiction gives her own experience a family likeness to others in the generation of young Southerners that produced a literary renaissance. Until publication of this book, she had discouraged biographical investigations. It undoubtedly was not easy for this shy and reticent lady to undertake her own literary biography, to relive her own memories (painful as well as pleasant), to go through letters and photographs of her parents and grandparents. But we are in her debt, for the distillation of experience she offers us is a rare pleasure for her admirers, a treat to everyone who lovesgood writing and anyone who is interested in the seeds of creativity.",

    "description": "The charming true story of a spirited young woman who finds adventure--and the love of her life--in Paris. <br /><br /> \"This isn't like me. I'm not the sort of girl who crosses continents to meet up with a man she hardly knows. Paris hadn't even been part of my travel plan...\" <br /><br /> A delightful, fresh twist on the travel memoir, <i>Almost French</i> takes us on a tour that is fraught with culture clashes but rife with deadpan humor. Sarah Turnbull's stint in Paris was only supposed to last a week. Chance had brought Sarah and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric together in Bucharest, and on impulse she decided to take him up on his offer to visit him in the world's most romantic city. Sacrificing Vegemite for vichyssoise, the feisty Sydney journalist does her best to fit in, although her conversation, her laugh, and even her wardrobe advertise her foreigner status. <br /><br /> But as she navigates the highs and lows of this strange new world, from life in a bustling <i>quatier</i> and surviving Parisian dinner parties to covering the <i>haute couture</i> fashion shows and discovering the hard way the paradoxes of France today, little by little Sarah falls under its spell: maddening, mysterious, and charged with that French specialty-<i>s\u00e9duction</i>.<br /><br /> An entertaining tale of being a fish out of water, <i>Almost French</i> is an enthralling read as Sarah Turnbull leads us on a magical tour of this seductive place-and culture-that has captured her heart.",

From the moment Jeeves glides into Bertie Wooster's life and provides him with a magical hangover cure, Bertie begins to wonder how he's ever managed without him. Jeeves makes himself totally indispensable in every way, disentangling the hapless Bertie from scrapes with formidable aunts, madcap girls and unbidden guests. His ability to dig assorted fellows out of sundry holes is nothing short of miraculous. In short, the man is a paragon.<br /><br />\"Wodehouse is the greatest comic writer ever,\" Douglas Adams.",

    "description": "Americans have become so accustomed to following doctors' orders that many prescriptions, medical tests, and surgical procedures are accepted without question. This blind faith can be dangerous! Modern medicine offers us a wide range of powerful treatments for ailments large and small. But did you know that some common \"cures\" come with serious, life-threatening risks, or may do nothing at all? This book contains much more vital information you need to know to take charge of your health--before you see your doctor. Includes information on: cholesterol-lowering medications; high-strength asthma inhalers; steroids; antibiotics; and Ritalin.Some startling facts you should know:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Some sholesterol-lowering medications can actually increase your chances of dying.<br /><br /><br />The rise in asthma deaths may be linked to high-strength inhalers.<br /><br /><br />In some cases, it's safer to do nothing than have surgery for prostate cancer.<br /><br /><br />Steroids, now widely prescribed for many minor conditions, can cause immediate, permanent, debilitating damage.<br /><br /><br />Bone scans to screen for osteoporosis are imprecise, often inaccurate, and may not signify anything.<br /><br /><br />In the overwhelming majority of cases, antibiotics are prescribed for conditions they cannot treat.<br /><br /><br />Ritalin, taken by as many as a million American children, has questionable benefits, numerous side effects, and a high potential for addiction or abuse.<br /><br /><br />The U.S. Natinoal Institutes of Health estimate that 90% of patients who undergo bypass surgery receive almost no benefits.<br /><br /><br />and much more vital information you need to know--before you see your doctor.",

    "description": "Like HOMECOMING (0-7434-6754-X) did for Star Trek Voyager and AVATAR (0-7434-0050-X) did for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, DEATH IN WINTER picks up the Star Trek: The Next Generation story after the TV/movies are complete and tells all-new stories about favourite Next Generation characters and their subsequent lives. After the fall of Shinzon (as seen in the feature film, STAR TREK: NEMESIS) the elite of the Romulan Empire are battling over who will seize control. Caught up in this struggle are the Kevrata, a once proud people, now strangled under Romulan domination. When a biogenetic disease threatens to wipe out their race, Starfleet assigns its new Chief Medical Officer, Dr Beverly Crusher, to aid the populace. But when she suddenly goes missing and is presumed dead, Jean-Luc Picard must race to try and locate Crusher and help find a cure for the disease that could kill millions.",

From the author of Trainspotting, an adaptation of another of his best-selling works - a collection of short stories - The Acid House Trilogy<br /><br />The Acid House Trilogy is made up of three of Welsh's most powerful stories; The Granton Star Cause (starring Stephen McCole and Maurice Roeves), The Acid House (starring Ewen Bremner, Martin Clunes and Jemma Redgrave) and A Soft Touch (starring Kevin McKidd and Michelle Gomez). All three stories come from the rough, tough badlands of the schemes of North Edinburgh and take us into a dark but hilarious world of drugs, deviant sex and football hooliganism fired by Welsh's passion and fierce steaming rock and roll.",

The humble Wang Lung glories in the soil he works, nurturing the land as it nurtures him and his family. Nearby, the nobles of the House of Hwang consider themselves above the land and its workers; but they will soon meet their own downfall.<br /><br />Hard times come upon Wang Lung and his family when flood and drought force them to seek work in the city. The working people riot, breaking into the homes of the rich and forcing them to flee. When Wang Lung shows mercy to one noble and is rewarded, he begins to rise in the world, even as the House of Hwang falls.",

While it might be okay for Sashy, it's certainly not what she envisioned for herself when she was sixteen. So when her boyfriend proposes to her during the reception, Flora makes a wish to go back and do it all over again. The next morning she wakes up to find that she has been given the ultimate second chance--she's sixteen again. As Flora navigates school, first loves--new and old--and discovers what it really means to make adult choices, will she stay in her new body or try and find her way home?--in Jenny Colgan's <i>The Boy I Loved Before</i>.",

    "description": "In the bestselling tradition of <i>Running with Scissors</i> and <i>Don't Lets Go to the Dogs Tonight</i> a hilarious, affecting memoir of the authors upbringing in an ashram in India In 1980, when she is seven, the authors parents, 60s-holdover hippies, leave California for an ashram in a cobra- ridden, drought-stricken spot in India. Rachel is the only foreign child in a hundred-mile radius. The ashram is devoted to Meher Baba, best known as the guru to Pete Townshend and thus for having inspired some songs by The Who, for having kept a lifelong vow of silence, and for having coined the slogan, Dont worry, be happy. Cavorting through these pages are some wonderfully eccentric charactersincluding a holy madman permanently doubled over from years of stooping to collect invisible objects; a senile librarian who nightly sings scales outside Rachels window, only with grunts instead of notes; and a middle-aged male virgin who begs Rachel to critique his epic spiritual poems. Somehow, Rachel manages to keep her wits and humor about her when everyone else seems to have lost touch with reality. Astutely observed and laugh-out-loud funny, this astonishing debut memoir marks the arrival of a major new literary talent.",

    "description": "In 1903, a student at a military academy sent some of his verses to a well-known Austrian poet, requesting an assessment of their value. The older artist, Rainer Maria Rilke (1875\u20131926), replied to the novice in this series of letters \u2014 an amazing archive of remarkable insights into the ideas behind Rilke's greatest poetry. The ten letters reproduced here were written during an important stage in Rilke's artistic development, and they contain many of the themes that later appeared in his best works. The poet himself afterwards stated that his letters contained part of his creative genius, making this volume essential reading for scholars, poetry lovers, and anyone with an interest in Rilke, German poetry, or the creative impulse.",

    "description": "Perhaps the greatest \u201ccloak and sword\u201d story ever written, <i>The Three Musketeers, </i>first published ion 1844, is a tale for all time. Pitting the heroic young d\u2019Artagnan and his noble compatriots, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis against the master of intrigue, Cardinal Richelieu, and the quintessential wicked woman, Lady de Winter, Alexandre Dumas has created an enchanted France of swordplay, schemes and assignations. The era and the characters are based on historical fact, but the glittering romance and fast-paced action spring from a great writer\u2019s incomparable imagination. From the perilous retrieval of the queens gift to her lover in time to foil Rechelieu\u2019s plot to the melodramatic revelation of Lady de Winter\u2019s true identity, <i>The Three Musketeers </i>is the unchallenged archetype for literary romance and a perennial delight for generations of readers.<i>\n  <br /></i>",

Story-Wallah gathers the finest South Asian voices in fiction for the first time in a single volume. As Shyam Selvadurai writes in his introduction, \"The stories jostle up against each other . . . The effect is a marvelous cacophony that reminds me of . . . one of those South Asian bazaars, a bargaining, carnival-like milieu. The goods on sale in this instance being stories hawked by story-traders: story-wallahs.\" In this book, some of the world's best fiction writers hawk their wares from different parts of the South Asian diaspora -- Sri Lanka, India, the United States, Great Britain, Guyana, Malaysia, Trinidad, Fiji -- creating a virtual map of the world with their tales. These stories explore universal themes of identity, culture, and home, and Story-Wallah includes a rich array of experiences: a honeymoon in Sri Lanka, the trials of a Bangladeshi refugee in England, life on a sugar plantation in Trinidad, the attempts of an Indian family to arrange a marriage for their rebellious daughter.<br /> This anthology is essential reading for anyone with an interest in South Asian writers and the dynamic, important tales they have to tell.",

There, an ancient Andean people hid a golden hoard greater than that of any pharaoh, then they and their treasure vanished into history -- until now. <br /><br />1998, the Andes Mountains of Peru. DIRK PITT dives into an ancient sacrificial pool, saving two American archaeologists from certain drowning. But his death-defying rescue is only the beginning, as it draws the intrepid Pitt into a vortex of darkness and danger, corruption and betrayal. A sinister crime syndicate has traced the long-lost treasure -- worth almost a billion dollars -- from the Andes to the banks of a hidden underground river flowing beneath a Mexican desert. Driven by burning greed and a ruthless bloodlust, the syndicate is racing to seize the golden prize...and to terminate the one man who can stop them: DIRK PITT!",

    "description": "<strong>From <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Bernard Cornwell, now available in paperback\u2014the first book in the Grail Series--a spellbinding tale of a young man, a fearless archer, who sets out wanting to avenge his family's honor and winds up on a quest for the Holy Grail. </strong><br /><br />At dawn on Easter morning 1343, a marauding band of French raiders arrives by boat to ambush the coastal English village of Hookton. To brave young Thomas, the only survivor, the horror of the attack is epitomized in the casual savagery of a particular black-clad knight, whose flag -- three yellow hawks on a blue field -- presides over the bloody affair. As the killers sail away, Thomas vows to avenge the murder of his townspeople and to recapture a holy treasure that the black knight stole from the church.<br /><br />To do this, Thomas of Hookton must first make his way to France; So in 1343 he joins the army of King Edward III as it is about to invade the continent -- the beginning of the Hundred Years War. A preternaturally gifted bowman, Thomas quickly becomes recognized as one of England's most deadly archers in King Edward's march across France. Yet he never stops scanning the horizon for his true enemy's flag.<br /><br />When Thomas saves a young Frenchwoman from a bloodthirsty crowd, her father -- French nobleman Sir Guillaume d'Evecque -- rewards his bravery by joining him in the hunt for the mysterious dark knight and the stolen holy relic. What begins as a search for vengeance will soon prove the beginning of an even higher purpose: the quest for the Holy Grail itself.",

    "description": "Skipper, an ex-World War II naval Lieutenant and the narrator of <em>Second Skin</em>, interweaves past and present\u2014what he refers to as his \"naked history\"\u2014in a series of episodes that tell the story of a volatile life marked by pitiful losses, as well as a more elusive, overwhelming, joy. The past: the suicides of his father, wife and daughter, the murder of his son-in-law, a brutal rape, and subsequent mutiny at sea. The present: caring for his granddaughter on a \"northern\" island where he works as an artificial inseminator of cows, and attempts to reclaim the innocence with which he faced the tragedies of his earlier life. Combining unflinching descriptions of suffering with his sense of beauty, Hawkes is a master of nimble and sensuous prose who makes the awful and mundane fantastic, and occasionally makes the fantastic surreal.",

          "description": "The character Quatermain (not \"Quartermain\", a common error) is an English-born professional big game hunter and occasional trader in southern Africa. He supports colonial efforts to spread civilization in the Dark Continent, and he also favours native Africans' having a say in their affairs. Quatermain is an imperial outdoorsman who finds English cities and climate unbearable. He prefers to spend most of his life in Africa, where he grew up under the care of his widower father, a Christian missionary. In the earliest-written novels, native Africans refer to Quatermain as Macumazahn, meaning \"Watcher-by-Night,\" a reference to his nocturnal habits and keen instincts. In later-written novels, Macumazahn is said to be a short form of Macumazana, meaning \"One who stands out.\" Quatermain is frequently accompanied by his native servant Hans, a wise and caring family retainer from his youth. His sarcastic comments offer a sharp critique of European conventions.

The mine turns out to be King Solomon's Lost Mine, but with it is a tale of heartbreak---it was children who worked and died in the mine for 400 years, leading to many local myths of curses. It is also practically on the border with a very unfriendly Sudan. Throw in two warring Israeli factions, a hidden monastery guarding an ancient secret, an evil Italian businessman with his own army, and an incredible amount of derring-do and you have one terrific action novel. In the <b>Medusa Stone</b> by Jack DuBrul readers will find an intricate tale filled with action and intrigue. DuBrul is only thirty years old but he is already being compared to the very best in the spy and thriller genre.",

    "description": "A wonderfully warm and heartfelt debut from a stunning new talent. Everyone needs a guardian angel! Some people wait their whole lives to find their soul mates. But not Holly and Gerry. Childhood sweethearts, they could finish each other's sentences and even when they fought, they laughed. No one could imagine Holly and Gerry without each other. Until the unthinkable happens. Gerry's death devastates Holly. But as her 30th birthday looms, Gerry comes back to her. He's left her a bundle of notes, one for each of the months after his death, gently guiding Holly into her new life without him, each note signed 'PS, I Love You'. As the notes are gradually opened, and as the year unfolds, Holly is both cheered up and challenged. The man who knows her better than anyone sets out to teach her that life goes on. With some help from her friends, and her noisy and loving family, Holly finds herself laughing, crying, singing, dancing--and being braver than ever before. Life is for living, she realises--but it always helps if there's an angel watching over you.",

    "description": "The inventive, exuberant, and totally original literary fun that began with The Eyre Affair continues with the second installment in what is sure to become a classic series of literary fantasy.<br /><br />Jasper Fforde and his ever-resourceful literary detective heroine Thursday Next are back in the second installment of what promises to be one of the most talked-about series of the decade <br /><br />If Thursday thought she could avoid the spotlight after her heroic escapades in the pages of Jane Eyre, she was sorely mistaken. The unforgettable literary detective whom Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times calls \"part Bridget Jones, part Nancy Drew and part Dirty Harry\" had another think coming. The love of her life has been eradicated by Goliath, everyone's favorite corrupt multinational. To rescue him Thursday must retrieve a supposedly vanquished enemy from the pages of \"The Raven.\" But Poe is off-limits to even the most seasoned literary interloper. Enter a professional: the man-hating Miss Havisham from Dickens's Great Expectations. As her new apprentice, Thursday keeps her motives secret as she learns the ropes of Jurisfiction, where she moonlights as a Prose Resource Operative inside books. As if jumping into the likes of Kafka, Austen, and Beatrix Potter's Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies weren't enough, Thursday finds herself the target of a series of potentially lethal coincidences, the authenticator of a newly discovered play by the Bard himself, and the only one who can prevent an unidentifiable pink sludge from engulfing all life on Earth.<br /><br />The inventive, exuberant, and totally original literary fun that began with The Eyre Affair continues with Fforde's magnificent new adventure, the second installment in what is sure to become a classic series of literary fantasy.",

It was a brazen crime committed while the whole world was watching the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. Baffled and humiliated, the Norwegian police turned to the one man they believed could help: a half English, half American undercover cop named Charley Hill, the world's greatest art detective.<br /><br /><em>The Rescue Artist</em> is a rollicking narrative that carries readers deep inside the art underworld -- and introduces them to a large and colorful cast of titled aristocrats, intrepid investigators, and thick-necked thugs. But most compelling of all is Charley Hill himself, a complicated mix of brilliance, foolhardiness, and charm whose hunt for a purloined treasure would either cap an illustrious career or be the fiasco that would haunt him forever.",

    "description": "Fontane's enchanting seventeen-year-old heroine, Effi, is married off to Geert von Innstetten, an austere, workaholic civil servant twice her age. Set in Bismarck's Germany, this luminous and moving tale of a socially suitable but emotionally disastrous match, shifts from childhood idyll in Brandenburg, to a remote Baltic port and back to Imperial Berlin.<br /><br />With Effi Briest, Fontane brilliantly demonstrates the truth of his comment that 'women's stories are generally far more interesting'. His taut, ironic narrative depicts a world where sexuality and the will to enjoy life are stifled by narrow-mindedness and circumstance. And in his humane, unsentimental portrait of Effi, who refuses to bow to convention, he offers us a reading experience that is at once touching and unsettling.",

    "description": "Orgasm is one of society\u2019s most compelling, shaping forces -- and most of us probably think that we are living in its golden age. But are we? The history of the orgasm is as elusive as orgasm itself can be, for sex rarely makes the historical record. Now acclaimed British journalist Jonathan Margolis delivers the definitive history of the human orgasm, of sex for pleasure as well as conception -- from prehistory to Viagra. Most people manage just twelve minutes of orgasmic bliss per year. Some never experience it at all. Yet the urge for orgasm rules much of human life, across national and cultural boundaries. How much have we learned about female pleasure since the 1558 discovery of the clitoris? How has the drive for pleasure, and the fear of it, shaped various societies -- from Saint Francis of Assisi and the thorn bush, to \u201cprimitive\u201d tribes who embraced maximum pleasure for both sexes? How much does the sensation of orgasm differ for different people? Drawing on the biology, literature, anthropology, psychology, and technology, Jonathan Margolis delivers the final word on both male and female orgasm in an enlightening history that is a pleasure to read.",

    "description": "The world's threats are universal like the sun but Ricardo Reis takes shelter under his own shadow.<br /><br />Back in Lisbon after sixteen years practicing medicine in Brazil, Ricardo Reis wanders the rain-sodden streets. He longs for the unattainably aristocratic Marcenda, but it is Lydia, the hotel chamber maid who makes and shares his bed. His old friend, the poet Fernando Pessoa, returns to see him, still wearing the suit he was buried in six weeks earlier. It is 1936, the clouds of Fascism are gathering ominously above them, so they talk; a wonderful, rambling discourse on art, truth, poetry, philosophy, destiny and love.",

And the stories of those soldiers are the stories of Glen Cook's hugely popular fantasy series, Chronicles of The Black Company. \n    \n    It is mainly divided into three story arcs based mostly on their location in the continent - Northern Continent, travel South towards their once home and in the Plain of the Glittering Stone. These series are - \n    \n    1. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/233453-the-books-of-the-north\">The Books of the North</a>, sometimes also referred to as The Chronicles of the Black Company (Polish - Ksi\u0119gi P\u00f3\u0142nocy, French - Les livres du Nord, Spanish - Libros del Norte)\n    2. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/233454-the-books-of-the-south\">The Books of the South</a> (Polish - Ksi\u0119gi Po\u0142udnia, Spanish - Libros del Sur, French - Les livres du Sud, Czech - Knihy Jihu)\n    3. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/233455-the-books-of-the-glittering-stone\">The Books of the Glittering Stone</a> (Polish - Ksi\u0119ga L\u015bni\u0105cego Kamienia, Spanish - Los libros de la Piedra Brillante, French - Les livres de la Pierre scintillante)\n    \n    There is a sense of ending and closure after The Books of the North but readers interested in Black Company's further adventures can proceed to read the other two story arcs for final closure. \n    \n    <b>Short Stories</b>\n    \"Raker\"\u2014appeared in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (August 1982).

    "description": "In <i>My Mother's House</i> and <i>Sido</i>, Colette plays fictional variations on the themes of childhood, family, and, above all, her mother. Vividly alive, fond of cities, music, theater, and books, Sido devoted herself to her village, Saint-Saveur; to her garden, with its inhabitants and its animals; and, especially, to her children, particularly her youngest, whom she called Minet-Ch\u00e9ri. Unlike <i>Gigi</i> and <i>Ch\u00e9ri</i>, which focus largely on sexual love and its repercussions, <i>My Mother's House</i> and <i>Sido </i>center on the compelling figure of a powerful, nurturing woman in late-nineteenth-century rural France, conveying the impact she had on her community and on her daughter -- who grew up to be a great writer.",

    "description": "Written in 1923, <i>Green Wheat </i>is set in a villa in Brittany and is a story of burgeoning sexuality. This edition does more than meet Rogow\u2019s mark \"to do justice to Colette\u2019s enormous talent,\" it presents a great classic to the world once again.<br /><br />From the Translator\u2019s Preface:<br />Of her more than twenty books, <i>Green Wheat </i>is perhaps Colette\u2019s most polished, most perfect. It was in Green Wheat that she achieved an exquisite blend of two of her greatest gifts as a fiction writer\u2014her uncanny ability to fathom the hearts of adolescents, and her skill at describing nature with the phrasing of a poet and the colors and light of a great landscape painter. This combination helps make <i>Green Wheat </i>one of the enduring works of fiction of the last 100 years. . . . Ultimately, the book is a story about the loss of Eden, both of youth and of nature. . . . It is about the loss of a type of hope, a hope that many of us cling to, that love can somehow escape the imperfections of life.<br /><br />Zack Rogow translates French literature and was a co-winner of the PEN/Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Award for <i>Earthlight</i>, by Andr\u00e9 Breton, as well as winner of a Bay Area Book Reviewers Award (BABRA) for his translation of George Sand\u2019s novel, <i>Horace</i>. He is the editor of a new anthology of U.S. poetry, <i>The Face of Poetry</i>, to be published by University of California Press in 2004. He teaches in the M.F.A. in Writing Program at the California College of Arts &amp; Crafts and lives in San Francisco.<br /><br />Colette, whose real name was Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, was born in the village of Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye in Burgundy, France in 1873 and died in Paris in 1954. Her many books include <i>Gigi </i>(1944), <i>The Vagabond </i>(1912), <i>Cheri </i>(1929), and <i>The Last of Cheri </i>(1932). She is considered one of the great novelists of the 20th century. Among her many awards, Colette was made a member of the Belgian Royal Academy in the 1930s and was also the first woman to be admitted to the prestigious Goncourt Academy. In 1953 she became a grand officer of the Legion of Honour. She is a legendary figure who lived a colorful and bohemian life and her writings are rich with the joys and pain",

    "description": "In this second of a planned five-volume series, David Roy provides a complete and annotated translation of the famous <i>Chin P'ing Mei</i>, an anonymous sixteenth-century Chinese novel that focuses on the domestic life of His-men Ch'ing, a corrupt, upwardly mobile merchant in a provincial town, who maintains a harem of six wives and concubines. This work, known primarily for its erotic realism, is also a landmark in the development of narrative art--not only from a specifically Chinese perspective but in a world-historical context.<br /><br />With the possible exception of <i>The Tale of Genji</i> (1010) and <i>Don Quixote</i> (1615), there is no earlier work of prose fiction of equal sophistication in world literature. Although its importance in the history of Chinese narrative has long been recognized, the technical virtuosity of the author, which is more reminiscent of the Dickens of <i>Bleak House</i>, the Joyce of <i>Ulysses</i>, or the Nabokov of <i>Lolita</i> than anything in the earlier Chinese fiction tradition, has not yet received adequate recognition. This is partly because all of the existing European translations are either abridged or based on an inferior recension of the text. This translation and its annotation aim to faithfully represent and elucidate all the rhetorical features of the original in its most authentic form and thereby enable the Western reader to appreciate this Chinese masterpiece at its true worth.",

The more complete version available today comprises one hundred chapters, amounting to over a thousand pages.\n    Its graphically explicit depiction of sexuality has garnered the novel a level of notoriety in China akin to Fanny Hill and Lady Chatterley's Lover in English literature, but critics such as the translator David Roy see a firm moral structure which exacts retribution for the sexual libertinism of the central characters.\n    \n    <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Ping_Mei\">For more information, visit Wikipedia.</a>",

    "description": "The Story of an African Farm By Olive Schreiner A classic story of rural life in 19th Century South Africa, it is a searing indictment of the rigid Boer social conventions. The first of the great South African novels chronicles the adventures of three childhood friends who defy societal repression. The novel's unorthodox views on religion and marriage aroused widespread controversy upon its 1883 publication, and the work retains in power more than a century later. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works. To ensure a high quality product, each title has been meticulously hand curated by our staff. Our philosophy has been guided by a desire to provide the reader with a book that is as close as possible to ownership of the original work. We hope that you will enjoy this wonderful classic work, and that for you it becomes an enriching experience.",

    "description": "<i>I don't know how old I was when I watched my mother's murder, nor do I know how old I am today.'</i><br /><br />The illegitimate daughter of a peasant and an American GI, Elizabeth Kim spent her early years as a social outcast in her village in the Korean countryside. Ostracized by their family and neighbours, she and her mother were regularly pelted with stones on their way home from the rice fields. Yet there was a tranquil happiness in the intense bond between mother and daughter. Until the day that Elizabeth's grandfather and uncle came to punish her mother from the dishonour she had brought on the family, and executed her in front of her daughter.<br /><br />Elizabeth was dumped in an orphanage in Seoul. After some time, she was lucky enough to be adopted by an American couple. But when she arrived in America she found herself once again surrounded by fanaticism and prejudice.<br /><br />Elizabeth's mother had always told her that life was made up of ten thousand joys as well as ten thousand sorrows, and, supported by her loving daughter, and by a return to her Buddhist faith, she finally found a way to savour those joys, as well as the courage to exorcise the demons of her past.",

          "description": "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust is a tragic play in two parts: [book:Faust : Der Trag\u00f6die Erster Teil|1095059] (translated as: [book:Faust Part One|14706]) and [book:Faust : Der Trag\u00f6die Zweiter Teil|1095060] ([book:Faust: Part Two|14707]). Although rarely staged in its entirety, it is the play with the largest audience numbers on German-language stages. Faust is Goethe's most famous work and considered by many to be one of the greatest works of German literature.\n    \n    Goethe completed a preliminary version of [book:Faust Part One|14706] in 1806. The 1808 publication was followed by the revised 1828\u201329 edition, which was the last to be edited by Goethe himself. Prior to these appeared a partial printing in 1790 of [book:Goethe's Faust: Ein Fragment|17107703] (Faust: a Fragment).\n    \n    The earliest forms of the work, known as the [book:Urfaust|1384628], were developed between 1772 and 1775; however, the details of that development are no longer entirely clear. Urfaust has twenty-two scenes, one in prose, two largely prose and the remaining 1,441 lines in rhymed verse. The manuscript is lost, but a copy was discovered in 1886.\n    \n    Goethe finished writing [book:Faust: Part Two|14707] in 1831. In contrast to Part One, the focus here is no longer on the soul of Faust, which has been sold to the devil, but rather on social phenomena such as psychology, history and politics, in addition to mystical and philosophical topics. The second part formed the principal occupation of Goethe's last years. It appeared only posthumously in 1832.\n    \n    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goethe%27s_Faust",

    "description": "\"A charmingly upbeat tale... Peck's stylish story offers not only pleasant diversion but a vicarious boost, and an urge to cheer, 'Go, girls!'\"--<i>Arizona Daily Star</i><br /><br />Lesley Hockaday is a St. Louis society woman, Margo Mayhew a Chicago schoolteacher and the mother of a teenage daughter, and Julia Steadman a single, successful Manhattan interior designer. Best friends during their Missouri childhood, the passage of time, the thousands of miles between them, and the demands of family and careers have taken a toll on their friendship. When a shocking act of violence reminds them how precious life really is, the three friends decide it's time for a reunion and embark on a long-awaited trip to London.<br /><br />From the cozy confines of Mrs. Smith-Porter's bed-and-breakfast, Lesley, Margo, and Julia enter a gracious world of high tea in the garden, antique markets, picture-perfect countryside, and unexpected romance. The London holiday presents them with more than a few surprises, becomes a journey of self-discovery and a chance to renew the bonds of friendship, and holds the promise of three new lives awaiting them.",

Harlan Ellison's stories and essays have been on the cutting edge of contemporary American Literature for over 40 years, but he stubbornly refuses to abandon the use of a manual typewriter. He's involved in every medium from television drama to comic books, and his works have been translated into 26 languages. Although he's won more awards for his writing than any living fantasist, Harlan still refuses to eat lima beans. In May 1996, White Wolf announced what is still its most ambitious publishing program for a single author: the first 20 volumes of the collected fiction, essays, teleplays and columns of the writer whom The Washington Post calls \"\"one of the great living American short story writers\".\" The first volume of this series, containing An Edge in My Voice and Over the Edge, is now available in trade paperback. Both books have been completely revised, updated and expanded for the hardcover publication, and this trade edition has been re-edited as well\".",

    "description": "<b>The global phenomenon, embraced by business worldwide and now published in more than 40 languages.</b><br /><br />This international bestseller challenges everything you thought you knew about the requirements for strategic success.<br /><br />Since the dawn of the industrial age, companies have engaged in head-to-head competition in search of sustained, profitable growth. They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.<br /><br />In the international bestseller <i>Blue Ocean Strategy</i>, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"\u2014untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call \u201cvalue innovation,\u201d create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.<br /><br /><i>Blue Ocean Strategy</i> presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future.",

No longer the man who loved obscure Japanese cinema and wry humor, Crimmins' husband has emerged from the accident a childlike and unpredictable replica of his former self with a short attention span and a penchant for inane cartoons. <i>Where Is the Mango Princess?</i> is a breathtaking account that explores the very nature of personality-and the complexities of the heart.",

    "description": "In Enchantment, Card works his magic as never before, transforming the timeless story of Sleeping Beauty into an original fantasy brimming with romance and adventure.<br /><br />The moment Ivan stumbled upon a clearing in the dense Carpathian forest, his life was forever changed. Atop a pedestal encircled by fallen leaves, the beautiful princess Katerina lay still as death. But beneath the foliage a malevolent presence stirred and sent the ten-year-old Ivan scrambling for the safety of Cousin Marek's farm.<br /><br />Now, years later, Ivan is an American graduate student, engaged to be married. Yet he cannot forget that long-ago day in the forest--or convince himself it was merely a frightened boy's fantasy. Compelled to return to his native land, Ivan finds the clearing just as he left it.<br /><br />This time he does not run. This time he awakens the beauty with a kiss . . . and steps into a world that vanished a thousand years ago.<br /><br />A rich tapestry of clashing worlds and cultures, Enchantment is a powerfully original novel of a love and destiny that transcend centuries . . . and the dark force that stalks them across the ages.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

Each beautifully packaged volume offers a way to see the world anew, to rediscover great civilizations and legends, vast deserts andunspoiled mountain ranges, unusual flora and strange new creatures, and much more.",

    "description": "The Reenchantment of the World is a perceptive study of our scientific consciousness and a cogent and forceful challenge to its supremacy. Focusing on the rise of the mechanistic idea that we can know the natural world only by distancing ourselves from it, Berman shows how science acquired its controlling position in the consciousness of the West. He analyzes the holistic, animistic tradition--destroyed in the wake of Scientific Revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries--which viewed man as a participant in the cosmos, not as an isolated observer. Arguing that the holistic world view must be revived in some credible form before we destroy our society and our environment, he explores the possibilities for a consciousness appropriate to the modern era. Ecological rather than animistic, this new world view would be grounded in the real and intimate connection between man and nature.",

    "description": "One of the world's most celebrated authors, Margaret Atwood has penned a collection of smart and entertaining fictional essays, in the genre of her popular books <i>Good Bones</i> and <i>Murder in the Dark</i>, punctuated with wonderful illustrations by the author. Chilling and witty, prescient and personal, delectable and tart, these highly imaginative, vintage Atwoodian mini-fictions speak on a broad range of subjects, reflecting the times we live in with deadly accuracy and knife-edge precision.<br /><br />In pieces ranging in length from a mere paragraph to several pages, Atwood gives a sly pep talk to the ambitious young; writes about the disconcerting experience of looking at old photos of ourselves; gives us Horatio's real views on Hamlet; and examines the boons and banes of orphanhood. <i>Bring Back Mom: An Invocation</i>; explores what life was really like for the \"perfect\" homemakers of days gone by, and in <i>The Animals Reject Their Names</i> she runs history backward, with surprising results.<br /><br />Chilling and witty, prescient and personal, delectable and tart, <i>The Tent</i> is vintage Atwood, enhanced by the author's delightful drawings.",

    "description": "R.J. Decker, star tenant of the local trailer park and neophyte private eye is fishing for a killer. Thanks to a sportsman's scam that's anything but sportsmanlike, there's a body floating in Coon Bog, Florida -- and a lot that's rotten in the murky waters of big-stakes, large-mouth bass tournaments. Here Decker will team up with a half-blind, half-mad hermit with an appetite for road kill; dare to kiss his ex-wife while she's in bed with her new husband; and face deadly TV evangelists, dangerously seductive women, and a pistol-toting redneck with a pit bull on his arm. And here his own life becomes part of the stakes. For while the \"double whammy\" is the lure, first prize is for the most ingenious murder.",

Lydia's struggle to keep the promise may cost her the loss of \"the sweetest, kindest, and most handsome Plain boy in all of Lancaster County\"\ufffdLevi King.<br /><br />A thoroughly modern young woman, Sarah Cain had ridiculed her sister's choice of a Plain life-style, which served only to intensify the lifelong rift between them. Now, twelve years later, Sarah is stunned by news of her sister's death and baffled by Ivy's choice of a guardian. How can Sarah sacrifice her successful career and a life she enjoys to raise five Amish orphans? And what of Bryan Ford, the man in her life?<br /><br />Upon her arrival in Lancaster County, Sarah holds a grief all her own\ufffdone very different from the suffering of her nieces and nephews. Can the sorrow that divides them ultimately unite the new family? Will Sarah discover that Lancaster County's Amish community is not only a simpler place, but also a healing place?",

    "description": "For more than two years, one book has taken over Germany's hardcover and paperback bestseller lists, reaching number one in Der Spiegel and setting off a frenzy in bookstores: <i>The Swarm</i>.<br /><br />Whales begin sinking ships. Toxic, eyeless crabs poison Long Island's water supply. The North Sea shelf collapses, killing thousands in Europe. Around the world, countries are beginning to feel the effects of the ocean's revenge as the seas and their inhabi-tants begin a violent revolution against mankind. In this riveting novel, full of twists, turns, and cliffhangers, a team of scientists discovers a strange, intelligent life force called the Yrr that takes form in marine animals, using them to wreak havoc on humanity for our ecological abuses. Soon a struggle between good and evil is in full swing, with both human and suboceanic forces battling for control of the waters. At stake is the survival of the Earth's fragile ecology -- and ultimately, the survival of the human race itself.<br /><br />The apocalyptic catastrophes of <em>The Day After Tomorrow</em> meet the watery menace of <em>The Abyss</em> in this gripping, scientifically realistic, and utterly imaginative thriller. With 1.5 million copies sold in Germany -- where it has been on the bestseller list without fail since its debut -- and the author's skillfully executed blend of compelling story, vivid characters, and eerie locales, Frank Schatzing's The Swarm will keep you in tense anticipation until the last suspenseful page is turned.<br />(front flap)",

    "description": "What is taste? Is it individual or imposed on us from the outside? Why are so many of us so intimidated when presented with the wine list at a restaurant? In <i>The Accidental Connoisseur</i>, journalist Lawrence Osborne takes off on a personal voyage through a little-known world in pursuit of some answers. Weaving together a fantastic cast of eccentrics and obsessives, industry magnates and small farmers, the author explores the way technological change, opinionated critics, consumer trends, wheelers and dealers, trade wars, and mass market tastes have made the elixir we drink today entirely different from the wine drunk by our grandparents.<br /><br />In his search for wine that is a true expression of the place that produced it, Osborne takes the reader from the high-tech present to the primitive past. From a lavish lunch with wine tsar Robert Mondavi to the cellars of Marquis Piero Antinori in Florence, from the tasting rooms of Chateau Lafite to the humble vineyards of northern Lazio, Osborne winds his way through Renaissance palaces, $27 million wineries, tin shacks and garages, opulent restaurants, world-famous chais and vineyards, renowned villages and obscure landscapes, as well as the great cities which are the temples of wine consumption: New York, San Francisco, Paris, Florence, and Rome. On the way, we will be shown the vast tapestry of this much-desired, little-understood drink: who produces it and why, who consumes it, who critiques it? Enchanting, delightful, entertaining, and, above all, down to earth, this is a wine book like no other.",

Anita lives in a parallel universe, much like our own, save that not only do things like vampires and shapeshifters exist, but their presence is public knowledge. The novels follow Anita's conflicts with the supernatural as she attempts to solve a variety of mysteries, come to terms with her abilities, and navigate a complex series of romantic and political relationships. <i>(edited from Wikipedia)</i>\n    \n    Please note: Each book in this series is a whole story with a beginning and an ending, however the plot of each book relies heavily on the prior books in the series. It is recommended that you read the full length novels - including the novellas like \"Micah\" and \"Flirt\" - in the order they were published. At this time, the author has no plans on ending the series.\n    \n    See also <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/69802-anita-blake-vampire-hunter-graphic-novels\">the graphic novel adaptations</a>.\n    \n    Reading Order per author's <a href=\"http://www.laurellkhamilton.org/works/\">website</a> & Facebook posting <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/laurell-k-hamilton/current-list-of-anita-blake-works/10152399083544352\">Current List of Anita Blake Works</a>.",

    "description": "It is New Year\u2019s Eve when the storm of the century hits northern California. In a quiet neighborhood in San Francisco, amid the chaos of fallen trees and damaged homes, the lives of three strangers are about to collide. For Quinn Thompson, what happens in the storm\u2019s wake will bring down a barrier he has built around himself since his wife\u2019s death. For neighbor Maggie Dartman, it will spark friendship at a time when she needs it most. And for Jack Adams, a carpenter who will repair Quinn\u2019s and Maggie\u2019s homes, the storm brings an opportunity: to help two people and to be repaid with the greatest gift of all.<br /><br />As three lives come together and a unique friendship is forged, something extraordinary begins to happen...Maggie, still grieving a loss, slowly comes alive again-\u2013and Jack finally shares a painful secret he has hidden for years. But at the center of the friendship is Quinn. A man who has scaled heights of success in business, Quinn is now adrift, waiting as builders put the finishing touches on his newest passion, a 180-foot yacht he plans to sail around the world. Looking back at all he missed with his family while he built his empire, Quinn is consumed by guilt, focused only on escaping to the sea. But as his plans near completion, and his friendship with Maggie begins to change, Quinn faces a choice\u2013between a safe haven and an adventure of the heart. The choice he makes will affect other lives as powerfully as his own. And it will take him on an extraordinary journey-\u2013and into a second, terrifying storm, one that will bring him danger...or deliverance.<br /><br />Danielle Steel brings us miracles big and small-\u2013the kind we are blessed with and those we give to others. With a subtle hand and a flawless touch, she has written a novel that soars with hope, and makes us laugh, cry, and care.<br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

These sayings were selected and compiled into one book as being worthy of special note on account of their beauty and relevance for moulding the lives of future generations of Buddhists. They are divided into 26 chapters and the stanzas are arranged according to subject matter.",

    "description": "Eastern Kentucky, 1956. Life is hard and sweet for ten-year-old Icy Sparks. Orphaned as a baby but raised by adoring grandparents, she is a bright, curious child. Yet something strange is happening to her, something that she'd like to keep hidden. Try as she might, her secrets--those croaks, jerks, and spasms--keep slipping out. Her teachers think she's willful, her friends call her the \"Frog Child.\" Exiled from the schoolroom, she spends time in a children's asylum where she learns about being different and teaches her doctors even more. Yet, it is not until Icy returns home that she really begins to flower through her friendship with the eccentric and obese Miss Emily. Under her tutelage, Icy takes her initial steps back into the world, including her first hilarious and heartbreaking misadventure with romance. Icy Sparks, the account of this wonderfully original and charming character's adventures and mishaps, introduces a fresh, quirky new voice in the tradition of such Southern writers as Harper Lee, Olive Ann Burns, and Eudora Welty.",

And then one day, as if in answer to her prayers, the splendid figure of Guy de Gervais, a true knight in shining armor, rides into her cloistered world and spirits her away.<br /><br />For Magdalen it is love at first sight. The one and only love of her life. Yet Guy sees only his responsibility to keep Magdalen safe until she can be wed to his nephew and thus fulfill her political destiny.<br /><br />Then duty calls Guy to the bloody battlefields of France, and when he returns, time has transformed Magdalen into a stunningly sensual beauty. Suddenly the noble knight is fighting the fiercest battle of his life: against a searing desire for a woman he cannot have.",

On the eve of making the most momentous decision of his life, while he is contemplating a loveless marriage with a woman his friends have compared to a cold poultice, he is on his way home, a little worse for drink, and finds a perfect opportunity for escape by her boring destiny. <br /><br />He discovers a beautiful young fugitive climbing out of a window by means of knotted sheets, dressed in boy's clothing lovely Penelope Creed is fleeing from London. She is a brilliant London heires with and lavish life, and a proposed marriage to her repulsive fish-lipped cousin, a man she loathed. She has a shimmering dream of a love she had known once--and lost. Discovered by Sir Wyndham, he can't allow her to travel to the countryside all alone, so he offers himself as her protector.<br /><br />And with her in flight across a landscape of excitement was a man like no other she had known-- handsome, sophisticated, but cynical. They had met by accident, been drawn together by danger. And now only his masked emotions and the shifting impulses of her own wild young heart would tell what their destiny would be.... When their stagecoach overturns, they find themselves embroiled with thieves, at the center of a murder investigation, and finally, in love.",

    "description": "A young and lovely runaway alone on the road to London Miss Charity Steane is running away from the drudgery of her aunt's household to find her grandfather. Not expecting her visit, the old gentleman is not in London but is away in the country. The first time the young Viscount Desford saw the girl, he thought she was a child. A child in trouble, running away. But she was a girl nearly seventeen and when Viscount encounters her walking to London alone, he feels honor bound to assist her. But after Desford rescued her, everyone assumed that he had run off with her. A scandal broth in the making, and dashing about the countryside together, the Viscount must prevent his exasperating charge from bringing him ruin upon herself... and him. Now in disgrace, Desford had to find the truth behind Cherry's strange behavior--before his own life came apart....<br /><br />Who else should he turn to in such a scrape but his childhood playmate, Henrietta Silverdale? And although they refused to oblige their parents by marrying, they have always been the best of friends. But as Desford pursues Cherry's grandfather and father around the seedier fringes of society, Hetta is forced to wonder if he might not, at last, have fallen in love. Without the timely intervention of his brother and Hetta's suitor Gary Nethercott, Desford is in danger of making a jumble of his affairs.",

    "description": "In the summer of 1815, beneath the aegis of the Army of Occupation, Brussels is the gayest town in Europe. And the red-haired widow Lady Barbara Childe, renowned for being as outrageous as she is beautiful, is at the centre of the social whirl and of all that is fashionable and light-hearted. However, the city was a nest of intrigue --Napoleon threatened Europe--but the talk was only of this dazzling and tempestuous young. Every brilliant ball, supper, and concert in the feverish spring seemed to bring her a new conquest by storm. She is the talk of the ton. She flirts shamelessly, dresses outrageously, and scandalizes polite society. That doesn't stop one of her adorers--the dashing Colonel Charles Audley, an aide-de-camp to the Duke of Wellington-- from falling madly in love with the beautiful young widow--and proposing marriage. Threatened by the growing tide of scandal, she allowed Colonel Charles Audley to claim her for his bride.<br /><br />The eve of the fateful Battle of Waterloo, their betrothal falls apart. It isn't until Charles marches off to fight Napoleon that Barbara discovers where her heart lies. Now, she can do nothing but wait as the battle rages, praying for the safety of the one man who can set her free from her wild impulses. But as the clouds of war gathered, he turned from her in a sudden, mysterious indifference. Stunned, bewildered, Barbara wondered what secret she must fathom, what new seduction must she devise, to regain the one man who--she ruefully realized--had truly claimed her heart?",

    "description": "<i>The best way to teach is to learn together with the students. One of the rare breed of teachers who do know this is Nancie Atwell.</i><br /> - The New York Times<i>Reading this book can be revolutionary. . . . Atwell leads us to new understandings of teaching and learning in a workshop classroom.</i><br /> - Voices from the Middle When first published in 1987, this seminal work was widely hailed for its honest examination of how teachers teach, how students learn, and the gap that lies in between. In depicting her own classroom struggles, Nancie Atwell shook our orthodox assumptions about skill-and-drill-based curriculums and became a pioneer of responsive teaching. Now, in the long awaited second edition, Atwell reflects on the next ten years of her experience, rethinks and clarifies old methods, and demonstrates new, more effective approaches.<p>The second edition still urges educators to \"come out from behind their own big desks\" to turn classrooms into workshops where students and teachers create curriculums together. But it also advocates a more activist role for teachers. Atwell writes, \"I'm no longer willing to withhold suggestions and directions from my kids when I can help them solve a problem, do something they've never done before, produce stunning writing, and ultimately become more independent of me.\"</p><p>More than 70 percent of the material is new, with six brand-new chapters on genres, evaluation, and the teacher as writer. There are also lists of several hundred minilessons, and scripts and examples for teaching them; new expectations and rules for writing and reading workshops; ideas for teaching conventions; new systems for record keeping; lists of essential books for students and teachers; and forms for keeping track of individual spelling, skills, proofreading, homework, writing, and reading.</p><p>The second edition of <i>In the Middle</i> is written in the same engaging style as its predecessor. It reads like a story - one that readers will be pleased to learn has no end. As Atwell muses, \"I know my students and I will continue to learn and be changed. I am resigned - happily - to be always beginning for the rest of my life as a teacher.\"</p>",

    "description": "Originally published to wide critical acclaim in France, where it elicited comparisons to Art Spiegelman's <b>Maus</b>, <b>Persepolis</b> is Marjane Satrapi's wise, funny, and heartbreaking memoir of growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. In powerful black-and-white comic strip images, Satrapi tells the story of her life in Tehran from ages six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah's regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution, and the devastating effects of war with Iraq. The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the great-granddaughter of one of Iran's last emperors, Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country. <br /><i>\n  <br /></i><b>Persepolis</b> paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran: of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life and of the enormous toll repressive regimes exact on the individual spirit. Marjane\u2019s child's-eye-view of dethroned emperors, state-sanctioned whippings, and heroes of the revolution allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own extraordinary family. Intensely personal, profoundly political, and wholly original, <b>Persepolis</b> is at once a story of growing up and a stunning reminder of the human cost of war and political repression. It shows how we carry on, through laughter and tears, in the face of absurdity. And, finally, it introduces us to an irresistible little girl with whom we cannot help but fall in love.",

Written in collaboration with celebrated American architect Ogden Codman, Jr., Wharton's first book is a comprehensive look at the history and character of turn-of-the-century interior design, moving from historical traditions to the distinctive styles of contemporary taste. Published in association with the Mount Press, this beautiful hardcover facsimile is carefully reproduced from the first edition published in 1897 and includes all 56 original plates-illustrating furniture, moldings, and interior styles of the 19th-century-and features d\u00e9collage edges as well as a new introduction from renowned scholar Richard Guy Wilson. The Mount is a magnificent estate Edith Wharton designed and built in 1902 as a writer's retreat in the beautiful Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts.",

The moon's going to be scrapped soon and a new one commissioned - but they've been saying that for years ... All is not well with the universe, and it's because the mortals are running the show. It's time for a Higher Power to take charge ...<br /><br />ODDS AND GODS<br />It's a god's life at the Sunnyvoyde Residential Home for retired deities. Everlasting life can be a real drag when all you've got to look forward to is cauliflower cheese on Wednesdays. But things are about to change, because those almighty duffers Thor, Odin and Frey have restored a thousand-year-old traction engine ... and the thing actually works. Then there's Osiris, preparing to set out on a quest that will test his wheelchair to the very limits. Only one thing might save the world. Dentures.",

    "description": "In this groundbreaking book, Sheridan Blau introduces the literature workshop as the most effective approach to solving many of the classic instructional problems that perplex beginning and veteran teachers of literature. Through lively re-creations of actual workshops that he regularly conducts for students and teachers, Blau invites his readers to become active participants in workshops on such topics as:<br /><br /><br />helping students read more difficult texts than they think they can read<br />where interpretations come from<br />the problem of background knowledge in teaching classic texts<br />how to deal with competing and contradictory interpretations<br />what's worth saying about a literary text<br />balancing respect for readers with respect for texts and intellectual authority<br />ensuring that literary discussions are lively and productive<br />how to develop valuable and engaging writing assignments.<br />Each workshop includes reflections on what transpired and a discussion of the workshop's rationale and outcomes in the larger context of an original and practice-based theory of literary competence and instruction.",

    "description": "\"A new and authentic voice of the urban Latino experience.\" --Esmeralda Santiago, author of <b>When I Was Puerto Rican</b><br /><br />In a stunning narrative combining the gritty rhythms of Junot Diaz with the noir\u00a0\u00a0genius of Walter Mosley, <b>Bodega Dreams</b> announces the arrival of a writer who <i>The Village Voice</i> has already hailed as \"a Writer on the Verge.\"<br /><br />The word is out in Spanish Harlem: Willy Bodega is king.\u00a0\u00a0Need college tuition for your daughter?\u00a0\u00a0Start-up funds for your fruit stand?\u00a0\u00a0Bodega can help.\u00a0\u00a0He gives everyone a leg up, in exchange only for loyalty--and a steady income from the drugs he pushes.<br /><br />Lyric, inspired, and darkly funny, this powerful debut novel brilliantly evokes the trial of Chino, a smart, promising young man to whom Bodega turns for a favor.\u00a0\u00a0Chino is drawn to Bodega's street-smart idealism, but soon finds himself over his head, navigating an underworld of switchblade tempers, turncoat morality, and murder.",

    "description": "The central figure of this novel is a young man whose parents were executed for conspiring to steal atomic secrets for Russia.<br /><br />His name is Daniel Isaacson, and as the story opens, his parents have been dead for many years. He has had a long time to adjust to their deaths. He has not adjusted. <br /><br />Out of the shambles of his childhood, he has constructed a new life\u2014marriage to an adoring girl who gives him a son of his own, and a career in scholarship. It is a life that enrages him.<br /><br />In the silence of the library at Columbia University, where he is supposedly writing a Ph.D. dissertation, Daniel composes something quite different.<br /><br />It is a confession of his most intimate relationships\u2014with his wife, his foster parents, and his kid sister Susan, whose own radicalism so reproaches him. <br /><br />It is a book of memories: riding a bus with his parents to the ill-fated Paul Robeson concert in Peekskill; watching the FBI take his father away; appearing with Susan at rallies protesting their parents\u2019 innocence; visiting his mother and father in the Death House.<br /><br />It is a book of investigation: transcribing Daniel\u2019s interviews with people who knew his parents, or who knew about them; and logging his strange researches and discoveries in the library stacks.<br /><br />It is a book of judgments of everyone involved in the case\u2014lawyers, police, informers, friends, and the Isaacson family itself.<br /><br />It is a book rich in characters, from elderly grand- mothers of immigrant culture, to covert radicals of the McCarthy era, to hippie marchers on the Pen-tagon. It is a book that spans the quarter-century of American life since World War II. It is a book about the nature of Left politics in this country\u2014its sacrificial rites, its peculiar cruelties, its humility, its bitterness. It is a book about some of the beautiful and terrible feelings of childhood. It is about the nature of guilt and innocence, and about the relations of people to nations. <br /><br />It is <i>The Book of Daniel</i>.",

    "description": "The sequel to Thomas Wolfe's remarkable first novel, <i>Look Homeward, Angel, Of Time and the River</i> is one of the great classics of American literature. The book chronicles the maturing of Wolfe's autobiographical character, Eugene Gant, in his desperate search for fulfillment, making his way from small-town North Carolina to the wider world of Harvard University, New York City, and Europe. In a massive, ambitious, and boldly passionate novel, Wolfe examines the passing of time and the nature of the creative process, as Gant slowly but ecstatically embraces the urban life, recognizing it as a necessary ordeal for the birth of his creative genius as a writer. <br /> The work of an exceptionally expressive writer of fertile imagination and startling emotional intensity, <i>Of Time and the River</i> illuminates universal truths about art and life, city and country, past and present. It is a novel that is majestic and enduring. As P. M. Jack observed in <i>The New York Times,</i> \"It is a triumphant demonstration that Thomas Wolfe has the stamina to produce a magnificent epic of American life.\" <br /> This edition, published in celebration of Wolfe's centennial anniversary, contains a new introduction by Pat Conroy.",

    "description": "Louise Rosenblatt's \"Literature as Exploration\" has influenced literary theorists and teachers of literature at all levels for six decades. Now reissued in an attractive trade edition, it features a new foreword by Wayne Booth, a new preface and retrospective chapter by the author, and an updated list of suggested readings.In \"Literature as Exploration,\" Rosenblatt presents her unique theory of literature and focuses on the immense, often untapped, potential for the study and teaching of literature in a democratic society. The author's philosophy is frequently cited as the first presentation of reader-response theory, but she differs from her successors in emphasizing both the reader and the text. Her \"transactional\" theory of literature examines the reciprocal nature of the literary experience and explains why meaning is neither \"in\" the text nor \"in\" the reader. Each reading is \"a particular event involving a particular reader and a particular text under particular circumstances.\" And teachers of literature, Rosenblatt argues, play a pivotal role in influencing how students perform in response to a text.<br /><br />Students, teachers, and scholars reading the book for the first time will be as enlightened and challenged by this classic work as earlier generations have been. The many readers of the previous editions of \"Literature as Exploration\" will want to own this special edition, with its larger format, elegant typography, and new supporting materials.",

    "description": "When <em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em> was first published in English, it was hailed as \"a work of the boldest mastery, originality, and richness\" by critic Elizabeth Hardwick and named one of the best books of 1984 by the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>. It went on to win the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Book Prize for Fiction and quickly became an international bestseller. Twenty years later, the novel has established itself as a modern classic. To commemorate the anniversary of its first English-language publication, HarperCollins is proud to offer a special hardcover edition.<br /><br />A young woman in love with a man torn between his love for her and his incorrigible womanizing; one of his mistresses and her humbly faithful lover -- these are the two couples whose story is told in this masterful novel.<br /><br />Controlled by day, Tereza's jealousy awakens by night, transformed into ineffably sad death-dreams, while Tomas, a successful surgeon, alternates loving devotion to the dependent Tereza with the ardent pursuit of other women. Sabina, an independent, free-spirited artist, lives her life as a series of betrayals -- of parents, husband, country, love itself -- whereas her lover, the intellectual Franz, loses all because of his earnest goodness and fidelity.<br /><br />In a world in which lives are shaped by irrevocable choices and by fortuitous events, a world in which everything occurs but once, existence seems to lose its substance, its weight. Hence we feel, says the novelist, \"the unbearable lightness of being\" -- not only as the consequence of our private acts but also in the public sphere, and the two inevitably intertwine.<br /><br />This magnificent novel encompasses the extremes of comedy and tragedy, and embraces, it seems, all aspects of human existence. It juxtaposes geographically distant places (Prague, Geneva, Paris, Thailand, the United States, a forlorn Bohemian village); brilliant and playful reflections (on \"eternal return,\" on kitsch, on man and animals -- Tomas and Tereza have a beloved doe named Karenin); and a variety of styles (from the farcical to the elegiac) to take its place as perhaps the major achievement of one of the world's truly great writers.",

    "description": "\"California, Labor Day weekend...early, with ocean fog still in the streets, outlaw motorcyclists wearing chains, shades &amp; greasy Levis roll out from damp garages, all-night diners &amp; cast-off one-night pads in Frisco, Hollywood, Berdoo &amp; East Oakland, heading for the Monterey peninsula, north of Big Sur...The Menace is loose again.\" Thus begins Hunter S. Thompson's vivid account of his experiences with California's most notorious motorcycle gang, the Hell's Angels.<br /><br /> In the mid-60s, Thompson spent almost two years living with the controversial Angels, cycling up &amp; down the coast, reveling in the anarchic spirit of their clan, and, as befits their name, raising hell. His book successfully captures a singular moment in American history, when the biker lifestyle was 1st defined, &amp; when such countercultural movements were electrifying &amp; horrifying America. Thompson, the creator of Gonzo journalism, writes with his usual bravado, energy &amp; brutal honesty, &amp; with a nuanced &amp; incisive eye; as The New Yorker pointed out, \"For all its uninhibited &amp; sardonic humor, Thompson's book is a thoughtful piece of work.\" As illuminating now as when originally published in '67, Hell's Angels is a gripping portrait, the best account we have of the truth behind an American legend.",

    "description": "When Blinking Jack Stokes met Ruby Pitt Woodrow, she was twenty and he was forty. She was the carefully raised daughter of Carolina gentry and he was a skinny tenant farmer who had never owned anything in his life. She was newly widowed after a disastrous marriage to a brutal drifter. He had never asked a woman to do more than help him hitch a mule. They didn't fall in love so much as they simply found each other and held on for dear life.<br /><br />Kaye Gibbons's first novel, <b>Ellen Foster</b>, won the Sue Kaufman Prize for First Fiction from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters and the praise of writers from Walker Percy to Eudora Welty. In <b>A Virtuous Woman</b>, Gibbons transcends her early promise, creating a multilayered and indelibly convincing portrait of two seemingly ill-matched people who somehow miraculously make a marriage.",

    "description": "Travis Anderson has a psychic gift. Or so he thinks. So far he's used his premonitions only to acquire the external trappings of success -- pretty wife, big house, shiny Range Rover. But when ominous visions invade his consciousness, his yuppie contentment is threatened and his business faces an audit from the IRS. <br /><br /> Drowning in mounting financial problems and apparent mental illness, Travis clings to a raft of booze and pills. An intervention lands him in a rehab facility with outlandish ideas about healing mind and body. His sole counsel is no 12-stepper, but a Hindu holy man who claims to be the final incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the Hindu god who is the preserver of the universe.",

    "description": "<em>Critical Theory Today</em> is the essential introduction to contemporary criticial theory. It provides clear, simple explanations and concrete examples of complex concepts, making a wide variety of commonly used critical theories accessible to novices without sacrificing any theoretical rigor or thoroughness.<br /><br />This new edition provides in-depth coverage of the most common approaches to literary analysis today: feminism, psychoanalysis, Marxism, reader-response theory, new criticism, structuralism and semiotics, deconstruction, new historicism, cultural criticism, lesbian/gay/queer theory, African American criticism, and postcolonial criticism. The chapters provide an extended explanation of each theory, using examples from everyday life, popular culture, and literary texts; a list of specific questions critics who use that theory ask about literary texts; an interpretation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's <em>The Great Gatsby</em> through the lens of each theory; a list of questions for further practice to guide readers in applying each theory to different literary works; and a bibliography of primary and secondary works for further reading.",

    "description": "When the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima in August 1945, killing 100,000 men, women and children, a new era in human history opened. Written only a year after the disaster, John Hersey brought the event vividly alive with this heartrending account of six men and women who survived despite all the odds. A further chapter was added when, forty years later, he returned to Hiroshima to discover how the same six people had struggled to cope with catastrophe and with often crippling disease. The result is a devastating picture of the long-term effects of one bomb.",

The book follows their orgies, their despair, and finally their terror when they abandon all hope as the forces of darkness close in and make them prisoners in their own White House, where they cry out like doomed animals. As he has done in such texts as Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72, Hell's Angels and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Thompson has again wandered into the savage vortex of political power, and emerged, barely, with this bizarre tale of life within the Belly of the Great American Beast.",

Until now, clues about what happened to these two Everest pioneers had been scant and misleading. Until now, no one has known whether they reached the summit. Until now, no one has known where or how they perished. </p><p> This is a detective story of the first order. It is the story not just of Mallory and Irvine's last climb, but of the team of climbers and researchers who, together, found the body of perhaps Britain's greatest mountaineer and uncovered the startling story he had waited so long to reveal. Written by the three key members of the team, and incorporating extensive interviews with other team members, GHOSTS OF EVEREST is the dramatic unfolding of both the 1999 and 1924 expeditions, woven together into a compelling narrative. </p><p> This book is the definitive account and has become an instant classic.</p>",

In These Strange Ashes, Elliot captures the mysteries and stark realities surrounding the colorful and primitive world in which she ministered. More than just a recounting of her early days, this is a beautifully crafted and deeply personal reflection on the important questions of life and a remarkable testimony to an authentic Christian commitment.",

With tough, gritty detachment, he describes the stages of his own drug addiction and physical and emotional deterioration.<br /><br />Kentucky Ham takes him from the squalor of the East Village crash pads to his father's literary hideaway in Tangier, and finally to incarceration at the Federal Narcotics Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky. Through both these autobiographical novels, William S. Burroughs, Jr., tells a story of generational isolation that is as relevant today as when it was first written.",

It is the best-selling account of the martyrdom of Jim Elliot and four other missionaries at the hands of the Huaorani Indians in Ecuador.<br /><br />Shadow of the Almighty has inspired Christians since its first publication in 1958. Elisabeth Elliot makes full use of Jim's revealing diaries to fill in the details of a life completely committed to God's service.<br /><br />This story was reintroduced to today's audiences in 2006 thanks to the release of the film, End of the Spear, which tells for the first time the killings from the perspective of the Huaorani.",

Rising above their own agendas, the Ultimates forge ahead with the introduction of new allies and face a major global threat. <br /><br />Collects THE ULTIMATES VOL.1: SUPER-HUMAN and THE ULTIMATES VOL. 2: HOMELAND SECURITY.

This collection, the only one to appear during Shirley Jackson's lifetime, unites \"The Lottery:\" with twenty-four equally unusual stories. Together they demonstrate Jack son's remarkable range--from the hilarious to the truly horrible--and power as a storyteller.<br /><br />(back cover)",

Then she discovers knitting, and it s as if she s been thrown a cashmerino lifeline. Soon Scottie and her best friend Amanda along with new friends Bella and Tay find themselves hanging at their local yarn store, a magical place called KnitWit, bound together by a yen for yarn and a hunger for friendship. Their stitches and their relationships become so intertwined that it s hard to remember which came first: the girls or the purls. <br /><i>Chicks With Sticks</i> is not just for crafty types (through it does include several knitting patterns and projects). It s for anyone who s ever found friends in the most unlikely place or wanted to. Sometimes you just need some string and sticks with some full-fat hot chocolate on the side to get you there.\"",

    "description": "<b>The classic supernatural thriller by an author who helped define the genre.</b><br /><br />First published in 1959 under the title <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i>, Shirley Jackson's beloved novel has been hailed as a perfect work of unnerving terror. It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of the psychic phenomena called \"haunting\"; Theodora, his lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powers--and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.<br /><br />\"Makes your blood chill and your scalp prickle. . . . Shirley Jackson is the master of the haunted tale.\"--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>",

    "description": "The turning point for the entire Star Wars saga is at hand<i>\n  <br /></i><br />After years of civil war, the Separatists have battered the already faltering Republic nearly to the point of collapse. On Coruscant, the Senate watches anxiously as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine aggressively strips away more and more constitutional liberties in the name of safeguarding the Republic. Yoda, Mace Windu, and their fellow Masters grapple with the Chancellor\u2019 s disturbing move to assume control of the Jedi Council. And Anakin Skywalker, the prophesied Chosen One, destined to bring balance to the Force, is increasingly consumed by his fear that his secret love, Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, will die. <br /><br />As the combat escalates across the galaxy, the stage is set for an explosive endgame: Obi-Wan undertakes a perilous mission to destroy the dreaded Separatist military leader General Grievous. Palpatine, eager to secure even greater control, subtly influences public opinion to turn against the Jedi. And a conflicted Anakin\u2013tormented by unspeakable visions\u2013 edges dangerously closer to the brink of a galaxy-shaping decision. It remains only for Darth Sidious, whose shadow looms ever larger, to strike the final staggering blow against the Republic . . . and to ordain a fearsome new Sith Lord: Darth Vader. <br /><br />Based on the screenplay of the eagerly anticipated final film in George Lucas\u2019s epic saga, bestselling Star Wars author Matthew Stover\u2019s novel crackles with action, captures the iconic characters in all their complexity, and brings a space opera masterpiece full circle in stunning style.<br /><br />Features a bonus section following the novel that includes a primer on the <i>Star Wars</i> expanded universe, and over half a dozen excerpts from some of the most popular <i>Star Wars</i> books of the last thirty years!",

    "description": "Shirley Jackson, author of the classic short story <b>The Lottery</b>, was known for her terse, haunting prose. But the writer possessed another side, one which is delightfully exposed in this hilariously charming memoir of her family's life in rural Vermont. Fans of <b>Please Don't Eat the Daisies</b>, <b>Cheaper by the Dozen</b>, and anything Erma Bombeck ever wrote will find much to recognize in Shirley Jackson's home and neighborhood: children who won't behave, cars that won't start, furnaces that break down, a pugnacious corner bully, household help that never stays, and a patient, capable husband who remains lovingly oblivious to the many thousands of things mothers and wives accomplish every single day.\"Our house,\" writes Jackson, \"is old, noisy, and full. When we moved into it we had two children and about five thousand books; I expect that when we finally overflow and move out again we will have perhaps twenty children and easily half a million books.\" Jackson's literary talents are in evidence everywhere, as is her trenchant, unsentimental wit. Yet there is no mistaking the happiness and love in these pages, which are crowded with the raucous voices of an extraordinary family living a wonderfully ordinary life.",

    "description": "Offering a unique perspective and unusual insight into modern Japan and its wartime past, <i>Audrey Hepburn's Neck</i> is also a shrewd study of cross-cultural obsessions, and of erotic, romantic and familial love. <br /> The American author Alan Brown crosses both racial and cultural lines to tell his story through the eyes of a young, handsome Japanese cartoonist, Toshiyuki (\"Toshi\") Okamoto, who traces his strong attraction to Western women bock to his ninth birthday, when his mother took him to see Audrey Hepburn in the movie \"Roman Holiday.\" <br /> Leaving behind a sad, silent childhood -- which was spent living in two rooms above the family noodle shop on an isolated peninsula in the far north of Japan -- Toshi moves to Tokyo to pursue his career. There he falls under the spell of three Americans: his best friend and confidante, the generous and extroverted Paul, a gay advertising copywriter who has plenty of his romantic mishaps with Japanese men; Jane, his glamorous but emotionally unstable teacher at the Very Romantic English Academy, with whom Toshi has a hazardous sexual affair; and, finally, the lovely and talented composer, Lucy, with whom Toshi falls in love. <br /> The novel deftly moves back and forth between present and past, as Toshi explores his unhappy childhood, the reasons behind his mother's unexplained abandonment when he was eight years old, and her move to a seaside inn across the peninsula. As the novel draws to a close, tragic events, both public and personal, bring past and present together, revealing the painful truth of Toshi's parents' lives during World War II, and a secret in Toshi's own past that, in the end, gives him the strength and knowledge to confront the future.",

For the first fifty years of her life nothing at all out of the ordinary had ever happened to her. She was an old-maid watchmaker living contentedly with her spinster sister and their elderly father in the tiny Dutch house over their shop. Their uneventful days, as regulated as their own watches, revolved around their abiding love for one another. However, with the Nazi invasion and occupation of Holland, a story did ensue. <br /><br />Corrie ten Boom and her family became leaders in the Dutch Underground, hiding Jewish people in their home in a specially built room and aiding their escape from the Nazis. For their help, all but Corrie found death in a concentration camp. <i>The Hiding Place</i> is their story.",

    "description": "For connoisseurs of imaginative fiction, the novels of Jonathan Carroll are a special treat that occupy a space all their own. His surreal fictions, which deftly mix the everyday with the extraordinary, have won him a devoted following. Now, in <i>Glass Soup</i>, Carroll continues to astound . . . .<br /><br />The realm of the dead is built from the dreams--and nightmares--of the living. Octopuses drive buses. God is a polar bear. And a crowded highway literally leads to hell.<br /><br />Once before, Vincent Ettrich and his lover, Isabelle Neukor, crossed over from life to death and back again. Now Isabelle bears a very special child, who may someday restore the ever-changing mosaic that is reality. Unless the agents of Chaos can lure her back to the land of the dead--and trap her there forever.<br /><br /><i>Glass Soup</i> is another exquisite and singular creation from the author <i>January</i> magazine described as \"incapable of writing a bad book much less an uninteresting one.\"",

    "description": "<i>Animal Farm</i> is a novella by George Orwell, &amp; is the most famous satirical allegory of Soviet totalitarianism. Published in 1946, the book reflects events leading up to &amp; during the Stalin era. Orwell, a democratic socialist, &amp; a member of the Independent Labour Party for many years, was a critic of Joseph Stalin, and was suspicious of Moscow-directed Stalinism after his experiences with the NKVD during the Spanish Civil War.<br /><br />Orwell wrote the book following his experiences during the Spanish Civil War, which are described in another one of his books, <i>Homage to Catalonia</i>. He intended it to be a strong condemnation of what he saw as the Stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals. For the preface of a Ukrainian edition he prepared in 1947, he described what gave him the idea of setting the book on a farm: \"...I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, &amp; that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.\"<br /><br />This Ukrainian edition was an early propaganda use of the book. It was printed to be distributed among the Soviet citizens of Ukraine who were some of the many millions of displaced persons thruout Europe at the end of WW2. The American occupation forces considered the edition to be propaganda printed on illegal presses, &amp; handed 1,500 confiscated copies of Animal Farm over to the Soviet authorities. The politics in the book also affected Britain, with Orwell reporting that Ernest Bevin was \"terrified\" that it may cause embarrassment if published before the 1945 general election.<br /><br /> In recent years, the book has been used to compare new movements that overthrow heads of a corrupt &amp; undemocratic government or organisation, only to eventually become corrupt &amp; oppressive themselves as they succumb to the trappings of power &amp; begin using violent and dictatorial methods to keep it. Such analogies have been used for many former African colonies such as Zimbabwe &amp; the Democratic Republic of Congo, whose succeeding African-born rulers were accused of being as corrupt as, or worse than, the European colonists they supplanted.<br /> The book also clearly ponders whether a focus of power in one person is healthy for a society. The book leaves the ending slightly ambiguous in this regard.<br /><br /> Perhaps the largest overriding theme in <i>Animal Farm</i> is the famous quote by Lord Acton, \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"",

And seldom has the hidden eye of British Intelligence selected such an unlikely champion as Harry Pendel\u2014a charmer, a dreamer, an evader, a fabulist and presiding genius of the house of Pendel &amp; Braithwaite Co. Limitada, Tailors to Royalty, formerly of London and presently of Panama City.</p><p>Yet there is a logic to the spies' choice. Everybody who is anybody in Central America passes through Pendel's doors. He dresses politicos and crooks and conmen. His fitting room hears more confidences than a priest's confessional. And when Harry Pendel doesn't hear things <i>as such</i>\u2014well, he hears them anyway, by other means.</p><p>For what is a tailor for, if not to disduise reality with appearance? What is truth if not the plaything of the artist? And what are spies and politicians and journalists if not themselves selectors and manipulators of the truth for their own ends?</p><p>In a thrilling, hilarious novel, le Carr\u00e9 has provided us with a satire about the fate of truth in modern times. Once again, he has effortlessly expanded the borders of the spy story to bring us a magnificent entertainment straight out of the pages of tomorrow's history.</p><p>JOHN LE CARR\u00c9 was born in 1931. After attending the universities of Bern and Oxford, he taught at Eton and spent five years in the British Foreign Service. His third novel, <i>The Spy Who Came In from the Cold</i>, secured him a worldwide reputation, which was solidified by the acclaim for his trilogy, <i>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, The Honourable Schoolboy</i> and <i>Smiley's People</i>. His mostly autobiographical novel, <i>A Perfect Spy</i>, wa followed by <i>The Russia House, The Night Manager</i> and <i>Our Game</i>. <i>The Tailor of Panama</i> is his sixteenth novel.</p><p>John le Carr\u00e9 lives in Cornwall, England.</p>",

As Death's apprentice, he'll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won't need time off for family funerals. The position is everything Mort thought he'd ever wanted, until he discovers that this perfect job can be a killer on his love life.",
